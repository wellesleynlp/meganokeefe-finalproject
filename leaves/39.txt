Let it Fly Lyrics

[Hook:Roscoe Dash]
Hands in the air, Drinks in the air
Hands in the air, Drinks in the air
Hands in the air,(let let let let it fly)
Drinks in the air,(let let let let it fly)
We ballin in here, (let let let let it fly)
(Let it fly let it fly let let let let it fly)

[Verse 1: Maino]
Nigga im world tourin, Cars foreign
Wrist in the air, im audemar-in'
Champagne glass, Drinks pourin
Party hard til the mornin
Brooklyn boy get Southern love
Shake your ass, show me love
Got me open, im throwin Dubs
Raise your glass come Fuck with us
Im bout my business steady drinkin I just (let it fly)
Like there's wings on my dollars I just (let it fly)
Hands in the air, oh yeah go head come on and (let it fly)
Lets go lets (let it fly) Get ready (let it fly)

[Hookx2]

[Hook: Maino]
Fist full of dollars in the air baby (let it fly)
Sparkles on top of bottles hold them up and (let it fly)
Hands in the air, oh yeah come on and (let it fly)
Lets go lets (let it fly) Get ready (let it fly)

[Verse2: Maino]
Now im all about my business, my business is so tremendous
Spend weekends with different women
Im livin just for the minute
You holdin my intentions the way you turnin and twistin
Your body in those positions you got me prepared for (Sounds like chicken or strippin ahaa)

[Hookx2]

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Now we party hard, extra cake, I throw it up and watch it elevate
And rain rain on plain Jane and them lame niggas that love to hate
We got dough, we make bread, they reachin out like they ain't fair
The way these white guys dance around, you would have thought they ain't dead
But now we ain't for trainin they flyin out, they got these ladies tryin to scout
Like it's playoff time, and in our time, left on the clock with a tied score
I'm Van Chancellor, approachin to her, with some alcohol and some slow music
And to think it all started with a smile and a wink and of course we inside drink
