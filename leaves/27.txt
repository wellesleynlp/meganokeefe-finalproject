Too Young To Fall In Love Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You say our love
Is like dynamite
Open your eyes
Because it's like fire and ice
Well you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Why don't you just set me free

[Chorus]
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
Much too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young, too young
To fall in love

[Verse 2]
Run for the hills
We're both sinners and saints
Not a woman, but a whore
I can just taste the hate
Well now I'm killing you
Watch your face turning blue
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You say our love
Is like dynamite
Well its no surprise
Cause you've got one-way eyes
Well you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street

[Chorus]
