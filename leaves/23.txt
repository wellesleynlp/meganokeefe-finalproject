In a Young Man's Mind Lyrics

Well in a young man's mind
It's a simple world
There's a little bit of music
And the rest is girls

In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Oh, in a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)

Hey!

Oh, back when I was a boy
Growin' up was rough
We're dealin' with the teachers
And the folks and all that stuff
But I remember that day
It was in the second grade
When I met Laura
And then I couldn't get enough

In a young man's mind
It's a simple world
There's a little bit of music
And the rest is girls

In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Oh, in a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)

Hey-yeah!

A kid with a guitar
What does he wanna do?
We'll be like Pete Townsend, Jimmy Page, and Hendrix too
We're gonna learn how to play
And practice it everyday
But I was really feelin'
I might meet some ladies this way

In a young man's mind
It's a simple world
There's a little bit of music
And the rest is girls

In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)

In a young man's mind (got nothin' to lose)
In a young man's mind (he got nothin', too true)
In a young man's mind (you know he got the blues)
In a young man's mind (and he just might let them do that)

Oh yeah!

Now I go to a man
And I do what I can
And I travel across this land
In a rock and roll band
But I'm so likely inclined
There's one thing on my mind
A predilection for affection
Of the female kind

In a young man's mind
It's a simple world
There's a little bit of music
And the rest is girls

In a young man's mind
It's a simple world
There's a little bit of music
And the rest is girls

In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Oh, in a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
A young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
In a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Oh, in a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Yeah, in a young man's mind (in a young man's mind)
Alright, a young man's mind (hey-ey-ey) (in a young man's mind)

In a young man's mind, in a young man's mind
A young man's mind, in a young man's mind (x3)

Hey!
Oh!
