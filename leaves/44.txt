Sovereign Lyrics

I'm not alone now
You're listening too
Maybe we will be friends and
This song is the glue

You're not alone
Now you're singing
You're not alone too

Maybe we will be friends
And someday thats true

Bathed in the green
My heart is Kathleen
Oh bathed in the open air
I am set free

I'm not alone now
You're listening too

Truely we will be friends
And someday thats so

You're not alone
Now you're singing
You're not alone too

Maybe we will be friends
Someday thats true

Bathed in the green
My heart is Kathleen
Oh bathed in the open air
I am set free

Bathed in the green
My heart is Kathleen
Oh bathed in the open air
I am with me

Bathed, bathed in the open air
I am with Jean
Bathed in the open air
I am with me
