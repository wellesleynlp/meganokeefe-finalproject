Song For Ireland Lyrics

Walking all the day
By all towers where falcons build their nests
In silver wings they fly
For they know the call for freedom in their breasts
We saw Black Head against the sky
With craggy rocks that run down to the sea
When living on your western shore
Saw summer sun set, I asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic Sea
And sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day
In old pubs where fiddlers love to play
Saw one take the bow
To play a reel that was so grand and gay
I stood on dingle beach and cast
In the wild foam for the Atlantic bass
When living on your western shore
Saw the summer sunset, I asked form more
I stood by your Atlantic Sea
And sang a song for Ireland

Laughing all the day
With true friends who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news
And singing songs to pass the night away
We watched the galway salmon run
Like silver dancing, darting in the sun
When living on your western shore
Saw the summer sunset, I asked form more
I stood by your Atlantic Sea
And sang a song for Ireland

Dreaming in the night
I saw a land where no-man had to fight
And waking in your dawn
I saw you crying in the morning light
When lying where the falcons fly
They twist and turn all in your air-blue sky
When living on your western shore
Saw the summer sunset, I asked no more
I stood by your Atlantic sea
And sang a song for Ireland
