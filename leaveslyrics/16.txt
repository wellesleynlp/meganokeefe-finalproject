Ten Men Lyrics

Vacations in Europe
Sensational sense
We made the most of
Your inheritance

Come, you son of a gun
How can it be done?
We're still on the run

Ten men all rolled into one
(Ten men in one)
Ten men in a prodigal son
(Whirlwind young gun)
Ten men all rolled into one
(Ten men in one)
Ten men in a prodigal son
(Whirlwind young gun)
Ten men transcend

We're sitting pretty
Admiring the view
Indulging in pleasures
You can't take with you

Yes, I am obsessed
I must confess
Oh, I need a rest!

Ten men all rolled into one
(Ten men in one)
Ten men in a prodigal son
(Whirlwind young gun)
Ten men all rolled into one
(Ten men in one)
Ten men in a prodigal son
(Whirlwind young gun)

Life's too short this time
Life's too short this time
Life's too short this time
Life's too short this time

I need experience
Like a teenager
All this exuberance
Let's grow up later!

I need
Like a teenager
All this
Let's grow up later!
