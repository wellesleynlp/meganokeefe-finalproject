Vinland Lyrics

Forward : ride the ocean's waves
Be bold : glory to the brave

Deep the sea : above me eternal sky
Freezing winds : cold to the limbs : the waves are high
Sleepless nights : the bleak moonlight : the chill and damp
By morning light : a strip of land we see

Vinland : crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland : follow the stars and the sign of the raven
Vinland : watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland : plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea

The wind : mighty : fills your sail
Onward : to the land in your fathers' tale

Forward brothers : reward awaits the bold and brave
White sons of north : through hail and storms : we rode the waves
We beach the ship upon the coast of western land
And rest our tired limbs among the reed and sand

Vinland : crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland : follow the stars and the sign of the raven
Vinland : watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland : plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea
