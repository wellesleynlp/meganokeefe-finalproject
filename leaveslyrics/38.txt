Open Air Lyrics

You need open air, all this open air
We had open air, so much open air
And you put your body out my window like
You put your body out my window like
You need open air, all this open air
We had open air, so much open air
And you put your body out my window like
You put your body out my window
With the top down, we were headed South with the top down
All the way East in our nightgowns
All the way West with our knife out
Headed North with the top down, with our knife out
With our knife out
