Open Air Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I had my feet in the water
& right when I was about to get up suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line & a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
& what a difference it makes you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe
What a difference it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love

[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, & you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
& what a difference it makes you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe
What a difference it makes it easy to love

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
Baby I could show you the world
& the seed that’s inside of my heart baby
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won’t go back again
It’s better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher & higher
Don’t ever go under no more

[Hook x2]
