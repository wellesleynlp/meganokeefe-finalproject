Worship Lyrics

Two nuns on the sea shore
Stand apart from one another –
Black wood posts
Mesmerised by the sea god

Mesmerised by the sea god

One nun with human failings
And weary legs
Sinks to the sand
And sits like a child
Sinks to the sand
And sits like a child

A golden stripe appears
On the western horizon –
A golden stripe appears:
A signal from the sea god
That he understands tiredness

One staunch sister
Stays standing
One staunch sister
Stays standing
And the sun sets

And the sun
Sets
