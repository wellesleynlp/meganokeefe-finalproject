{200832: [u"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Chap. 1 Excerpt) by\xa0J.K.\xa0Rowling", u'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone (Chap. 1 Excerpt) Lyrics\n\nThe Boy Who LivedMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\'d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\'t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\'t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\'s sister, but they hadn\'t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\'t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\'t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n"Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\'s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\'t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\'t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\'t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\'t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n"The Potters, that\'s right, that\'s what I heard -"\n\n"- yes, their son, Harry -"\n\n[....]\n\n"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\'t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn\'t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he\'d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\'t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ("Won\'t!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"\n\n"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don\'t know about that, but it\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\'ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?"\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\'t have a sister.\n\n"No," she said sharply. "Why?"\n\n"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting\nstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."\n\n"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\nknow... her crowd."\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\'d heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son -- he\'d be about Dudley\'s age now, wouldn\'t he?"\n\n"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n"What\'s his name again? Howard, isn\'t it?"\n\n"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."\n\n"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite\nagree."\n\nHe didn\'t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn\'t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....\n\n[...]\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\'d have thought he\'d just popped out of the ground. The cat\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\'s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known."\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\'t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\'t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n"How did you know it was me?" she asked.\n\n"My dear Professor, I \'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly."\n\n"You\'d be stiff if you\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day," said\nProfessor McGonagall.\n\n"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here."\'\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n"Oh yes, everyone\'s celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. "You\'d think they\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\'s going on. It was on their news." She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\'re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."\n\n"You can\'t blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."\n\n"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that\'s no\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors."\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\'t, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?"\n\n"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"\n\n"A what?"\n\n"A lemon drop. They\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\'m rather fond of."\n\n"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if\nYou-Know-Who has gone -"\n\n"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \'You- Know-Who\' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \'You-Know-Who.\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\'s name.\n\n"I know you haven \'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you\'re different. Everyone knows you\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."\n\n"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will never have."\n\n"Only because you\'re too -- well -- noble to use them."\n\n"It\'s lucky it\'s dark. I haven\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs."\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\'s saying? About why he\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?"\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n"What they\'re saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\'re -- dead."\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n"Lily and James... I can\'t believe it... I didn\'t want to believe it... Oh, Albus..."\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I know..." he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\'s voice trembled as she went on. "That\'s not all. They\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\'s son, Harry. But -- he couldn\'t. He couldn\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\'re saying that when he couldn\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\'s power somehow broke -- and that\'s why he\'s gone.\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n"It\'s -- it\'s true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he\'s done... all the people he\'s killed... he couldn\'t kill a little boy? It\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"\n\n"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\'d be here, by the way?"\n\n"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don\'t suppose you\'re going to tell me why you\'re here, of all places?"\n\n"I\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\'re the only family he has left now."\n\n"You don\'t mean -- you can\'t mean the people who live here?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. "Dumbledore -- you can\'t. I\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\'ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!"\n\n"It\'s the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\'s older. I\'ve written them a letter."\n\n"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\'ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!"\n\n[...]\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?"\n\n"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\'ve got him, sir."\n\n"No problems, were there?"\n\n"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\' over Bristol."\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He\'ll have that scar forever."\n\n"Couldn\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?"\n\n"Even if I could, I wouldn\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\'d better get this over with."\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\' house. "Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you\'ll wake the Muggles!"\n\n"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can\'t stand it -- Lily an\' James dead -- an\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"\n\n"Yes, yes, it\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\'ll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that\'s that. We\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."\n\n"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I\'ll be takin\' Sirius his bike back. G\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\' time by Mrs. Dursley\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!"', u'http://genius.com/Jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-chap-1-excerpt-annotated'], 525795: [u"Harry Potter and the Philosoper's Stone [Ch.5] - Diagon Alley by\xa0J.K.\xa0Rowling", u"Harry Potter and the Philosoper's Stone [Ch.5] - Diagon Alley Lyrics\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. It was a dream, he told himself firmly. I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard. There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d He sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl \u2014\u201d \u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d Hagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets \u2014 bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily. \u201cKnuts?\u201d \u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \u201cUm \u2014 Hagrid?\u201d \u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money \u2014 and you heard Uncle Vernon last night... he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d \u201cBut if their house was destroyed \u2014\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad cold \u2014 an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d \u201cWizards have banks?\u201d \u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \u201cGoblins?\u201d \u201cYeah \u2014 so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe \u2014 \u2018cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you \u2014 gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts \u2014 knows he can trust me, see.\u201d \u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cFlew?\u201d \u201cYeah \u2014 but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter \u2014 er \u2014 speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cSpells \u2014 enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way \u2014 Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life. \u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d \u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d \u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d \u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d \u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d \u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid \u2014 here we go.\u201d They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u201d Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils\u2019 clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1)by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners\u2019 Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \u201cCan we buy all this in London?\u201d Harry wondered aloud. \u201cIf yeh know where to go,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him. \u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle. \u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this \u2014 can this be \u2014?\u201d The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter... what an honor.\u201d He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d \u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d \u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand \u2014 I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d \u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d \u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again \u2014 Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d \u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d \u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g- getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m- myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \u201cMust get on \u2014 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d Doris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. \u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh \u2014 mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d \u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag \u2014 never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject \u2014 now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d Vampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \u201cThree up... two across...\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered \u2014 it wriggled \u2014 in the middle, a small hole appeared \u2014 it grew wider and wider \u2014 a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d He grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons \u2014 All Sizes \u2014 Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \u2014 Self-Stirring \u2014 Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad...\u201d A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium \u2014 Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand \u2014 fastest ever \u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon... \u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was \u2014 \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. \u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d \u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d \u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. \u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d The goblin read the letter carefully. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More\u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in \u2014 Hagrid with some difficulty \u2014 and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering. Harry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \u2014 they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d \u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid. All Harry\u2019s \u2014 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty- nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d \u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook. \u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least \u2014 but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life \u2014 more money than even Dudley had ever had. \u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here \u2014 another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on. \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \u201cI do \u2014 Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been \u2014 imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in. \u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage \u2014 lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d \u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know \u2014 not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s. \u201c\u2014 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in \u2014\u201d \u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were \u2014 he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2018em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles \u2014 look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d \u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like \u2014 like soccer in the Muggle world \u2014 everyone follows Quidditch \u2014 played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls \u2014 sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d \u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d \u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but \u2014\u201d \u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily. \u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d \u201cVol-, sorry \u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d \u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid. They bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of them curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d Hagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again. \u201cJust yer wand left \u2014 A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d Harry felt himself go red. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to \u2014\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at \u2014 an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now \u2014 only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly. \u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it \u2014 it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where...\u201d Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do...\u201d He shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid. \u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. \u201cEr \u2014 yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly. \u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now \u2014 Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d \u201cEr \u2014 well, I\u2019m right-handed,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\u201d Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try \u2014\u201d Harry tried \u2014 but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \u201cNo, no \u2014 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere \u2014 I wonder, now \u2014 yes, why not \u2014 unusual combination \u2014 holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious...\u201d He put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious... curious...\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather \u2014 just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother \u2014 why, its brother gave you that scar.\u201d Harry swallowed. \u201cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things \u2014 terrible, yes, but great.\u201d Harry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life \u2014 and yet \u2014 he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol-, sorry \u2014 I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts \u2014 I did \u2014 still do, \u2019smatter of fact.\u201d Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts, \u201c he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September \u2014 King\u2019s Cross \u2014 it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me... . See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.", u'http://genius.com/Jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-philosopers-stone-ch5-diagon-alley-annotated'], 92406: [u'Harry Potter vs. Voldemort Rap by\xa0Indy\xa0Mogul (Ft.\xa0Erik\xa0Beck & Mark\xa0Douglas)', u"Harry Potter vs. Voldemort Rap Lyrics\n\n[Nice Peter as Lord Voldemort]\nI\u2019m the darkest dark wizard in all of history\nI\u2019ll slay your ass out like Cedric Diggory\nWith a wave of my finger Ill put you on the floor\nYou\u2019s a punk ass little kid without Dumbeldore\n\nI\u2019m the best wizard rapper you ever will see\nYou\u2019re a peewee witch midget with a dead mommy\nI\u2019ve got multiple souls and can raise the dead\nIf you think you can win then you\u2019ve been sorely misled\n\n[Epic Lloyd as Harry Potter]\nYou\u2019s a big bald fairy, you think I\u2019m scared of you\nI smoked a basilisk and I\u2019ll smoke you too\nI got witches in class I got witches in the halls\nIf you look under my cloak, you\u2019ll see my Hagrid size balls\n\nI win at wizard duels, I win at wizard chess\nGot platinum coated DUBS on my Hogwart\u2019s Express\nYou can\u2019t touch me son, I drive magic cars\nI dish out big hurt, you just pass out little scars!\n\n[Nice Peter as Lord Voldemort]\nPoor little Harry, you\u2019re such darling lad\nDo you miss your Uncle?

By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it \u2014 it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High \u2014 like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and \u2014 a letter for Harry.\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives \u2014 he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness \u2014 Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address \u2014 how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching \u2014 spying \u2014 might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026 we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, Harry \u2014 about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first-ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there\u2026 I need that room\u2026 make him get out\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard \u2014 I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley \u2014 go \u2014 just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door \u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat \u2014 something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\nVernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want \u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didn\u2019t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today \u2014\u201d\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one \u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026 shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering\u2026\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday \u2014 and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television \u2014 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun \u2014 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\u2026 twenty\u2026 ten\u2026 nine \u2014 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \u2014 three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.", u'http://genius.com/Jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-ch-3-letters-from-no-one-annotated'], 710057: [u"Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone [chap:7] THE SORTING HAT by\xa0J.K.\xa0Rowling", u'Harry potter and the sorcerer\'s stone [chap:7] THE SORTING HAT Lyrics\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\'s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n"The firs\' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.\n"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\'s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. "Please wait quietly."\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.\n"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking."\nHarry\'s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\'t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\'t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\'d learned and wondering which one she\'d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\'d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\'d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\'d somehow turned his teacher\'s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.\n"What the --?"\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --"\n"My dear Friar, haven\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\'s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?"\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\nNobody answered.\n"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be Sorted, I suppose?"\nA few people nodded mutely.\n"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you know."\n"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony\'s about to start."\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard\nHermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History."\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\'t simply open on to the heavens.\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\'t have let it in the house.\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\n"Oh, you may not think I\'m pretty,\nBut don\'t judge on what you see,\nI\'ll eat myself if you can find\nA smarter hat than me.\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\nFor I\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\nAnd I can cap them all.\nThere\'s nothing hidden in your head\nThe Sorting Hat can\'t see,\nSo try me on and I will tell you\nWhere you ought to be.\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\nWhere they are just and loyal,\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\nif you\'ve a ready mind,\nWhere those of wit and learning,\nWill always find their kind;\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\nYou\'ll make your real friends,\nThose cunning folk use any means\nTo achieve their ends.\nSo put me on! Don\'t be afraid!\nAnd don\'t get in a flap!\nYou\'re in safe hands (though I have none)\nFor I\'m a Thinking Cap!"\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n"So we\'ve just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn\'t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause --\n"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n"Bones, Susan!"\n"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n"Boot, Terry!"\n"RAVENCLAW!"\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\'s twin brothers catcalling.\n"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\'s imagination, after all he\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"\n"HUFFLEPUFF!"\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n"Granger, Hermione!"\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\'t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\'d better get back on the train?\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag."\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\nThere weren\'t many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n"Potter, did she say?"\nThe Harry Potter?"\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\nHmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\'s talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\'s interesting.... So where shall I put you?"\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you\'re sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!"\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\'d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\'s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\'s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n"Thank you!"\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\'t know whether to laugh or not.\n"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly.\n"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"\nHarry\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\'d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak,\n"Can\'t you --?"\nI haven\'t eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don\'t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\'t think I\'ve in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower."\n"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you -- you\'re Nearly Headless Nick!"\n"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\'t going at all the way he wanted.\n"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\'s the Slytherin ghost."\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\'t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest.\n"I\'ve never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n"I\'m half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\'t tell him she was a witch \'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him."\nThe others laughed.\n"What about you, Neville?" said Ron.\n"Well, my gran brought me up and she\'s a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."\nOn Harry\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there\'s so much to learn, I\'m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\'s supposed to be very difficult-"; "You\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\'s turban straight into Harry\'s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\'s forehead.\n"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n"What is it?" asked Percy.\n"N-nothing."\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\'s look -- a feeling that he didn\'t like Harry at all.\n"Who\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.\n"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\'s looking so nervous, that\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\'t want to -- everyone knows he\'s after Quirrell\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape."\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\'t look at him again.\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."\nDumbledore\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n"He\'s not serious?" he muttered to Percy.\n"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\'re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least."\n"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\' smiles had become rather fixed.\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!" And the school bellowed:\n"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\nTeach us something please,\nWhether we be old and bald\nOr young with scabby knees,\nOur heads could do with filling\nWith some interesting stuff,\nFor now they\'re bare and full of air,\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\nBring back what we\'ve forgot,\njust do your best, we\'ll do the rest,\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\'s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\'ll hear about this, I mean it!" barked Percy.\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again. "The Bloody Baron\'s the only one who can control him, he won\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are."\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n" Great food, isn\'t it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. "Get off, Scabbers! He\'s chewing my sheets."\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\'s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\'t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\'t remember the dream at all.', u'http://genius.com/Jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-chap-7-the-sorting-hat-annotated'], 483715: [u'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Script by\xa0Steven\xa0Kloves', u'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Script Lyrics\n\nWe hone in on a snake crawling through the undergrowth.\n\nTITLES\n\nINT.

The Tri-Wizard tournament.\nNow for those of you who do not know,\nthe tri-wizard tournament brings together\nthree schools for a series of magical\ncontests. From each school a single\ncontestant is selected to compete. Now\nlet me be clear, if choosen you stand\nalone. And trust me when I say these\ncontests are not for the faint hearted,\nbut more of that later. For now please\njoin me in welcoming the lovely ladies\nof the Beauxbatons Academy of magic\nand their headmistress Madam Maxime.\n\n\nA group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release\nbutterflies into the air.

Can\'t you see it\'s bothering\nhim, stop it!\n\nMad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider\nwhich is still making a noise.\n\nMAD-EYE\nPerhaps you could give us the last unforgivable\ncurse Miss Granger.\n\nHermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nThe killing curse. Only one person is\nknown to have survived it. And he\'s\nsitting in this room.\n\nHe approaches Harry\'s desk and takes a drink.\n\n\nINT. STAIRS\n\nRON\nBrilliant isn\'t he! Completely demented\nof course.

When they get up they have\nfull heads of grey hair and beards.\n\nGEORGE\nYou said..\n\nFred You said..\n\nThey roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer.

GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSit down please. And now the moment\nyou\'ve all been waiting for, the champions\nselection!\n\nDumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red.

Another name comes out.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur\nDelacour\n\nThe Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes\nout.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe Hogwarts champion...

Only one will hoist this\nchalice of champions, this vessel of\nvictory the tri-wizard cup!\n\nPeople cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another\nname flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry Potter. Harry Potter?\n\nHAGRID\nNo... No.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry Potter!\n\nHERMIONE\nGo on Harry.

The goblet of fire is\nan exceptionally powerful magical object,\nonly an exceptionally powerful conjurer\ncould have hoodwinked it. Magic way\nbeyond the talents of a fourth year.\n\n\nIGOR\nYou seem to have given this a fair bit\nof thought Mad-Eye.\n\nMAD-EYE\nIt was once my job to think as dark\nwizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThat doesn\'t help Alastor.

Offer him up as bait? Potter\nis a boy not a piece of meat.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI agree with Severus. Alastor, keep\nan eye on Harry will you?\n\nMAD-EYE\nI can do that.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nDon\'t let him know though, he must be\nanxious enough as it is... knowing what\nlies ahead.

Speaking of your parents,\nwere they alive, how do you think they\'d\nfeel? proud? or concerned that your\nattitude shows at best a pathological\nneed for attention, at worst a psychotic\ndeathwish.\n\nHARRY\n(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes\naren\'t glistening with the ghosts of\nmy past.\n\n\nINT.

Did you or did\nyou not put your name into the goblet\nof fire?\n\nHARRY\nNo!\n\nSIR\nShh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about\nthis dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail\nand Voldemort, but who was the third\nman in the room?\n\nHARRY\nI dunno.\n\nSIR\nYou didn\'t hear a name?\n\nHARRY\nNo. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a\njob to do. Something important.\n\nSIR\nWhat was that?\n\nHARRY\nHe wanted... me. I dunno why, but he\nwas gonna use this man to get to me.\nI mean it was only a dream right?\n\n\nSIR\nYes. It\'s just a dream. Look Harry,\nthe deatheaters at the world cup, your\nname rising from that goblet these are\nnot just coincidences. Hogwarts isn\'t\nsafe any more.\n\nHARRY\nWhat are you saying?\n\nSIR\nI\'m saying the devils are inside the\nwalls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater.\nAnd no one, no one stops being a deatheater.\nThen there\'s Barty Crouch, heart of\nstone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.\n\n\nHARRY\nDo you think one of them put my name\nin the goblet?\n\nSIR\nI haven\'t a clue who put your name in\nthat goblet Harry but whoever did it\nis no friend to you.

What\ndo you want me to say again?\n\nRon whispers some words to Hermione. It\'s clear Ron and Harry\nare not on speaking terms.\n\nHermione walks up to Harry.\n\nHERMIONE\nRonald would like me to tell you that\nSeamus told him that Dean was told by\nParvati that Hagrid was looking for\nyou.\n\nHARRY\nIs that right? Well.... what?\n\nHERMIONE\nUhhh...\n\nShe walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back.\n\nHERMIONE\nDean was told by Parvati that... Please\ndon\'t ask me say it again.

Poor\nRon nearly fainted just seeing him you\nknow.\n\nHARRY\nRon was here?\n\nHAGRID\nOh sure. His brother Charlie helped\nbring him over from Romania.

Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background\nwith the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other\npupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs\npast.\n\nBOY\nCedric rules!\n\nHARRY\nThanks.\n\nHarry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.\n\nBOY\nLike the badge?\n\nHARRY\nExcuse me..\n\nThey laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric\nwho is standing around with his friends. Cedric\'s friends hurl\noff more insults.\n\nHARRY\n(to Cedric) Can I have a word?\n\nCEDRIC\nAlright.\n\nThey walk away some distance.\n\nHARRY\nDragons. That\'s the first task. They\'ve\ngot one for each of us.\n\nCEDRIC\nAre you serious? And Fleur and Krum,\ndo they...?\n\nHARRY\nYes.\n\nCEDRIC\nRight.

I don\'t think you\'re\ngonna last ten minutes in this tournament.\nHe disagrees. He thinks you won\'t last\nFIVE.\n\nHARRY\nI don\'t give a damn what you or your\nfather thinks Malfoy. He\'s vile and\ncruel, and you\'re just pathetic.\n\nHarry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye\nappears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.\n\nMAD-EYE\nI\'ll teach you to cast when someone\'s\nback is turned.\n\nMCGONAGALL\nProfessor Moody what are you doing?\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nTeaching.\n\nMCGONAGALL\nIs that a student?\n\nMAD-EYE\nTechnically it\'s a ferret.\n\nMad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the\ntrouser leg of one of Draco\'s friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.\nEveryone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.\nEventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back\nto normal.\n\nDRACO\nMy father will hear about this!\n\nMAD-EYE\nIs that a threat!\n\nDraco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.\n\nMAD-EYE\nI could tell you stories about your\nfather that would curl even your greasy\nhair boy! It doesn\'t end here!\n\nMCGONAGALL\nWe never use transfigration as a punishment,\nsurely Dumbledore told you that.\n\nMAD-EYE\nHe might\'ve mentioned it.\n\nMCGONAGALL\nWell you will do well to remember it.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\n(To Harry) come with me.\n\n\nINT.

You wouldn\'t believe it if\nI did. Now... what are you going to\ndo about your dragon?\n\nHARRY\nOh... um... You know I just thought\nI\'d...\n\nMAD-EYE\nSit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,\nby your age he could take a whistle\ninto a watch and have it sing you the\ntime. Miss Delacour, she\'s as much a\nfairy princess as I am. As for Krum,\nhis head may be filled with sawdust\nbut Karkaroff\'s is NOT. They\'ll have\na strategy, and you can bet that it\'ll\nplay to Krum\'s strengths. Hmm? Come\non Potter. What are your strengths?\n\n\nHARRY\nUm... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I\'m\na fair flyer.\n\nMAD-EYE\nBetter than fair the way I heard it.\n\n\nHARRY\nBut I\'m not allowed a broom.\n\nMAD-EYE\nYou\'re allowed a wand.\n\n\nEXT.

It\'s one thing for a bloke\nto show up alone. For a girl it\'s just\nsad.\n\nHERMIONE\nI won\'t be going alone because believe\nit or not someone\'s asked me. And I\nsaid yes.\n\nRON\nBloody hell.\n\nHermione storms off.\n\nRON\nLook. We\'ve just got to grit our teeth\nand do it. Tonight when we get back\nto the common room, we\'ll both have\npartners. Agreed?\n\nHARRY\nAgreed.\n\n\nEXT. HOGWARTS - SNOWY\n\nHarry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps\ninto Cho who has come around the corner.\n\nCHO\nHarry!\n\nHARRY\nCho!\n\nCHO\nWatch yourself on the stairs, it\'s a\nbit icey at the top.\n\nHARRY\nOk thanks. Cho?\n\nCHO\nYes?\n\nHARRY\nUm. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe\nyou wanted to go to the ball with me?\n\n\nCHO\nSorry? I didn\'t catch that.\n\nHARRY\nUm. I was just wondering if maybe you\nwanted to go to the ball with me.\n\n\nCHO\nOh. Um. Harry I\'m sorry but someone\'s\nalready asked me. And well I\'ve said\nI\'ll go with him.\n\nHARRY\nOk. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.\n\n\nCHO\nHarry I really am sorry.\n\n\nINT. COMMON ROOM\n\nRon is being helped into the room, he looks shaky.\n\nHARRY\nWhat happened to you?\n\nGIRL\nHe just asked Fleur Delacour out.\n\nHERMIONE\nWhat?\n\nHARRY\nWhat did she say?\n\nHERMIONE\nNo of course.\n\nRon shakes his head.\n\nHERMIONE\nShe said yes??\n\nHARRY\nDon\'t be silly.\n\nRON\nThere she was walking by. You know I\nlike it when they walk. I couldn\'t help\nit, it just sort of slipped out.\n\nGIRL\nActually he sort of screamed at her,\nit was a bit frightening.\n\nHARRY\nWhat did you do then?\n\nRON\nWhat else? I ran for it. I\'m not cut\nout for this Harry. I don\'t know what\ngot into me.\n\nThe Patil twins walk past.\n\nPATILS\nHi Harry.\n\nHARRY\nHey!\n\n\nINT. DANCEHALL\n\nSoft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the\nhall.\n\n\nELSEWHERE\n\nRon is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced\nand uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.\n\nRON\nBloody hell.\n\nHarry walks in, he\'s dressed in a more conventional suit.\n\nRON\nWhat are those??\n\nHARRY\nMy dress robes.\n\nRON\nWell they\'re alright. No lace, no dodgy\nlittle collar.\n\nHARRY\nWell I expect yours are more traditional.\n\n\nRON\nTraditional?? They\'re ancient! I look\nlike my great aunt Tessie.\n\nHe sniffs at his clothes.\n\nRON\nI smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder\nme Harry.\n\n\nINT. DANCEHALL\n\nHarry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron\nis fidgeting with his outfit.\n\nHARRY\nLeave it alone.\n\nRON\nPoor kid, bet she\'s alone in her room\ncrying her eyes out.\n\nHARRY\nWho?\n\nRON\nHermione of course. Come on Harry, why\'d\nyou think she wouldn\'t tell us who she\'s\ncoming with?\n\nHARRY\nBecause we\'d take the mickey out of\nher if she did.\n\nRON\nBecause nobody asked her. I would have\ntaken her myself if she weren\'t so bleeding\nproud.\n\nThe boys approach the Patil twins.\n\nPARVATI\nHello boys. Don\'t you look...\n\nShe looks at Ron.\n\nPARVATI\n... dashing.\n\nMCGONAGALL\nHere you are Potter. Are you and Miss\nPatil ready?\n\nHARRY\nReady professor?\n\nMCGONAGALL\nTo dance. It\'s traditional that the\nthree champions or in this case four\nare the first to dance. Surely I told\nyou that.\n\nHARRY\nNo.\n\nMCGONAGALL\nOh well now you know. Oh, as for your\nMr Weasly you may proceed into the great\nhall with Miss Patil.\n\nHermione enters the room all dressed up.\n\nPARVATI\nShe looks beautiful.\n\nHARRY\nYeah she does.\n\nHermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and\nthey walk together.\n\nPADMA\n(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With\nViktor Krum??\n\nRON\nNo. Absolutely not.\n\nLoud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with\ntheir partners.\n\nPARVATI\nHarry. Take my waist.\n\nHARRY\nWhat?\n\nPARVATI\nNow.\n\nThey dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall,\nMr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits\non the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now\nrock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from\nPulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates\nare sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes\nup after a great time with Viktor.\n\nHERMIONE\nHot isn\'t it? Viktor\'s gone to get drinks.\nCare to join us?\n\nRON\nNo, we\'d NOT care to join you and Viktor.\n\n\nHERMIONE\nWhat\'s got your wand in a knot?\n\nRON\nHe\'s a Durmstrang. You\'re fraternising\nwith the enemy.\n\nHERMIONE\nThe enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?\nBesides, the whole point of the tournament\nis international magical cooperation,\nto make friends.\n\nRON\nHrmph, I think he\'s got a bit more than\nfriendship on his mind.\n\nHermione walks off.\n\nPADMA\nAre you going to ask me to dance or\nnot?\n\nRON\nNo.\n\n\nLATER\n\nRON\n(To Hermione) He\'s using you.\n\nHERMIONE\nHow dare you! Besides I can take care\nof myself.\n\nRON\nDoubt it. He\'s way too old.\n\nHERMIONE\nWhat? What? That\'s what you think?\n\n\nRON\nYeah that is what I think.\n\nHERMIONE\nYou know the solution then don\'t you.\n\n\nRON\nGo on.\n\nHERMIONE\nNext time there\'s a ball pluck up the\ncourage and ask me before somebody else\ndoes, and not as a last resort.\n\nRON\nWell that\'s completely off the point.\nHarry...\n\nHarry walks up.\n\nHERMIONE\nWhere have you been? Nevermind! Off\nto bed both of you.\n\nHarry and Ron walk away.\n\nRON\nThey get scary when they get older.\n\n\nHERMIONE\nRon you spoil everything!\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\nNIGHTMARE SEQUENCE\n\nWe\'re back in the old house.\n\nVOLDERMORT\nLet me see it again.\n\nA sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on\nthe arm.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nAh yes, the time is close now. Harry!\nAt last! Step aside Wormtail so I can\ngive our guest a proper greeting!\n\n\nHarry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking\nup to his bed. It\'s Neville.\n\nNEVILLE\nYou alright Harry? I just got in. Me!\n\n\nHe chuckles and dances off.\n\n\nEXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry you told me you\'d figured the\negg out weeks ago. The task is two days\nfrom now.\n\nHARRY\nReally? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor\'s\nalready figured it out.\n\nHERMIONE\nI wouldn\'t know, we didn\'t actually\ntalk about the tournament. Actually\nwe didn\'t really talk at all, Viktor\'s\nmore of a physical being. I just mean\nhe\'s not particularly... Mostly he watches\nme study. It\'s a bit annoying actually.\nYou are trying to figure this egg out\naren\'t you?\n\nHARRY\nWhat\'s that supposed to mean?\n\nHERMIONE\nI mean these tasks are supposed to test\nyou, in the most brutal way they\'re\nalmost cruel. And um, I\'m scared for\nyou. You got by the dragon mostly on\nnerve, I\'m not sure it\'s going to be\nenough this time.\n\nCEDRIC\nHey Potter.\n\nHARRY\nCedric.\n\nCEDRIC\nHow are you?\n\nHARRY\nSpectacular.\n\nCEDRIC\nLook I realise I never really thanked\nyou properly for tipping me off about\nthose dragons.\n\nHARRY\nForget about it. I\'m sure you would\nhave done the same for me.\n\nCEDRIC\nExactly. You know the prefects bathroom\non the fifth floor?\n\nHarry nods.\n\nCEDRIC\nIt\'s not a bad place for a bath. Just\ntake your egg and mull things over in\nthe hot water.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\nHarry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has\nhis golden egg on the side.\n\nHARRY\nI must be out of my mind.\n\nHe opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.\n\nMYRTLE\nI\'d try putting it in the water if I\nwere you.\n\nHARRY\nMyrtle!\n\nMYRTLE\nLong time no see.\n\nThe ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.\n\nMYRTLE\nI was circling a blocked drain the other\nday and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice\npotion. Not being a bad boy again are\nyou Harry?\n\nHARRY\nPolyjuice potion! Kicked the habit.\nMyrtle, did you say try putting it in\nthe water?\n\nMyrtle flies around again and gets in the water.\n\nMYRTLE\nWell. That\'s what he did. The other\nboy, the handsome one. Cedric.\n\nHarry takes the egg and puts it under the water.\n\nMYRTLE\nWell go on, open it.\n\nHarry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.\n\n\nVOICE SINGING\nCome seek us where our voices sound.\nWe cannot sing above the ground. An\nhour long you\'ll have to look, to recover\nwhat we took.\n\nHARRY\nMyrtle, there aren\'t Merpeople in the\nblack lake are there?\n\nMYRTLE\nAhhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to\nriddle it out. Almost all the bubbles\nwere gone...\n\nMyrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.\n\n\nINT. COMMON ROOM\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry, tell me again.\n\nHARRY\nCome seek us where our voices sound.\n\n\nHERMIONE\nThe black lake, that\'s obvious.\n\nHARRY\nAn hour long you\'ll have to look.\n\nHERMIONE\nAgain obvious, though I must admit potentially\nproblematic\n\nHARRY\nPotentially problematic? When was the\nlast time you held your breath under\nthe water for an hour Hermione?\n\nHERMIONE\nLook Harry, we can do this. The three\nof us can figure it out.\n\nMad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.\n\nMAD-EYE\nHate to break up this scholar session\nbut Professor McGonagall would like\nto see you in her office. Not you Potter,\njust Weasly and Granger.\n\nHERMIONE\nBut sir, the second task is only hours\naway and...\n\nMAD-EYE\nExactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared\nby now and could do with a good night\'s\nsleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!\n\nNeville appears from behind a bookcase.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWhy don\'t you help Potter put his books\nback.\n\nNEVILLE\nYou know, if you\'re interested in plants\nyou\'d be better with Gorshok\'s Guide\nto Herbology. Do you know there\'s a\nwizard in Nepal whose growing gravity\nresistant trees?\n\nHARRY\nNeville. No offense, but I really don\'t\ncare about plants. Now if there\'s a\nTibetan turnip that will allow me to\nbreathe underwater for an hour then\ngreat.\n\nNEVILLE\nI don\'t know about a turnip but you\ncan always use gilliweed.\n\n\nEXT. LAKESIDE\n\nThe Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking\nalong with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand.\n\n\nHARRY\nYou\'re sure about this Neville.\n\nNEVILLE\nAbsolutely.\n\nHARRY\nFor an hour.\n\nNEVILLE\nMost likely.\n\nHARRY\nMost likely?\n\nNEVILLE\nWell there is some debate among herbologists\nas to the effects of freshwater versus\nsaltwater.\n\nHARRY\nYou\'re telling me this now? You must\nbe joking.\n\nNEVILLE\nI just wanted to help.\n\nHARRY\nWell that makes you sight better than\nRon and Hermione. Where are they anyway?\n\n\nNEVILLE\nYou seem a little tense Harry.\n\nHARRY\nDo I?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the\nsecond task. Last night something was\nstolen from each of our champions. A\ntreasure of sorts. These four treasures,\none for each champion, now lie on the\nbottom of the black lake. In order to\nwin each champion need only find their\ntreasure and return to the surface.\nSimple enough. Except for this, they\nwill have one hour to do so and one\nhour only. After that they\'ll be on\ntheir own.\n\nMAD-EYE\n(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.\n\n\nHarry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Continued) You may begin at the start\nof the cannon.\n\nThe cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of\nthem dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of\ngilliweed take hold, Harry\'s hands and feet become webbed.\n\n\n\nEXT. ABOVE WATER\n\nSEAMUS\nWhat\'s the matter with him?\n\nFRIEND\nI don\'t know I can\'t see him.\n\nNEVILLE\nOh my god I\'ve killed Harry Potter!\n\n\nHarry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer.\n\n\n\nEXT. UNDERWATER\n\nHarry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing.\nWe see Fleur get trapped, she screams.\n\n\nEXT. ABOVE WATER\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons\nchampion Miss Delacour has unfortunately\nbeen forced to retire. She will take\nno further part in this task.\n\n\nEXT. UNDERWATER\n\nHarry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He\nfinds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons\ntied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho\nwith him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious\nmerpeople appear.\n\nHARRY\nBut she\'s my friend too!\n\nMERPERSON\nOnly one.\n\nWhat looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that\nit has legs and it\'s Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for\nthe surface. Harry frees Ron.\n\n\nEXT. ABOVE WATER\n\nCedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione\nnext, the crows chants \'Krum, Krum, Krum\'. The Beauxbatons girls\nlook worried.\n\n\nEXT. UNDERWATER\n\nHarry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable\nto rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the\nsurface with the both of them. He\'s attacked and gets held down,\nhe pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.\n\n\nEXT. ABOVE WATER\n\nRon and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They\'re\nhelped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater\nHarry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he\nflies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry!\n\nBARTY\nGet him another towel.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI want all the judges over here now.\n\n\nFLEUR\n(To Harry) You saved her, even though\nshe wasn\'t yours to save. My little\nsister!\n\nFleur kisses Harry on the face.\n\nFLEUR\nThank you! And you... (Looks to Ron).\nYou helped!\n\nRON\nWell... yeah... a bit\n\nFleur kisses him too.\n\nRON\nMerci.\n\nHermione comes up to Harry with a towel.\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry!\n\nHARRY\nHermione\n\nHERMIONE\nAre you alright? You must be freezing!\nPersonally I think you behaved admirably.\n\n\nHermione kisses Harry on the head.\n\nHARRY\nI finished last Hermione.\n\nHERMIONE\nNext to last.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nAttention! Attention! The winner is...\nMr Diggory!\n\nCedric and his friends cheer.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nFor showing unique command of the bubblehead\nshark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would\nhave finished first had it not been\nfor his determination to rescue not\nonly Mr Weasly but the others as well.\nWe\'ve agreed to award him second place!\nFor outstanding moral fibre.\n\n\nAs they\'re walking away from the lake Harry\'s friends are cheering\nhim.\n\nFRED\nAll that moral fibre eh?\n\nRON\nBlimey even when you go wrong it turns\nout right.\n\nGEORGE\nWell done \'moral fibre\'.\n\n\nBarty Crouch is waiting for Harry.\n\nBARTY\nCongratulations Potter, fine achievement.\nWell done boy. I\'m sorry we haven\'t\nspoken, after all your story is one\nI\'ve heard many times. Quite remarkable.\nTragic of course, to lose one\'s family.\nNever whole again are we? Still, life\ngoes on. And here we stand. I\'m sure\nyour parents would be very proud today\nPotter.\n\nMad-Eye approaches them.\n\nMAD-EYE\nBartimus! Not trying to lure Potter\ninto one of the ministry\'s summer internships\nare we? Last boy who went into the department\nof ministries never came out!\n\nBarty walks away from him.\n\nMAD-EYE\nAnd they say I\'m mad.\n\n\nEXT. DARK FOREST\n\nHAGRID\nSo I remember, I remember when I first\nmet you all. Biggest bunch of misfits\nI\'ve ever set eyes on. Always reminded\nme of myself a little. And here we all\nare, four years later.\n\nRON\nWe\'re still misfits.\n\nHAGRID\nMaybe. But we\'ve all got each other,\nand Harry of course. Soon to be! The\nyoungest! Tri-Wizard champion there\'s\never been! Hooray!\n\nThey walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head\nin pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless.\n\n\nHARRY\nMr Crouch?\n\n\nINT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nA man has died here. And he won\'t be\nthe last, you must take action.\n\nFUDGE\nI will not. In times like these the\nwizard world looks to its leaders for\nstrength Dumbledore.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThen for once show them some.\n\nFUDGE\nThe tri-wizard tournament will not be\ncancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nBut surely that is what\'s right, no\nmatter what others think.\n\nFUDGE\nWhat did you say? What did you say to\nme?\n\nMAD-EYE\nExcuse me gentlemen, it may interest\nyou to know that this conversation is\nno longer private.\n\nMad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.\n\nFUDGE\nHarry! Harry how good to see you again.\n\n\nHARRY\nI can come back later Professor.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nOh not necessary Harry the minister\nand I are done. I\'ll be back in a moment.\nMinister, after you. Harry do feel free\nto indulge in a liquorice snack in my\nabsence, but I have to warn you they\'re\na little bit sharp.\n\nHarry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl\nand takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips\nat his hand.\n\nHARRY\nAgh!\n\nA compartment in the wall opens, there\'s a glowing blue pool\nof water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time\nand place. It\'s a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore\nis seated next to where Harry is.\n\n\nINT. COURTROOM\n\nHARRY\nProfessor?\n\nThe man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.\n\nMAN\nProfessor.\n\nDumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through\nHarry\'s body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence.\nProceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.\n\n\nBARTY\nIgor Karkaroff, you have been brought\nfrom Azkaban at your own request to\npresent evidence to this counsel. Should\nyour testimony prove consequential.\nCounsel may be prepared to order your\nimmediate release. Until such time you\nremain in the eyes of the ministry a\nconvicted deatheater. Do you accept\nthese terms?\n\nIGOR\nI do sir.\n\nBARTY\nWhat do you wish to present?\n\nIGOR\nI have names sir. There was a Rosier,\nEvan Rosier.\n\nBARTY\nMr Rosier is dead.\n\nIGOR\nDead?\n\nMAD-EYE\n(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of\nme with him though didn\'t he.\n\nMad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.\n\nIGOR\nI didn\'t know.\n\nBARTY\nIf that is all the witness has to offer...\n\n\nIGOR\nNo! No! There was Rookwood, he was a\nspy.\n\nBARTY\nAugustus Rookwood? Of the department\nof ministries.\n\nIGOR\nYa ya, the same. He passed information\nto you know who from inside the ministry\nitself.\n\nBARTY\nVery well. Counsel will deliberate.\nIn the meantime you will be returned\nto Azkaban.\n\nIGOR\nNO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,\nSeverus Snape.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe counsel is very much aware you have\ngiven evidence on this matter. Severus\nSnape was indeed a deatheater and prior\nto Lord Voldemort\'s downfall turned\nspy for us at great personal risk. Today\nhe\'s no more a deatheater than I am.\n\n\nIgor protests loudly.\n\nIGOR\nIt\'s a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful\nto the dark lord.\n\nBARTY\nSilence!\n\nBarty hits the gavel repeatedly.\n\nBARTY\nUnless the witness possesses any name\nof genuine consequence this session\nis now concluded.\n\nIGOR\nOh no no no no no. I heard about one\nmore.\n\nBARTY\nWhat\'s that?\n\nIGOR\nThe name...\n\nBARTY\nYes?\n\nIGOR\nI know for a fact this person took part\nin the capture, and by means of the\ncruciatus curse, torture of the aurer\nFrank Longbottom and...\n\nBARTY\nThe name! Give me the wretched name!\n\n\nIGOR\nBarty Crouch! ... Junior.\n\nBarty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,\nhe falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.\nGuards seize Barty junior.\n\nBARTY JR\nGet your hands off me you pathetic little\nmen. Hello father.\n\nBARTY\nYou are no son of mine.\n\nBARTY JR\nGAHHHH!\n\nHarry steps out of the blue pool and we\'re back in the darkened\nroom.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nCuriosity\'s not a sin Harry, but you\nshould exercise caution. It\'s a pensieve,\nuseful if like me you find your mind\na wee bit stretched. It allows me to\nsee what small things I\'ve already seen.\nYou see Harry I\'ve searched and searched\nfor something, some small detail. Something\nI might have overlooked, something that\nwould explain why these terrible things\nhave happened. Every time I get close\nto an answer it slips away, it\'s maddedning.\n\n\nHARRY\nSir, Mr Crouch\'s son, what happened\nto him?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHe was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty\nto do it. But he had no choice, the\nevidence was overwhelming. Why do you\nask?\n\nHARRY\nIt\'s just that I had a dream about him.\nIt was in the summer, before school.\nIn the dream I was in a house and Voldemort\nwas there only he wasn\'t quite human,\nand Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch\'s\nson.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHave there been other dreams like this?\n\n\nHARRY\nYes. Always the same one. Sir... these\ndreams, what I see, you don\'t think\nit\'s actually happening do you?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI think it\'s unwise for you to linger\nover these dreams Harry, I think it\'s\nbest that you simply...\n\nDumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic\nout from his head.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nCast them away.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR\n\nHarry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the\nherbs store.\n\nIGOR\nIt\'s a sign Severus, you know what it\nmeans as well as I.\n\nThe door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.\n\n\nSEVERUS\nPotter! What\'s your hurry? Congratulations,\nyour performance in the black lake was\ninspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?\n\n\nHARRY\nYes sir.\n\nSEVERUS\nIngenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,\nnot something found in your every day\ngarden. Nor is this, know what it is?\n\n\nHARRY\nBubble juice sir?\n\nSEVERUS\nVeritaserum. Three drops of this and\nyou-know-who himself will spill his\ndarkest secrets. The use of this on\na student is regrettably forbidden,\nhowever should you ever steal from my\npersonal stores again, my hand might\njust slip over your morning pumpkin\njuice.\n\nHARRY\nI haven\'t stolen anything.\n\nSEVERUS\nDon\'t lie to me. Gilliweed might be\ninnocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing\nflies? You and your friends are brewing\npolyjuice potion and believe me I\'m\ngoing to find out why.\n\nSeverus closes the door in Harry\'s face.\n\n\nEXT. ARENA\n\nMusic is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions\nemerge.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nEarlier today Professor Moody placed\nthe tri-wizards cup deep within the\nmaze. Only he knows its exact position.\nNow as Mr Diggory...\n\nThe crowd cheer on hearing his name.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first\nposition they will be the first to enter\nthe maze. Followed by Mr Krum...\n\nThe bulgarian crowd go nuts.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(continued) The first person to touch\nthe cup will be the winner. I\'ve instructed\nthe staff to patrol the perimeter, if\nat any point should a contestant wish\nto withdraw from the task he or she\nneed only send up red sparks with their\nwands. Contestants, gather round.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(To the contestants) In the maze you\'ll\nfind not dragons or creatures of the\ndeep. Instead you\'ll face something\nmore challenging. You see, people change\nin the maze. Oh find the cup if you\ncan, but be very weary you could just\nlose yourselves along the way.\n\nMAD-EYE\nChampions! Prepare yourselves.\n\nCedric hugs his father.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nOn the count of three... ONE...\n\nThe cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.\nHarry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.\nThe entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan\nout to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing\nthe maze, creature noises are all around.\n\nCedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on\nhim. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she\nis attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she\'s\nunconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being\nswallowed into the undergrowth.\n\nHARRY\nFleur? Fleur!\n\nHe\'s too late she\'s disappeared. He sends up a red spark into\nthe air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry\nruns. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves\ntowards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.\n\nCEDRIC\nGet down!\n\nHarry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up\nand kicks the wand out of Viktor\'s hand. He points his wand at\nViktor\'s body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.\n\n\nHARRY\nNo stop! He\'s bewitched Cedric.\n\nThey struggle.\n\nCEDRIC\nGet off me!\n\nHARRY\nHe\'s bewitched!\n\nThe two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth\ngrabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric\nis pinned down with no means of escape.\n\nCEDRIC\nHarry! Harry!\n\nHarry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps\nhim up.\n\nCEDRIC\nYou know for a moment there I thought\nyou were gonna let it get me.\n\nHARRY\nFor a moment so did I.\n\nCEDRIC\nSome game huh?\n\nHARRY\nSome game.\n\nThe wind starts blowing again.\n\nCEDRIC\nGo. Take it, you saved me!\n\nHARRY\nTogether, on three. One, two, three!\n\n\n\nEXT. GRAVEYARD\n\nHarry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard.\n\nCEDRIC\nYou ok?\n\nHARRY\nYeah, you?\n\nCEDRIC\nWhere are we?\n\nHARRY\nI\'ve been here before.\n\nCEDRIC\nIt\'s a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.\n\n\nHARRY\nI\'ve been here before in a dream. Cedric,\nwe have to get back to the cup? Now!\n\n\nCEDRIC\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nHarry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.\n\nCEDRIC\nWhat is it?\n\nHARRY\nGet back to the cup!\n\nWe see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.\n\nCEDRIC\nWho are you? What do you want?\n\nVOLDEMORT\nKill the spare.\n\nWormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.\n\nHARRY\nCedric!\n\nCedric lays dead on the ground.\n\nWormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and\ntraps him.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDo it, now!\n\nWormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on.\n\n\nWORMTAIL\nBones of the father, unwillingly given.\n\n\nA bone hovers in the air under Wormtail\'s control, he drops it\ninto the cauldron.\n\nWORMTAIL\nFlesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.\n\n\nHe takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.\n\nWORMTAIL\nBlood of the enemy forcibly taken.\n\n\nHe takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.\nWormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops\nfall into it.\n\nWORMTAIL\nThe dark lord shall rise again.\n\nThe cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nMy wand Wormtail.\n\nWormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nHold out your arm.\n\nWORMTAIL\nMaster. Thank you master.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThe other arm Wormtail.\n\nWormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks\nthe wand into Wormtail\'s arm. The sky changes, others have been\nsummoned.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nWelcome my friends. Thirty years it\'s\nbeen, and yet you stand before me as\nthough it were only yesterday. I confess\nmyself disappointed, not one of you\ntried to find me.\n\nVoldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nNot even you, Lucius.\n\nLUCIUS\nMy lord. Had I detected any sign or\neven a whisper of your whereabouts.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThere were signs my friend, and more\nthan whispers.\n\nLUCIUS\nI assure you I never renounced the old\nways. The face I have been obliged to\npresent each day since your absence,\nthat was my true mask.\n\nWORMTAIL\nI returned.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nOut of fear, not loyalty. Still you\nhave proved yourself useful these past\nfew months Wormtail.\n\nVoldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.\n\nWORMTAIL\nThank you master, thank you.\n\nVOLDEMORT\n(To Cedric\'s corpse) Oh, such a handsome\nboy.\n\nHARRY\nDon\'t touch him.\n\nHarry struggles to get free.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nHarry! I\'d almost forgotten you were\nhere. Standing on the bones of my father.\nI\'d introduce you but word has it you\'re\nalmost as famous as me these days. The\nboy who lived. How lies have fed your\nlegend Harry. Shall I reveal what really\nhappened that night thirteen years ago?\nShall I divulge how I truly lost my\npowers? It was love. You see when dear\nsweet Lily Potter gave her life for\nher only son she provided the ultimate\nprotection. I could not touch you. It\nwas old magic, something I should have\nforseen. But no matter, no matter. Things\nhave changed, I can touch you now!\n\n\nVoldemort puts his hand on Harry\'s head and he screams.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nAstonishing what a few drops of your\nblood will do eh Harry? Pick up your\nwand Potter. I said pick it up, get\nup. Get up! You\'ve been taught how to\nduel I presume yes? First we bow to\neach other. Come on now Harry the niceties\nmust be observed, Dumbledore would not\nwant you to forget your manners now\nwould he? I said bow!\n\nVoldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThat\'s better. And now...\n\nVoldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nAtta boy Harry, your parents would be\nproud. Especially your filthy mongrel\nmother. I\'m going to kill you Harry\nPotter, I\'m going to destroy you. After\ntonight no one will ever again question\nmy powers. After tonight if they speak\nof you they\'ll speak only of how you\nbegged for death, and I being a merciful\nlord obliged. Get up.\n\nVoldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDon\'t you turn your back on me Harry\nPotter I want you to look at me when\nI kill you, I want to see the lights\nleave your eyes.\n\nHarry takes steps toward Voldemort.\n\nHARRY\nHave it your way.\n\nThey both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDo nothing. He is mine to finish. He\'s\nmine!\n\nShapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore\'s\nvoice.\n\nHARRY\'S DAD\n(voice) Harry when the connection is\nbroken you must get to the portkey.\nWe can delay it for a moment to give\nyou time but only a moment, do you understand?\n\n\nCEDRIC\n(voice) Harry take my body back will\nyou? Take my body back to my father.\n\n\nHARRY\'S MOTHER\n(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you\'re ready.\nLet go! Let go!\n\nThe connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric\'s body and summons\nthe cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks\nangry.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nNo!\n\n\nEXT. ARENA\n\nBack at the arena Harry appears with Cedric\'s body. The crowd\ndon\'t understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant\nmusic starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric\'s body.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry! Harry!\n\nDumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric\'s body.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nTell me what happened!\n\nHARRY\nHe\'s back, he\'s back! Voldemort\'s back.\nCedric, he asked me to bring his body\nback. I couldn\'t leave him, not there.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nIt\'s alright Harry. It\'s alright, he\'s\nhome, you both are.\n\nFUDGE\nKeep everybody in their seats. A boy\nhas just been killed. The body must\nbe moved Dumbledore, there are... too\nmany people.\n\nAMOS\nLet me through! That\'s my son! My boy!\n\n\nAmos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.\n\n\nINT. DARKENED ROOM\n\nMad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is\nin the room still sobbing. They sit.\n\nMAD-EYE\nAre you alright Potter?\n\nHarry nods.\n\nMAD-EYE\nDoes it hurt?\n\nHARRY\nNot so much now.\n\nMAD-EYE\nI\'d better take a look at it.\n\nWe see Harry\'s arm, it has a skull and snake marking.\n\nHARRY\nThe cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched\nit.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWhat was it like? What was he like?\n\n\nHARRY\nWho?\n\nMAD-EYE\nThe dark lord. What was it like to stand\nin his presence?\n\nHARRY\nI dunno. It was like I\'d fallen into\none of my dreams. One of my nightmares.\n\n\nMad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for\nhis bottle but it\'s empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles\nand struggles to find one.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWere there others? In the graveyard,\nwere there others?\n\nHARRY\nUm. I don\'t think I said anything about\na graveyard Professor.\n\nMAD-EYE\nMarvellous creatures dragons aren\'t\nthey? Do you think that miserable oaf\nwould have led you into the woods if\nI hadn\'t suggested it? Do you think\nCedric Diggory would have told you to\nhold the egg under the water if I hadn\'t\nhave told him first myself? Do you think\nNeville Longbottom the witless wonder\ncould have provided you with gilliweed\nif I hadn\'t have given him the book\nthat led you straight to it? Huh??\n\n\nHARRY\nIt was you from the beginning. You put\nmy name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched\nKrum. But...\n\nMad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.\n\nMAD-EYE\nYou won because I made it so Potter.\nYou ended up in that graveyard tonight\nbecause it was meant to be so. And now\nthe deed is done. The blood that runs\nthrough these veins runs within the\ndark lord. Imagine how he will reward\nme when he learns that I have once and\nfor all silenced the great Harry Potter.\n\n\nA flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.\nDumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye\nby the neck...\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSeverus...\n\nSeverus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nDo you know who I am?\n\nMAD-EYE\nAlbus Dumbledore.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nAre you Alastor Moody? Are ya?\n\nMAD-EYE\nNo.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nIs he in this room? Is he in this room?\n\n\nWe see a nod.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry get away from there!\n\nDumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains\na series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see\nthat there\'s a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nAre you alright Alastor?\n\nALASTOR\nI\'m sorry Albus.\n\nHARRY\nThat\'s Moody, but then who\'s...?\n\nDumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye\'s Bottles.\n\nSEVERUS\nPolyjuice potion.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nNow we know who\'s been stealing it from\nyour store Severus.\n\nDumbledore looks into the pit.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nWe\'ll get you up in a minute.\n\nAlastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in\na chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.\nHe appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece\nwhich falls on the floor, we see that he\'s transformed into Barty\nCrouch Junior.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nBarty Crouch Junior.\n\nBARTY JR\nI\'ll show you mine if you show me yours.\n\n\nBarty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nYour arm Harry.\n\nBARTY JR\nYou know what this means don\'t you?\nHe\'s back. Lord Voldemort has returned.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSend an owl to Azkaban, think they\'ll\nfind they\'re missing a prisoner.\n\n\nBARTY JR\nI\'ll be welcomed back like a hero.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nPerhaps. Personally I\'ve never had much\ntime for heroes.\n\n\nINT. ASSEMBLY ROOM\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge\na really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory\nwas as you all know, exceptionally hard\nworking, intricately fair minded. And\nmost importantly a fierce fierce friend.\nI think therefore you have the right\nto know exactly how he died. You see,\nCedric Diggory was murdered by Lord\nVoldemort. The ministry of magic does\nnot wish me to tell you this. But not\nto do so I think would be an insult\nto his memory. Now the pain we all feel\nat this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds\nus that while we may come from different\nplaces and speak in different tongues,\nour hearts beat as one. In light of\nrecent events the bonds of friendship\nwe made this year will be more important\nthan ever. Remember that and Cedric\nDiggory will not have died in vain,\nyou remember that. And we\'ll celebrate\na boy who was kind and honest and brave\nand true right to the very end.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\nHarry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI never liked these curtains. Set them\non fire in my fourth year, by accident\nof course. I put you in terrible danger\nthis year Harry I\'m sorry.\n\nHARRY\nProfessor, when I was in the graveyard\nthere was a moment... um... when Voldemort\'s\nwand and mine sort of connected.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nPriori Incantatem. You saw your parents\nthat night didn\'t you? They reappeared.\n\n\nHarry nods.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nNo spell can reawaken the dead Harry\nI trust you know that. Dark and diffiult\ntimes lie ahead. Soon we must all face\nthe choice between what is right what\nis easy. But remember this, you have\nfriends here. You\'re not alone.\n\n\nEXT. HOGWARTS\n\nThere\'s a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor\nKrum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.\n\nVIKTOR\nWrite to me. Promise.\n\nHERMIONE\nBye.\n\nRon is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both\nin turn give him a kiss on the head.\n\nFLEUR\nAu revoir Ron.\n\nThe Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The\nDurmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.\n\nRON\nDo you think we\'ll ever just have a\nquiet year at Hogwarts?\n\nHERMIONE\nNo.\n\nHARRY\nNo I don\'t think so.\n\nHERMIONE\nEverything\'s going to change now isn\'t\nit?\n\nHARRY\nYes.\n\nHERMIONE\nPromise you\'ll write this summer. Both\nof you.\n\nRON\nWell I won\'t. You know I won\'t!\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry will won\'t you?\n\nHARRY\nYeah. Every week.\n\nThey look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage\nhead off into the distance. The Bulgarians\' ship goes underwater.\n\n\n\nFADE OUT.', u'http://genius.com/Steven-kloves-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-script-annotated'], 387797: [u"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: (Ch. 2) The Vanishing Glass by\xa0J.K.\xa0Rowling", u"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: (Ch. 2) The Vanishing Glass Lyrics\n\nThe Vanishing GlassNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday \u2014 how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise \u2014 unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions \u2014 that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way \u2014 all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \u2014 Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n\u201cThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty-seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.  Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\u201d\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty\u2026 thirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there \u2014 or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s-her-name, your friend \u2014 Yvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026 and leave him in the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying \u2014 it had been years since he\u2019d really cried \u2014 but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 want\u2026 him\u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang \u2014 \u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically \u2014 and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy \u2014 any funny business, anything at all \u2014 and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n\u201c\u2026 roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon \u2014 they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can \u2014 but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself \u2014 no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see \u2014 so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T\nBELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened \u2014 one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo \u2014 cupboard \u2014 stay \u2014 no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.", u'http://genius.com/Jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-ch-2-the-vanishing-glass-annotated'], 2270198: [u'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: (Epilogue) Nineteen Years Later by\xa0J.K.\xa0Rowling', u'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: (Epilogue) Nineteen Years Later Lyrics\n\nAutumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father\'s arm.\n"It won\'t be long, and you\'ll be going too," Harry told her.\n"Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!"\nThe commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus\'s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.\n"I won\'t! I won\'t be a Slytherin!"\n"James, give it a rest!" said Ginny.\n"I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There\'s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin"\nBut James caught his mother\'s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.\n"You\'ll write to me, won\'t you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.\n"Every day, if you want us to," said Ginny.\n"Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters from home about once a month."\n"We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.\n"And you don\'t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother."\nSide by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was\npouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.\n"Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.\n"We\'ll find them," said Ginny reassuringly.\nBut the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody\'s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .\n"I think that\'s them, Al," said Ginny suddenly.\nA group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.\n"Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.\nRose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.\n"Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn\'t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I\'d have to Confound the examiner."\n"No, I didn\'t," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you."\n"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus\'s trunk and owl onto the train.\n"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror,\nand let\'s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that."\nBack on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose\'s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.\n"If you\'re not in Gryffindor, we\'ll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure."\n"Ron!"\nLily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.\n"He doesn\'t mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry\'s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.\n"Look who it is."\nDraco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son,  a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.\n"So that\'s little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother\'s brains."\n"Ron, for heaven\'s sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don\'t try to turn them against each other before they\'ve even started school!"\n"You\'re right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don\'t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood."\n"Hey!"\nJames had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.\n"Teddy\'s back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam.\n"Just seen him! And guess what he\'s doing? Snogging\nVictoire!"\nHe gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.\n"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy\nwhat he was doing --"\n"You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron --"\n"-- and he said he\'d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He\'s snogging her!" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.\n"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be part of the family then!"\n"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don\'t we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?"\n"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don\'t mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!"\n"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished."\nHe checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett\'s.\n"It\'s nearly eleven, you\'d better get on board."\n"Don\'t forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.\n"Mum! I can\'t give a professor love!"\n"But you know Neville--"\nJames rolled his eyes.\n"Outside, yeah, but at school he\'s Professor Longbottom, isn\'t he? I can\'t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . ."\nShaking his head at his mother\'s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.\n"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals."\n"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!"\nbut James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.\n"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They\'re gentle things, there\'s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won\'t be going up to school in the\ncarriages, you\'ll be going in the boats."\nGinny kissed Albus good-bye.\n"See you at Christmas."\n"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don\'t forget Hagrid\'s invited you to tea next Friday. Don\'t mess with Peeves. Don\'t duel anyone till you\'ve learned how. And don\'t let James wind you up."\n"What if I\'m in Slytherin?"\nThe whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.\nHarry crouched down so that Albus\'s face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry\'s three children, Albus had inherited Lily\'s eyes.\n"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."\n"But just say--"\n"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won\'t it? It doesn\'t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you\'ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."\n"Really?"\n"It did for me," said Harry.\nHe had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus\'s face when he said it. But how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.\n"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students.\n"Don\'t let it worry you," said Ron. "It\'s me, I\'m extremely famous."\nAlbus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son\'s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide\naway from him. . . .\nThe last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry\'s hand was still raised in farewell.\n"He\'ll be alright," murmured Ginny.\nAs Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.\n"I know he will."\nThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years.
