that the severe cold of the season was becoming rapidly less dangerous as they threaded the different mazes through the snow-banks that led to their respective dwellings. Then driving clouds began toward morning to flit across the heavens, and the moon set behind a volume of vapor that was impelled furiously toward the north, carrying with it the softer atmosphere from the distant ocean. The rising sun was obscured by denser and increasing columns of clouds, while the southerly wind that rushed up the valley brought the never-failing symptoms of a thaw.\n\nIt was quite late in the morning before Elizabeth, observing the faint glow which appeared on the eastern mountain long after the light of the sun had struck the opposite hills, ventured from the house, with a view to gratify her curiosity with a glance by daylight at the surrounding objects before the tardy revellers of the Christmas eve should make their appearance at the breakfast-table. While she was drawing the folds of her pelisse more closely around her form, to guard against a cold that was yet great though rapidly yielding, in the small inclosure that opened in the rear of the house on a little thicket of low pines that were springing up where trees of a mightier growth had lately stood, she was surprised at the voice of Mr. Jones.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you, Cousin Bess,\" he shouted. \"Ah, ha! an early riser, I see; but I knew I should steal a march on you. I never was in a house yet where I didn't get the first Christmas greeting on every soul in it, man, woman, and child\u2014great and small\u2014black, white, and yellow. But stop a minute till I can just slip on my coat. You are about to look at the improvements, I see, which no one can explain so well as I, who planned them all. It will be an hour before 'Duke and the Major can sleep off Mrs. Hollister's confounded distillations, and so I'll come down and go with you.\"\n\nElizabeth turned and observed her cousin in his night cap, with his head out of his bedroom window, where his zeal for pre-eminence, in defiance of the weather, had impelled him to thrust it. She laughed, and promising to wait for his company re-entered the house, making her appearance again, holding in her hand a packet that was secured by several large and important seals, just in time to meet the gentleman.\n\"Come, Bessy, come,\" he cried, drawing one of her arms through his own; \"the snow begins to give, but it will bear us yet. Don't you snuff old Pennsylvania in the very air? This is a vile climate, girl; now at sunset, last evening, it was cold enough to freeze a man's zeal, and that, I can tell you, takes a thermometer near zero for me; then about nine or ten it began to moderate; at twelve it was quite mild, and here all the rest of the night I have been so hot as not to bear a blanket on the bed.\u2014Holla! Aggy\u2014merry Christmas, Aggy\u2014I say, do you hear me, you black dog! there's a dollar for you; and if the gentle men get up before I come back, do you come out and let me know. I wouldn't have 'Duke get the start of me for the worth of your head.\"\n\nThe black caught the money from the snow, and promising a due degree of watchfulness, he gave the dollar a whirl of twenty feet in the air, and catching it as it fell in the palm of his hand, he withdrew to the kitchen, to exhibit his present, with a heart as light as his face was happy in its expression.\n\n\"Oh, rest easy, my dear coz,\" said the young lady; \"I took a look in at my father, who is likely to sleep an hour; and by using due vigilance you will secure all the honors of the season.\"\n\n\"Why, Duke is your father, Elizabeth; but 'Duke is a man who likes to be foremost, even in trifles. Now, as for myself, I care for no such things, except in the way of competition; for a thing which is of no moment in itself may be made of importance in the way of competition. So it is with your father\u2014he loves to be first; but I only; struggle with him as a competitor.\"\n\n\"It's all very clear, sir,\" said Elizabeth; \"you would not care a fig for distinction if there were no one in the world but yourself; but as there happens to be a great many others, why, you must struggle with them all\u2014in the way of competition.\"\n\n\"Exactly so; I see you are a clever girl, Bess, and one who does credit to her masters. It was my plan to send you to that school; for when your father first mentioned the thing, I wrote a private letter for advice to a judicious friend in the city, who recommended the very school you went to. 'Duke was a little obstinate at first, as usual, but when he heard the truth he was obliged to send you.\"\n\n\"Well, a truce to 'Duke's foibles, sir; he is my father, and if you knew what he has been doing for you while we were in Albany, you would deal more tenderly with his character.\"\n\n\"For me!\" cried Richard, pausing a moment in his walk to reflect. \"Oh! he got the plans of the new Dutch meeting-house for me, I suppose; but I care very little about it, for a man of a certain kind of talent is seldom aided by any foreign suggestions; his own brain is the best architect.\"\n\n\"No such thing,\" said Elizabeth, looking provokingly knowing.\n\n\"No! let me see\u2014perhaps he had my name put in the bill for the new turnpike, as a director.\"\n\n\"He might possibly; but it is not to such an appointment that I allude.\"\n\n\"Such an appointment!\" repeated Mr. Jones, who began to fidget with curiosity; \"then it is an appointment. If it is in the militia, I won't take it.\n\n\"No, no, it is not in the militia,\" cried Elizabeth, showing the packet in her hand, and then drawing it back with a coquettish air; \"it is an office of both honor and emolument.\"\n\n\"Honor and emolument!\" echoed Richard, in painful suspense; \"show me the paper, girl. Say, is it an office where there is anything to do?\"\n\"You have hit it, Cousin Dickon; it is the executive office of the county; at least so said my father when he gave me this packet to offer you as a Christmas-box. Surely, if anything will please Dickon,' he said, 'it will be to fill the executive chair of the county.'\"\n\n\"Executive chair! what nonsense!\" cried the impatient gentleman, snatching the packet from her hand; \"there is no such office in the county. Eh! what! it is, I declare, a commission, appointing Richard Jones, Esquire, sheriff of the county. Well, this is kind in 'Duke, positively. I must say 'Duke has a warm heart, and never forgets his friends. Sheriff! High Sheriff of\u2014! it sounds well, Bess, but it shall execute better. 'Duke is a judicious man after all, and knows human nature thoroughly, I'm much obliged to him,\" continued Richard, using the skirt of his coat unconsciously to wipe his eyes; \"though I would do as much for him any day, as he shall see, if I have an opportunity to perform any of the duties of my office on him. It shall be done, Cousin Bess\u2014\u2014it shall be done, I say. How this cursed south wind makes one's eyes water!\"\n\"Now, Richard,\" said the laughing maiden, \"now I think you will find something to do. I have often heard you complain of old that there was nothing to do in this new country, while to my eyes it seemed as if everything remained to be done.\"\n\n\"Do!\" echoed Richard, who blew his nose, raised his little form to its greatest elevation, and looked serious. \"Everything depends on system, girl. I shall sit down this afternoon and systematize the county. I must have deputies, you know. I will divide the county into districts, over which I will place my deputies; and I will have one for the village, which I will call my home department. Let me see\u2014ho! Benjamin! yes, Benjamin will make a good deputy; he has been naturalized, and would answer admirably if he could only ride on horseback.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Sheriff,\" said his companion; \"and as he understands ropes so well, he would be very expert, should occasion happen for his services in another way.\"\n\n\"No,\" interrupted the other; \"I flatter myself that no man could hang a man better than\u2014that is\u2014ha!\u2014oh! yes, Benjamin would do extremely well in such an unfortunate dilemma, if he could be persuaded to attempt it. But I should despair of the thing. I never could induce him to hang, or teach him to ride on horseback. I must seek another deputy.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, as you have abundant leisure for all these important affairs, I beg that you will forget that you are high sheriff, and devote some little of your time to gallantry. Where are the beauties and improvements which you were to show me?\"\n\n\"Where? why, everywhere! Here I have laid out some new streets; and when they are opened, and the trees felled, and they are all built up, will they not make a fine town? Well, 'Duke is a liberal-hearted fellow, with all his stubbornness. Yes, yes; I must have at least four deputies, besides a jailer.\"\n\n\"I see no streets in the direction of our walk,\" said Elizabeth, \"unless you call the short avenues through these pine bushes by that name. Surely you do not contemplate building houses, very soon, in that forest before us, and in those swamps.\"\n\n\"We must run our streets by the compass, coz, and disregard trees, hills, ponds, stumps, or, in fact, anything but posterity. Such is the will of your father, and your father, you know\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Had you made sheriff, Mr. Jones,\" interrupted the lady, with a tone that said very plainly to the gentleman that he was touching a forbidden subject.\n\n\"I know it, I know it,\" cried Richard; \"and if it were in my power, I'd make 'Duke a king. He is a noble hearted fellow, and would make an excellent king; that is, if he had a good prime minister. But who have we here? voices in the bushes\u2014a combination about mischief, I'll wager my commission. Let us draw near and examine a little into the matter.\"\n\nDuring this dialogue, as the parties had kept in motion, Richard and his cousin advanced some distance from the house into the open space in the rear of the village, where, as may be gathered from the conversation, streets were planned and future dwellings contemplated; but where, in truth, the only mark of improvement that was to be seen was a neglected clearing along the skirt of a dark forest of mighty pines, over which the bushes or sprouts of the same tree had sprung up to a height that interspersed the fields of snow with little thickets of evergreen. The rushing of the wind, as it whistled through the tops of these mimic trees, prevented the footsteps of the pair from being heard, while the branches concealed their persons. Thus aided, the listeners drew nigh to a spot where the young hunter, Leather-Stocking, and the Indian chief were collected in an earnest consultation. The former was urgent in his manner, and seemed to think the subject of deep importance, while Natty appeared to listen with more than his usual attention to what the other was saying. Mohegan stood a little on one side, with his head sunken on his chest, his hair falling forward so as to conceal most of his features, and his whole attitude expressive of deep dejection, if not of shame. \"Let us withdraw,\" whispered Elizabeth; \"we are intruders, and can have no right to listen to the secrets of these men.\"\n\n\"No right!\" returned Richard a little impatiently, in the same tone, and drawing her arm so forcibly through his own as to prevent her retreat; \"you forget, cousin, that it is my duty to preserve the peace of the county and see the laws executed, these wanderers frequently commit depredations, though I do not think John would do anything secretly. Poor fellow! he was quite boozy last night, and hardly seems to be over it yet. Let us draw nigher and hear what they say.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the lady's reluctance, Richard, stimulated doubtless by his sense of duty, prevailed; and they were soon so near as distinctly to hear sounds.\n\n\"The bird must be had,\" said Natty, \"by fair means or foul. Heigho! I've known the time, lad, when the wild turkeys wasn't over-scarce in the country; though you must go into the Virginia gaps if you want them now. 'to be sure, there is a different taste to a partridge and a well-fatted turkey; though, to my eating, beaver's tail and bear's ham make the best of food. But then every one has his own appetite. I gave the last farthing, all to that shilling, to the French trader, this very morning, as I came through the town, for powder; so, as you have nothing, we can have but one shot for it. I know that Billy Kirby is out, and means to have a pull of the trigger at that very turkey. John has a true eye for a single fire, and, some how, my hand shakes so whenever I have to do anything extrawnary, that I often lose my aim. Now, when I killed the she-bear this fall, with her cubs, though they were so mighty ravenous, I knocked them over one at a shot, and loaded while I dodged the trees in the bargain; but this is a very different thing, Mr. Oliver.\"\n\n\"This,\" cried the young man, with an accent that sounded as if he took a bitter pleasure in his poverty, while he held a shilling up before his eyes, \"this is all the treasure that I possess\u2014this and my rifle! Now, indeed, I have become a man of the woods, and must place my sole dependence on the chase. Come, Natty, let us stake the last penny for the bird; with your aim, it cannot fail to be successful.\"\n\"I would rather it should be John, lad; my heart jumps into my mouth, because you set your mind so much out; and I'm sartain that I shall miss the bird. Them Indians can shoot one time as well as another; nothing ever troubles them. I say, John, here's a shilling; take my rifle, and get a shot at the big turkey they've put up at the stump. Mr. Oliver is over-anxious for the creatur', and I'm sure to do nothing when I have over-anxiety about it.\"\n\nThe Indian turned his head gloomily, and after looking keenly for a moment, in profound silence, at his companions, he replied:\n\n\"When John was young, eyesight was not straighter than his bullet. The Mingo squaws cried out at the sound of his rifle. The Mingo warriors were made squaws. When did he ever shoot twice? The eagle went above the clouds when he passed the wigwam of Chingachgook; his feathers were plenty with the women. But see,\" he said, raising his voice from the low, mournful tones in which he had spoken to a pitch of keen excitement, and stretching forth both hands, \"they shake like a deer at the wolf's howl. Is John old? When was a Mohican a squaw with seventy winters? No! the white man brings old age with him\u2014rum is his tomahawk!\"\n\n\"Why, then, do you use it, old man?\" exclaimed the young hunter; \"why will one, so noble by nature, aid the devices of the devil by making himself a beast?\"\n\n\"Beast! is John a beast?\" replied the Indian slowly; \"yes; you say no lie, child of the Fire-eater! John is a beast. The smokes were once few in these hills, The deer would lick the hand of a white man and the birds rest on his head. They were strangers to him. My fathers came from the shores of the salt lake. They fled before rum. They came to their grandfather, and they lived in peace; or, when they did raise the hatchet, it was to strike it into the brain of a Mingo. They gathered around the council fire, and what they said was done. Then John was a man. But warriors and traders with light eyes followed them. One brought the long knife and one brought rum. They were more than the pines on the mountains; and they broke up the councils and took the lands, The evil spirit was in their jugs, and they let him loose. Yes yes\u2014you say no lie, Young Eagle; John is a Christian beast.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, old warrior,\" cried the youth, grasping his hand; \"I should be the last to reproach you. The curses of Heaven light on the cupidity that has destroyed such a race. Remember, John, that I am of your family, and it is now my greatest pride.\"\n\nThe muscles of Mohegan relaxed a little, and he said, more mildly:\n\n\"You are a Delaware, my son; your words are not heard\u2014John cannot shoot.\"\n\n\"I thought that lad had Indian blood in him,\" whispered Richard, \"by the awkward way he handled my horses last night. You see, coz, they never use harness. But the poor fellow shall have two shots at the turkey, if he wants it, for I'll give him another shilling myself; though, per haps, I had better offer to shoot for him. They have got up their Christmas sports, I find, in the bushes yonder, where you hear the laughter\u2014though it is a queer taste this chap has for turkey; not but what it is good eating, too.\"\n\n\"Hold, Cousin Richard,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, clinging to his arm; \"would it be delicate to offer a shilling to that gentleman?\"\n\n\"Gentleman, again! Do you think a half-breed, like him, will refuse money? No, no, girl, he will take the shilling; ay! and even rum too, notwithstanding he moralizes so much about it, But I'll give the lad a chance for his turkey; for that Billy Kirby is one of the best marksmen in the country; that is, if we except the\u2014the gentleman.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Elizabeth, who found her strength unequal to her will, \"then, sir, I will speak.\" She advanced, with an air of determination, in front of her cousin, and entered the little circle of bushes that surrounded the trio of hunters. Her appearance startled the youth, who at first made an unequivocal motion toward retiring, but, recollecting himself, bowed, by lifting his cap, and resumed his attitude of leaning on his rifle. Neither Natty nor Mohegan betrayed any emotion, though the appearance of Elizabeth was so entirely unexpected.\n\n\"I find,\" she said, \"that the old Christmas sport of shooting the turkey is yet in use among you. I feel inclined to try my chance for a bird. Which of you will take this money, and, after paying my fee, give me the aid of his rifle?\"\n\n\"Is this a sport for a lady?\" exclaimed the young hunter, with an emphasis that could not well be mistaken, and with a rapidity that showed he spoke without consulting anything but feeling. \"Why not, sir? If it be inhuman the sin is not confined to one sex only. But I have my humor as well as others. I ask not your assistance, but\"\u2014turning to Natty, and dropping a dollar in his hand\u2014\"this old veteran of the forest will not be so ungallant as to refuse one fire for a lady.\"\n\nLeather-Stocking dropped the money into his pouch, and throwing up the end of his rifle he freshened his priming; and first laughing in his usual manner, he threw the piece over his shoulder, and said:\n\n\"If Billy Kirby don't get the bird before me, and the Frenchman's powder don't hang fire this damp morning, you'll see as fine a turkey dead, in a few minutes, as ever was eaten in the Judge's shanty. I have knowed the Dutch women, on the Mohawk and Schoharie, count greatly on coming to the merry-makings; and so, lad, you shouldn't be short with the lady. Come, let us go forward, for if we wait the finest bird will be gone.\"\n\n\"But I have a right before you, Natty, and shall try on my own luck first. You will excuse me, Miss Temple; I have much reason to wish that bird, and may seem ungallant, but I must claim my privileges.\"\n\n\"Claim anything that is justly your own, sir,\" returned the lady; \"we are both adventurers; and this is my knight. I trust my fortune to his hand and eye. Lead on, Sir Leather-Stocking, and we will follow.\"\n\nNatty, who seemed pleased with the frank address of the young and beauteous Elizabeth, who had so singularly intrusted him with such a commission, returned the bright smile with which she had addressed him, by his own peculiar mark of mirth, and moved across the snow toward the spot whence the sounds of boisterous mirth proceeded, with the long strides of a hunter. His companions followed in silence, the youth casting frequent and uneasy glances toward Elizabeth, who was detained by a motion from Richard.\n\n\"I should think, Miss Temple,\" he said, so soon as the others were out of hearing, \"that if you really wished a turkey, you would not have taken a stranger for the office, and such a one as Leather-Stocking. But I can hardly believe that you are serious, for I have fifty, at this moment, shut up in the coops, in every stage of fat, so that you might choose any quality you pleased. There are six that I am trying an experiment on, by giving them brick-bats with\u2014\"\n\n\"Enough, Cousin Dickon,\" interrupted the lady; \"I do wish the bird, and it is because I so wish that I commissioned this Mr. Leather-Stocking.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of the great shot that I made at the wolf, Cousin Elizabeth, who was carrying off your father's sheep?\" said Richard, drawing himself up with an air of displeasure. \"He had the sheep on his hack; and, had the head of the wolf been on the other side, I should have killed him dead; as it was\u2014\"\n\n\"You killed the sheep\u2014I know it all, dear coz. Hut would it have been decorous for the High Sheriff of\u2014to mingle in such sports as these?\"\n\n\"Surely you did not think that I intended actually to fire with my own hands?\" said Mr. Jones. \"But let us follow, and see the shooting. There is no fear of anything unpleasant occurring to a female in this new country, especially to your father's daughter, and in my presence.\"\n\n\"My father's daughter fears nothing, sir, more especially when escorted by the highest executive officer in the county.\"\n\nShe took his arm, and he led her through the mazes of the bushes to the spot where most of the young men of the village were collected for the sports of shooting a Christmas match, and whither Natty and his Companions had already preceded them.", "http://genius.com/James-fenimore-cooper-the-pioneers-chap-16-annotated"], "2406765": ["All Missing Pop Songs from 2015 by\u00a0Glorious\u00a0IQ Bonus", "All Missing Pop Songs from 2015 Lyrics\n\nPOP\n2nd Quarter\nBarbarossa - Imager (stream link)\n1.

NISSIM BERNARD \u2014 OUTLINE OF THE STRANGE CHARACTER OF MOREL \u2014 M. DE CHARLUS DINES WITH THE VERDURINS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my fear lest the pleasure I found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother, I sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone; in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart, threw up vast pillars there; but my heart was doubtless too small for it, I had not the strength to bear so great a grief, my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion, and its arches collapsed before joining as, before they have perfected their curve, the waves of the sea totter and break\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if only from my dreams when I was asleep, I might have learned that my grief for my grandmother\u2019s death was diminishing, for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that I had formed of her non-existence. I saw her an invalid still, but on the road to recovery, I found her in better health. And if she made any allusion to what she had suffered, I stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured. I should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers. Only, I no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times. Her words were no more than a feeble, docile response, almost a mere echo of mine; she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incapable as I still was of feeling any fresh physical desire, Albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness. Certain dreams of shared affection, always floating on the surface of our minds, ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory (provided that this has already become slightly vague) of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure. This sentiment recalled to me aspects of Albertine\u2019s face, more gentle, less gay, quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire; and as it was also less pressing than that desire I would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter, without seeking to see Albertine again at Balbec, before her departure. But even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive. From my bed, where I was made to spend hours every day resting, I longed for Albertine to come and resume our former amusements. Do we not see, in the very room in which they have lost a child, its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother? I tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day\u2019s sea. As in the former year, the seas, from one day to another, were rarely the same. Nor, however, did they at all resemble those of that first year, whether because we were now in spring with its storms, or because even if I had come down at the same time as before, the different, more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas, indolent, vaporous and fragile, which I had seen throughout long, scorching days, asleep upon the beach, their bluish bosoms, only, faintly stirring, with a soft palpitation, or, as was most probable, because my eyes, taught by Elstir to retain precisely those elements that before I had deliberately rejected, would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing. The contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that I took with Mme. de Villeparisis and this proximity, fluid, inaccessible, mythological, of the eternal Ocean, no longer existed for me. And there were days now when, on the contrary, the sea itself seemed almost rural. On the days, few and far between, of really fine weather, the heat had traced upon the waters, as it might be across country, a dusty white track, at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishing-boat stood up like a village steeple. A tug, of which one could see only the funnel, was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields, while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white, sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface, made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building, an hospital or a school. And the clouds and the wind, on days when these were added to the sun, completed if not the error of judgment, at any rate the illusion of the first glance, the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination. For the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops, the rough, yellow, almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface, the banks, the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest, all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied, as solid, as broken, as populous, as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which I used to travel, and was soon to be travelling again. And once, unable any longer to hold out against my desire, instead of going back to bed I put on my clothes and started off to Incarville, to find Albertine. I would ask her to come with me to Douville, where I would pay calls at F\u00e9terne upon Mme. de Cambremer and at la Raspeli\u00e8re upon Mme. Verdurin. Albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark. I went to take the train on the local light railway, of which I had picked up, the time before, from Albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district, where it was known as theTwister because of its numberless windings, the Crawler because the train never seemed to move, the Transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line, the Decauville and the Funi, albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff, and, although not, strictly speaking, a Decauville, had a 60 centimetre gauge, the B. A. G. because it ran between Balbec and Grattevast via Angerville, the Tram and the T. S. N. because it was a branch of the Tramways of Southern Normandy. I took my seat in a compartment in which I was alone; it was a day of glorious sunshine, and stiflingly hot; I drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight. But immediately I beheld my grandmother, as she had appeared sitting in the train, on our leaving Paris for Balbec, when, in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer, she had preferred not to look, to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep. I, who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy, I had inflicted this anguish upon her, not merely of seeing me accept, at the invitation of another, a drink which she regarded as bad for me, I had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart\u2019s content, worse still, by my bursts of passion, my choking fits, I had forced her to help, to advise me to do so, with a supreme resignation of which I saw now in my memory the mute, despairing image, her eyes closed to shut out the sight. So vivid a memory had, like the stroke of a magic wand, restored the mood that I had been gradually outgrowing for some time past; what had I to do with Rosemond\u00e9 when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman, what had I to say to the Cambremers and Verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered. I could not remain in the compartment. As soon as the train stopped at Maineville-la-Teinturiere, abandoning all my plans, I alighted. Maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own, because a director of various casinos, a caterer in pleasure, had set up, just outside it, with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel, an establishment to which we shall return anon, and which was, to put it briefly, the first brothel for \u2018exclusive\u2019 people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of France. It was the only one. True, every port has its own, but intended for sailors only, and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see, next door to the primeval parish church, the bawd, hardly less ancient, venerable and moss-grown, standing outside her ill-famed door, waiting for the return of the fishing fleet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrying past the glittering house of \u2018pleasure,\u2019 insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor, I reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of Balbec. I heard, without responding to it, the appeal of the hawthorns. Neighbours, in humbler circumstances, of the blossoming apple trees, they found them very coarse, without denying the fresh complexion of the rosy-petalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider. They knew that, with a lesser dowry, they were more sought after, and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On my return, the hotel porter handed me a black-bordered letter in which the Marquis and the Marquise de Gonneville, the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse d\u2019Amfreville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Berneville, the Marquis and the Marquise de Graincourt, the Comte d\u2019Amenoncourt, the Comtesse de Maineville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Franquetot, the Comtesse de Chaverny n\u00e9e d\u2019Aigleville, begged to announce, and from which I understood at length why it had been sent to me when I caught sight of the names of the Marquise de Cambremer n\u00e9e du Mesnil la Guichard, the Marquis and the Marquise de Cambremer, and saw that the deceased, a cousin of the Cambremers, was named El\u00e9onore-Euphrasie-Humbertine de Cambremer, Comtesse de Criquetot. In the whole extent of this provincial family, the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines, not a single commoner, and on the other hand not a single title that one knew, but the entire muster-roll of the nobles of the region who made their names \u2014 those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood \u2014 ring out their joyous endings in ville, in court, sometimes on a duller note (in tot). Garbed in the roof-tiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church, their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall, and then only to cap themselves with the Norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret, they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues, and to have paraded them in massed formation, without one absentee, one intruder, on the compact, rectangular draught-board of the aristocratic letter edged with black\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother had gone upstairs to her room, meditating the phrase of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cI see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you; the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you, and that annoys me.\u201d\u2014 because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction. To me he whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Parme!\u201d My fears were dispelled when I saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to Her Royal Highness. But as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to Mme. de Luxembourg, the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the Princesse de Parme \u2014 and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no wish to remain there by myself. It was barely four o\u2019clock. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to go and find Albertine, so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue, I think, to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which Albertine was to inspire in me, not to mention the special character, emphatically Gomorrhan, which that mistrust was to assume. Certainly, even that afternoon \u2014 but this was not the first time \u2014 I grew anxious as I was kept waiting. Fran\u00e7oise, once she had started, stayed away so long that I began to despair. I had not lighted the lamp. The daylight had almost gone. The wind was making the flag over the casino flap. And, fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising, and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless, unnatural hour, a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing Viennese waltzes. At length Fran\u00e7oise arrived, but unaccompanied. \u201cI have been as quick as I could but she wouldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t think she was looking smart enough. If she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself, she was an hour by the clock. You\u2019ll be having a regular scentshop in here. She\u2019s coming, she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass. I thought I should find her here.\u201d There was still a long time to wait before Albertine appeared. But the gaiety, the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow. She informed me (in contradiction of what she had said the other day) that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange, as in the former year, to meet daily. I told her that at the moment I was too melancholy and that I would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment, as I did in Paris. \u201cIf ever you\u2019re feeling worried, or feel that you want me, do not hesitate,\u201d she told me, \u201cto send for me, I shall come immediately, and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel, I shall stay as long as you like.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, in bringing her to me, had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful. But Albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy, and the very next day Fran\u00e7oise was to greet me with the profound observation: \u201cMonsieur ought not to see that young lady. I know quite well the sort she is, she\u2019ll land you in trouble.\u201d As I escorted Albertine to the door I saw in the lighted dining-room the Princesse de Parme. I merely gave her a glance, taking care not to be seen. But I must say that I found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the Guermantes\u2019. It is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are, and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand, in his own house, to shew that he is not in his own home but in the Prince\u2019s. Now the Princesse de Parme may not have formulated this idea to herself, but she was so imbued with it that all her actions, spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances, pointed to it. When she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to Aim\u00e9, as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding, before leaving a country house, a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her. Nor did she stop at the tip, but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly, flattering words, with a store of which her mother had provided her. Another moment, and she would have told him that, just as the hotel was perfectly managed, so Normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred France to any other country in the world. Another coin slipped from the Princess\u2019s fingers, for the wine waiter, for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection. The lift-boy had come up at that moment with a message for her; he too received a little speech, a smile and a tip, all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves. As Aim\u00e9, the wine waiter, the lift-boy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them, she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly; such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels, the people who passed by, not knowing who she was, thought they beheld a permanent resident at Balbec, who, because of her humble origin, or for professional reasons (she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne) was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors. As for me, I thought of the palace at Parma, of the counsels, partly religious, partly political, given to this Princess, who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day. All the more, as if she were already reigning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs again to my room, but I was not alone there. I could hear some one softly playing Schumann. No doubt it happens at times that people, even those whom we love best, become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us. There is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain: to wit, a piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends, and had made me write down their addresses as well, in case I should want her on one of those evenings, for none of them lived very far away. This meant that when I tried to find her, going from one girl to another, she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers. I must confess that many of her friends \u2014 I was not yet in love with her \u2014 gave me, at one watering-place or another, moments of pleasure. These obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many. But recently I have thought it over, their names have recurred to me. I counted that, in that one season, a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours. A name came back to me later, which made thirteen. I then, with almost a child\u2019s delight in cruelty, dwelt upon that number. Alas, I realised that I had forgotten the first of them all, Albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had, to resume the thread of my narrative, written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom I should find her upon the days when she was not to be at Incarville, but privately had decided that I would devote those days rather to calling upon Mme. Verdurin. In any case, our desire for different women varies in intensity. One evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who, after that, for the next month or two, will never enter our mind. Then there is the law of change, for a study of which this is not the place, under which, after an over-exertion of the flesh, the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow. As for Albertine, I saw her seldom, and only upon the very infrequent evenings when I felt that I could not live without her. If this desire seized me when she was too far from Balbec for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to go and fetch her, I used to send the lift-boy to Egreville, to La Sogne, to Saint-Frichoux, asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual. He would come into my room, but would leave the door open for, albeit he was conscientious at his \u2018job\u2019 which was pretty hard, consisting in endless cleanings from five o\u2019clock in the morning, he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door, and, if one were to remark to him that it was open, would turn back and, summoning up all his strength, give it a gentle push. With the democratic pride that marked him, a pride to which, in more liberal careers, the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain, barristers, doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a \u2018brother\u2019 barrister, doctor or man of letters, he, employing, and rightly, a term that is confined to close corporations like the Academy, would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days: \u201cI shall get my colleagueto take my place.\u201d This pride did not prevent him from accepting, with a view to increasing what he called his \u2018salary,\u2019 remuneration for his errands, a fact which had made Fran\u00e7oise take a dislike to him: \u201cYes, the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession, but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door. It\u2019s your money he\u2019s after.\u201d This was the category in which she had so often in-cluded Eulalie, and in which, alas (when I think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it), she already placed Albertine, because she saw me often asking Mamma, on behalf of my impecunious friend, for trinkets and other little presents, which Fran\u00e7oise held to be inexcusable because Mme. Bontemps had only a general servant. A moment later the lift-boy, having removed what I should have called his livery and he called his tunic, appeared wearing a straw hat, carrying a cane, holding himself stiffly erect, for his mother had warned him never to adopt the \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018pageboy\u2019 style. Just as, thanks to books, all knowledge is open to a work-ing man, who ceases to be such when he has finished his work, so, thanks to a \u2018boater\u2019 hat and a pair of gloves, elegance became accessible to the lift-boy who, having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs, imagined himself, like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall, or Serjeant Saint-Loup out of uniform, a typical young man about town. He was not for that matter lacking in ambition, or in talent either in manipu-lating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors. But his vocabulary was defective. I credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter, under whom he served: \u201cMy porter,\u201d in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a \u2018private mansion\u2019 in Paris would have referred to his footman. As for the lift-boy\u2019s vocabulary, it is curious that anybody who heard people, fifty times a day, calling for the \u2018lift,\u2019 should never himself call it anything but a \u2018left.\u2019 There were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying: whatever I might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase: \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it, or else to take all the credit for it to himself, as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject. \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed with the utmost emphasis, issued from his lips every other minute, over matters to which he had never given a thought, a trick which irritated me so much that I immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it. But to my second assertion, albeit it was incompatible with the first, he replied none the less stoutly: \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cI say!\u201d as though these words were inevitable. I found it difficult, also, to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling, which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense, in a figurative sense only, which gave them an air of feeble witticism, for instance the verb to pedal. He never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle. But if, on foot, he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time, then, to indicate that he had walked fast, he would exclaim: \u201cI should say I didn\u2019t half pedal!\u201d The lift-boy was on the small side, clumsily built and by no means good looking. This did not prevent him, whenever one spoke to him of some tall, slim, handsome young man, from saying: \u201cOh, yes, I know, a fellow who is just my height.\u201d And one day when I was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message, hearing somebody come upstairs, I had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as Endymion, with incredibly perfect features, who was bringing a message to a lady whom I did not know. When the lift-boy returned, in telling him how impatiently I had waited for the answer, I mentioned to him that I had thought I heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the H\u00f4tel de Normandie. \u201cOh, yes, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have only the one, a boy about my build. He\u2019s so like me in face, too, that we\u2019re always being mistaken; anybody would think he was my brother.\u201d Lastly, he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second, which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say: \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me; but other people, as we get to know them, are like a metal dipped in an acid bath, and we see them gradually lose their good qualities (and their bad qualities too, at times). Before giving him my instructions, I saw that he had left the door open; I pointed this out to him, I was afraid that people might hear us; he acceded to my request and returned, having reduced the gap. \u201cAnything to oblige. But there\u2019s nobody on this floor except us two.\u201d Immediately I heard one, then a second, then a third person go by. This annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard, but more still because I could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence. \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be the maid next door going for her things. Oh, that\u2019s of no importance, it\u2019s the bottler putting away his keys. No, no, it\u2019s nothing, you can say what you want, it\u2019s my colleague just going on duty.\u201d Then, as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me, at a formal order from me he went, not to shut the door, which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a \u2018motor,\u2019 but to push it a little closer to. \u201cNow we shall be quite quiet.\u201d So quiet were we that an American lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room. \u201cYou are going to bring this young lady back with you,\u201d I told him, after first going and banging the door with all my might (which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open). \u201cYou remember the name: Mlle. Albertine Simonet. Anyhow, it\u2019s on the envelope. You need only say to her that it\u2019s from me. She will be delighted to come,\u201d I added, to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own self-esteem. \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cNot at all, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come. It\u2019s a great nuisance getting here from Berneville.\u201d \u201cI understand!\u201d \u201cYou will tell her to come with you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand perfectly,\u201d he replied, in that sharp, precise tone which had long ceased to make a \u2018good impression\u2019 upon me because I knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t any too much time,\u201d said the lift-boy, who, carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs, omitted the pronoun altogether. \u201cCan go there all right. Leave was stopped this afternoon, because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon. And it was my turn off duty to-day. So it\u2019s all right if I go out a bit this evening. Take my bike with me. Get there in no time.\u201d And an hour later he reappeared and said: \u201cMonsieur\u2019s had to wait, but the young lady\u2019s come with me. She\u2019s down below.\u201d \u201cOh, thanks very much; the porter won\u2019t be cross with me?\u201d \u201cMonsieur Paul? Doesn\u2019t even know where I\u2019ve been. The head of the door himself can\u2019t say a word.\u201d But once, after I had told him: \u201cYou absolutely must bring her back with you,\u201d he reported to me with a smile: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her. She\u2019s not there. Couldn\u2019t wait any longer; was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was \u2018missed from the hotel\u201d (for the lift-boy, who used the word \u2018rejoin\u2019 of a profession which one joined for the first time, \u201cI should like to rejoin the post-office,\u201d to make up for this, or to mitigate the calamity, were his own career at stake, or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else, elided the prefix and said: \u201cI know he\u2019s been \u2018missed\u201d). It was not with any evil intent that he smiled, but from sheer timidity. He thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it. In the same way, if he had said to me: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d this did not mean that he really thought that I knew it already. On the contrary, he was all too certain that I did not know it, and, what was more, was afraid to tell me. And so he said \u2018you know\u2019 to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge. We ought never to lose our tempers with people who, when we find fault with them, begin to titter. They do so not because they are laughing at us, but because they are trembling lest we should be angry. Let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh. For all the world like a stroke, the lift-boy\u2019s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar. He wound up by telling me that Albertine was not at Egreville, that she would not be coming back there before nine o\u2019clock, and that if betimes (which meant, by chance) she came back earlier, my message would be given her, and in any case she would be with me before one o\u2019clock in the morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Translator\u2019s note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume I ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not this evening, however, that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form. No, to make no mystery about it, although the incident did not occur until some weeks later, it arose out of a remark made by Cottard. Albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at Incarville where, as luck would have it, I should not have joined them (having intended to go and see Mme. Verdurin who had invited me again and again), had I not been held up at Incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair. As I strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it, I found myself all of a sudden face to face with Doctor Cottard, who had come to Incarville to see a patient. I almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters. But friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people. Not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as well-bred people, Cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing, even denying their existence, until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them. He apologised, had indeed received my letters, had reported my whereabouts to the Verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see. He even proposed to take me to them there and then, for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner. As I hesitated and he had still some time before his train ( for there was bound to be still a considerable delay), I made him come with me to the little casino, one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival, now filled with the tumult of the girls, who, in the absence of male partners, were dancing together. Andr\u00e9e came sliding along the floor towards me; I was meaning to go off with Cottard in a moment to the Verdurins\u2019, when I definitely declined his offer, seized by an irresistible desire to stay with Albertine. The fact was, I had just heard her laugh. And her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh, the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way, seeming also, as strong, sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums, to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance, irritant and secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the girls, a stranger to me, sat down at the piano, and Andr\u00e9e invited Albertine to waltz with her. Happy in the thought that I was going to remain in this little casino with these girls, I remarked to Cottard how well they danced together. But he, taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an ill-breeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends, although he must have seen me shaking hands with them, replied: \u201cYes, but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits. I should certainly never let mine come here. Are they nice-looking, though? I can\u2019t see their faces. There now, look,\u201d he went on, pointing to Albertine and Andr\u00e9e who were waltzing slowly, tightly clasped together, \u201cI have left my glasses behind and I don\u2019t see very well, but they are certainly keenly roused. It is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts. And theirs, as you see, are completely touching.\u201d And indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of Andr\u00e9e and of Albertine. I do not know whether they heard or guessed Cottard\u2019s observation, but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz. At that moment Andr\u00e9e said something to Albertine, who laughed, the same deep and penetrating laugh that I had heard before. But all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain; Albertine appeared to be revealing by it, to be making Andr\u00e9e share some exquisite, secret thrill. It rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited. I left the place with Cottard, distracted by his conversation, thinking only at odd moments of the scene I had just witnessed. This does not mean that Cottard\u2019s conversation was interesting. It had indeed, at that moment, become bitter, for we had just seen Doctor du Boulbon go past without noticing us. He had come down to spend some time on the other side of Balbec bay, where he was greatly in demand. Now, albeit Cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays, he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast, a hope which du Boulbon\u2019s presence there doomed to disappointment. Certainly, the Balbec doctor could not stand in Cottard\u2019s way. He was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything, and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing, in a complicated formula, the ointment, lotion or liniment that would put you right. As Marie Gineste used to say, in her charming speech, he knew how to \u2018charm\u2019 cuts and sores. But he was in no way eminent. He had indeed caused Cottard some slight annoyance. The latter, now that he was anxious to exchange his Chair for that of Therapeutics, had begun to specialise in toxic actions. These, a perilous innovation in medicine, give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists\u2019 shops, where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic, unlike its substitutes, and indeed to be disintoxicant. It is the fashionable cry; at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering, like the faint trace of an older fashion, the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected. Toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient, who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance. Now, a Grand Duke who had come for a few days to Balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for Cottard who, in return for a wad of hundred-franc notes (the Professor refused to see anyone for less), had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment. As the swelling did not go down, the Grand Duke fell back upon the general practitioner of Balbec, who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust. The following day, the swelling had gone. A celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was, however, a more dangerous rival. He was a rubicund, jovial person, since, for one thing, the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health, but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good-bye,\u2019 while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in strait-waistcoats later on. Nevertheless, whenever you spoke to him at a party, whether of politics or of literature, he would listen to you with a kindly attention, as though he were saying: \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d without at once giving an opinion, as though it were a matter for consultation. But anyhow he, whatever his talent might be, was a specialist. And so the whole of Cottard\u2019s rage was heaped upon du Boulbon. But I soon bade good-bye to the Verdurins\u2019 professional friend, and returned to Balbec, after promising him that I would pay them a visit before long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mischief that his remarks about Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had done me was extreme, but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me, as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, on the night after the lift-boy had gone in search of her, did not appear, notwithstanding his assurances. Certainly, personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as: \u201cNo, this evening I shall not be free.\u201d We barely notice this speech if we are with friends; we are gay all the evening, a certain image never enters our mind; during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution; when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear. We become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before, because, even if we continue not to fear death, we no longer dare think of a parting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From, however, not one o\u2019clock in the morning (the limit fixed by the lift-boy), but three o\u2019clock, I no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish. The certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete, refreshing calm; this night was simply a night like all the rest during which I did not see her, such was the idea from which I started. After which, the thought that I should see her in the morning, or some other day, outlining itself upon the blank which I submissively accepted, became pleasant. Sometimes, during these nights of waiting, our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken. The sufferer, misinterpreting his own symptoms, thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear. Love is engendered in these cases, as are certain nervous maladies, by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort. An explanation which it is useless to correct, at any rate so far as love is concerned, a sentiment which (whatever its cause) is invariably in error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day, when Albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to Epreville, and so had not received my note in time, and was coming, if she might, to see me that evening, behind the words of her letter, as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone, I thought I could detect the presence of pleasures, of people whom she had preferred to me. Once again, I was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing, by the latent love which we always carry within us; I almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to Albertine, but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing, the last echo of which died away without the machine\u2019s having been set in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had failed during my first visit to Balbec \u2014 and perhaps, for that matter, Andr\u00e9e had failed equally \u2014 to understand Albertine\u2019s character. I had put it down as frivolous, but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a garden-party, a donkey ride, a picnic. During my second visit to Balbec, I began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show, the garden-party a mere screen, if not an invention. She shewed herself in various colours in the following incident (by which I mean the incident as seen by me, from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent, and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side). Albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection. She looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home, it appeared, every afternoon at five o\u2019clock, at Infreville. Tormented by suspicion, and feeling at the same time far from well, I asked Albertine, I implored her to remain with me. It was impossible (and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer) because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable, highly susceptible and, said Albertine, a perfect nuisance. \u201cBut one can easily cut a call.\u201d \u201cNo, my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness.\u201d \u201cBut I have so often seen you being impolite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt. I\u2019m pretty well in her bad books already. She expects me to go and see her.\u201d \u201cBut if she\u2019s at home every day?\u201d Here Albertine, feeling that she was caught, changed her line of argument. \u201cSo she is at home every day. But to-day I\u2019ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there. It will be less boring that way.\u201d \u201cSo then, Albertine, you prefer this lady and your friends to me, since, rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call, you prefer to leave me here alone, sick and wretched?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is boring. I\u2019m going for their sake. I shall bring them home in my trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t have any way of getting back.\u201d I pointed out to Albertine that there were trains from Infreville up to ten o\u2019clock at night. \u201cQuite true, but don\u2019t you see, it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner. She is very hospitable.\u201d \u201cVery well then, you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI should only make my aunt angry.\u201d \u201cBesides, you can dine with her and catch the ten o\u2019clock train.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cutting it rather fine.\u201d \u201cThen I can never go and dine in town and come back by train. But listen, Albertine. We are going to do something quite simple, I feel that^the fresh air will do me good; since you can\u2019t give up your lady, I am going to come with you to Infreville. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shan\u2019t go as far as the Tour Elisabeth\u201d (the lady\u2019s villa), \u201cI shall see neither the lady nor your friends.\u201d Albertine started as though she had received a violent blow. For a moment, she was unable to speak. She explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to come with you?\u201d \u201cHow can you say such a thing, you know there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than going out with you.\u201d A sudden change of tactics had occurred. \u201cSince we are going for a drive together,\u201d she said to me, \u201cwhy not go out in the other direction, we might dine together. It would be so nice. After all, that side of Balbec is much the prettier. I\u2019m getting sick of Infreville and all those little spinach-bed places.\u201d \u201cBut your aunt\u2019s friend will be annoyed if you don\u2019t go and see her.\u201d \u201cVery well, let her be.\u201d \u201cNo, it is wrong to annoy people.\u201d \u201cBut she won\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m not there, she has people every day; I can go to-morrow, the next day, next week, the week after, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ve cut me often enough. It\u2019s my turn now.\u201d \u201cBut from the side you suggest there\u2019s no train back after nine.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? Nine will do perfectly. Besides, one need never think about getting back. We can always find a cart, a bike, if the worse comes to the worst, we have legs.\u201d \u201cWe can always find, Albertine, how you go on! Out Infreville way, where the villages run into one another, well and good. But the other way, it\u2019s a very different matter.\u201d \u201cThat way too. I promise to bring you back safe and sound.\u201d I felt that Albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me, and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as I was. Seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question, since I insisted upon accompanying her, she gave it up altogether. She knew that the loss was not irremediable. For, like all women who have a number of irons in the fire, she had one resource that never failed: suspicion and jealousy. Of course she did not seek to arouse them, quite the contrary. But lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood. With the result that Albertine, being no better than anyone else, knew by experience (without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy) that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment. The stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt, would love her all the more for that (though Albertine did not know that this was the reason), and, so as not to prolong the agony, would return to her of his own accord, as I should have done. But I had no desire either to give pain to another, or to tire myself, or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation, of multiform, unending vigilance. \u201cNo, Albertine, I do not wish to spoil your pleasure, go to your lady at Infreville, or rather to the person you really mean to see, it is all the same to me. The real reason why I am not coming with you is that you do not wish it, the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take, which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it.\u201d Poor Albertine was afraid that her contradictions, which she had not noticed, had been more serious than they were. Not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me: \u201cIt is quite on the cards that I did contradict myself. The sea air makes me lose my head altogether. I\u2019m always calling things by the wrong names.\u201d And (what proved to me that she would not, now, require many tender affirmations to make me believe her) I felt a stab in my heart as I listened to this admission of what I had but faintly imagined. \u201cVery well, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m off,\u201d she said in a tragic tone, not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person, now that I had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad of you. I alter all my plans to spend a nice, long evening with you, and it\u2019s you that won\u2019t have it, and you accuse me of telling lies. I\u2019ve never known you to be so cruel. The sea shall be my tomb. I will never see you any more.\u201d (My heart leaped at these words, albeit I was certain that she would come again next day, as she did.) \u201cI shall drown myself, I shall throw myself into the water.\u201d \u201cLike Sappho.\u201d \u201cThere you go, insulting me again. You suspect not only what I say but what I do.\u201d \u201cBut, my lamb, I didn\u2019t mean anything, I swear to you, you know Sappho flung herself into the sea.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, you have no faith in me.\u201d She saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock; she was afraid of missing her appointment, and choosing the shortest form of farewell (for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day, the other person presumably not being free then), she dashed from the room, crying: \u201cGood-bye for ever,\u201d in a heartbroken tone. And perhaps she was heartbroken. For knowing what she was about at that moment better than I, being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than I was towards her, she may all the same have had a fear that I might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me. And I believe that she was attached to me, so much so that the other person was more jealous than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, at Balbec, while we were in the ballroom of the casino, there entered Bloch\u2019s sister and cousin, who had both turned out quite pretty, but whom I refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends, because the younger one, the cousin, was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit. Andr\u00e9e, at a murmured allusion to this scandal, said to me: \u201cOh! About that sort of thing I\u2019m like Albertine; there\u2019s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing.\u201d As for Albertine, on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa, she had turned her back on the disreputable pair. I had noticed, however, that, before she changed her position, at the moment when Mlle. Bloch and her cousin appeared, my friend\u2019s eyes had flashed with that sudden, close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious, indeed a grave air, and left her pensive afterwards. But Albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative. Mlle. Bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner, I asked Albertine whether the little fair one (the one who was so intimate with the actress) was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cis one of them fair? I must confess they don\u2019t interest me particularly, I have never looked at them. Is one of them fair?\u201d she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry. When applied to people whom Albertine passed every day on the front, this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appear to be looking at us much either,\u201d I said to Albertine, perhaps (on the assumption, which I did not however consciously form, that Albertine loved her own sex), to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that, generally speaking, it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know. \u201cThey weren\u2019t looking at us!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s astonished reply. \u201cWhy, they did nothing else the whole time.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly tell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cyou had your back to them.\u201d \u201cVery well, and what about that?\u201d she replied, pointing out to me, set in the wall in front of us, a large mirror which I had not noticed and upon which I now realised that my friend, while talking to me, had never ceased to fix her troubled, preoccupied eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the day when Cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at Incarville, albeit I did not share the opinion that he had expressed, Albertine had seemed to me different; the sight of her made me lose my temper. I myself had changed, quite as much as she had changed in my eyes. I had ceased to bear her any good will; to her face, behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her, I spoke of her in the most insulting language. There were, however, intervals of calmer feeling. One day I learned that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had both accepted an invitation to Elstir\u2019s. Feeling certain that this was in order that they might, on the return journey, amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women, and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart, without announcing my intention, to embarrass them and to deprive Albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning, I paid an unexpected call at his studio. But I found only Andr\u00e9e there. Albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her. Then I said to myself that Cottard must have been mistaken; the favourable impression that I received from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards Albertine. But this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies, who are prostrated again by the merest trifle. Albertine incited Andr\u00e9e to actions which, without going very far, were perhaps not altogether innocent; pained by this suspicion, I managed in the end to repel it. No sooner was I healed of it than it revived under another form. I had just seen Andr\u00e9e, with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her, lay her head coaxingly on Albertine\u2019s shoulder, kiss her on the throat, half shutting her eyes; or else they had exchanged a glance; a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe: little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood, but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them. Sometimes even without my having seen Albertine again, without anyone\u2019s having spoken to me about her, there would flash from my memory some vision of her with Gis\u00e8le in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time; it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that I had managed to recover, I had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside, I had, as Cottard would have said, supplied my own toxin. I thought then of all that I had been told about Swann\u2019s love for Odette, of the way in which Swann had been tricked all his life. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of Albertine\u2019s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that I could not control in its entirety, was the memory, the rooted idea of Mme. Swann\u2019s character, as it had been described to me. These accounts helped my imagination, in after years, to take the line of supposing that Albertine might, instead of being a good girl, have had the same immorality, the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute, and I thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had I ever really been her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, outside the Grand Hotel, where we were gathered on the front, I had just been addressing Albertine in the harshest, most humiliating language, and Rosemonde was saying: \u201cOh, how you have changed your mind about her; why, she used to be everything, it was she who ruled the roost, and now she isn\u2019t even fit to be thrown to the dogs.\u201d I was beginning, in order to make my attitude towards Albertine still more marked, to say all the nicest things I could think of to Andr\u00e9e, who, if she was tainted with the same vice, seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic, when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front, at the corner of which we were standing, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s barouche. The chief magistrate who, at that moment, was advancing towards us, sprang back upon recognising the carriage, in order not to be seen in our company; then, when he thought that the Marquise\u2019s eye might catch his, bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat. But the carriage, instead of continuing, as might have been expected, along the Rue de la Mer, disappeared through the gate of the hotel. It was quite ten minutes later when the lift-boy, out of breath, came to announce to me: \u201cIt\u2019s the Marquise de Camembert, she\u2019s come here to see Monsieur. I\u2019ve been up to the room, I looked in the reading-room, I couldn\u2019t find Monsieur anywhere. Luckily I thought of looking on the beach.\u201d He had barely ended this speech when, followed by her daughter-in-law and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman, the Marquise advanced towards me, coming on probably from some afternoon tea-party in the neighbourhood, and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself, in order to appear as \u2018well dressed\u2019 as possible to the people whom she went to visit. It was in fact that \u2018landing\u2019 of the Cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let Legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to Balbec. Then Mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible. And here it was actually happening, but by different channels and without Legrandin\u2019s having had any part in it. \u201cDo you mind my staying here, if I shan\u2019t be in your way?\u201d asked Albertine (in whose eyes there lingered, brought there by the cruel things I had just been saying to her, a pair of tears which I observed without seeming to see them, but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight), \u201cthere is something I want to say to you.\u201d A hat with feathers, itself surmounted by a sapphire pin, was perched haphazard upon Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s wig, like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient, its place immaterial, its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous. Notwithstanding the heat, the good lady had put on a jet cloak, like a dalmatic, over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season, but upon the nature of the ceremony. And on Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s bosom a baronial torse, fastened to a chain, dangled like a pectoral cross. The gentleman was an eminent lawyer from Paris, of noble family, who had come down to spend a few days with the Cambremers. He was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession, and who say, for instance: \u201cI know that I am a good pleader, so it no longer amuses me to plead,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in operating, I know that I\u2019m a good operator.\u201d Men of intelligence, artists, they see themselves in their maturity, richly endowed by success, shining with that intellect, that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment. They form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist, but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished, and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them. Le Sidaner was the artist chosen by the Cambremers\u2019 friend, who incidentally was a delightful person. He talked well about books, but not about the books of the true masters, those who have mastered themselves. The only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions, such as \u2018for the most part,\u2019 which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking. Madame de Cambremer had taken the opportunity, she told me, of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the Balbec direction to come and call upon me, as she had promised Robert de Saint-Loup. \u201cYou know he\u2019s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days: His uncle Charlus is staying near here with his sister-in-law, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, and M. de Saint-Loup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment, where he is very popular, highly respected. We often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises. How nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to F\u00e9terne.\u201d I presented Albertine and her friends. Mme. de Cambremer introduced us all to her daughter-in-law. The latter, so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at F\u00e9terne forced her to associate, so reserved, so afraid of compromising herself, held out her hand to me with a radiant smile, safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of Robert de Saint-Loup, whom he, possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear, had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the Guermantes. So, unlike her mother-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness. It was at the most the former kind, dry, insupportable, that she would have conceded me had I met her through her brother Legrandin. But for a friend of the Guermantes she had not smiles enough. The most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the reading-room, that place once so terrible into which I now went a dozen times every day, emerging freely, my own master, like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey. And so I offered to take Mme. de Cambremer there. And as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me, since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people, it was without the slightest emotion that I made this suggestion. But she declined it, preferring to remain out of doors, and we sat down in the open air, on the terrace of the hotel. I found there and rescued a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which Mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight, when she heard that visitors had called for me. No less than my grandmother, she dreaded these invasions of strangers, and, in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen, would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her. Madame de Cambremer carried in her hand, with the handle of a sunshade, a number of embroidered bags, a hold-all, a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets, and a lace handkerchief. I could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair; but I felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood. We gazed at the calm sea upon which, here and there, a few gulls floated like white petals. Because of the \u2018mean level\u2019 to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which, we suppose, ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us, I began instinctively to talk to Mme. de Cambremer n\u00e9e Legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked. \u201cThey appear,\u201d I said, referring to the gulls, \u201cas motionless and as white as water-lilies.\u201d And indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about, so much so that the waves, by contrast, seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention, to have acquired life. The dowager Marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from Balbec, or to say how she envied it, she who from la Raspeli\u00e8re (where for that matter she was not living that year) had only such a distant glimpse of the waves. She had two remarkable habits, due at once to her exalted passion for the arts (especially for the art of music), and to her want of teeth. Whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands \u2014 like those of certain animals when in rut \u2014 became so overcharged that the old lady\u2019s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place. Immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh, like a person recovering his breath. Secondly, if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty, in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions, vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose. Now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at Balbec could indeed offer a \u2018seascape,\u2019 and Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s simple words changed my ideas in that respect. On the other hand, as I told her, I had always heard people praise the matchless view from la Raspeli\u00e8re, perched on the summit of the hill, where, in a great drawing-room with two fireplaces, one whole row of windows swept the gardens, and, through the branches of the trees, the sea as far as Balbec and beyond it, and the other row the valley. \u201cHow nice of you to say so, and how well you put it: the sea through the branches. It is exquisite, one would say . . . a painted fan.\u201d And I gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches, that the compliment was sincere. But the Marquise n\u00e9e Legrandin remained cold, to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her mother-in-law. Besides, she not only despised the other\u2019s intellect but deplored her affability, being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the Cambremers. \u201cAnd how charming the name is,\u201d said I. \u201cOne would like to know the origin of all those names.\u201d \u201cThat one I can tell you,\u201d the old lady answered modestly. \u201cIt is a family place, it came from my grandmother Arrachepel, not an illustrious family, but a decent and very old country stock.\u201d \u201cWhat! Not illustrious!\u201d her daughter-in-law tartly interrupted her. \u201cA whole window in Bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms, and the principal church at Avranches has their tombs. If these old names interest you,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve come a year too late. We managed to appoint to the living of Criquetot, in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another, the parish priest of a place where I myself have some land, a long way from here, Combray, where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic. Unfortunately, the sea air was no good to him at his age; his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to Combray. But he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters, and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district. It has given him a fresh interest, too, for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon Combray and its surroundings. I shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of F\u00e9terne. It is worthy of a Benedictine. You will find the most interesting things in it about our old Raspeli\u00e8re, of which my mother-in-law speaks far too modestly.\u201d \u201cIn any case, this year,\u201d replied the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cla Raspeli\u00e8re is no longer ours and does not belong to me. But I can see that you have a painter\u2019s instincts; I am sure you sketch, and I should so like to shew you F\u00e9terne, which is far finer than la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d For as soon as the Cambremers had let this latter residence to the Verdurins, its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past, that is to say to offer the advantage, without parallel in the neighbourhood, of looking out over both sea and valley, and had on the other hand, suddenly and retrospectively, presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it. In short, one might have supposed that if Mme. de Cambremer had let it, it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses. And she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand, at F\u00e9terne, she who for so many years (forgetting the two months that she spent there) had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama. \u201cI am discovering it at my age,\u201d she said, \u201cand how I enjoy it! It does me a world of good. I would let la Raspeli\u00e8re for nothing so as to be obliged to live at F\u00e9terne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo return to more interesting topics,\u201d went on Legrandin\u2019s sister, who addressed the old Marquise as \u2018Mother,\u2019 but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence, \u201cyou mentioned water-lilies: I suppose you know Claude Monet\u2019s pictures of them. What a genius! They interest me particularly because near Combray, that place where I told you I had some land. . . . \u201d But she preferred not to talk too much about Combray. \u201cWhy! That must be the series that Elstir told us about, the greatest painter of this generation,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, who had said nothing so far. \u201cAh! I can see that this young lady loves the arts,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer and, drawing a long breath, recaptured a trail of spittle. \u201cYou will allow me to put Le Sidaner before him, Mademoiselle,\u201d said the lawyer, smiling with the air of an expert. And, as he had enjoyed, or seen people enjoy, years ago, certain \u2018daring\u2019 work by Elstir, he added: \u201cElstir was gifted, indeed he was one of the advance guard, but for some reason or other he never kept up, he has wasted his life.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer disagreed with the lawyer, so far as Elstir was concerned, but, greatly to the annoyance of her guest, bracketed Monet with Le Sidaner. It would be untrue to say that she was a fool; she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me. As the sun was beginning to set, the seagulls were now yellow, like the water-lilies on another canvas of that series by Monet. I said that I knew it, and (continuing to copy the diction of her brother, whom I had not yet dared to name) added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier, for, at the same hour, there would have been a Poussin light for her to admire. Had some Norman squireen, unknown to the Guermantes, told her that she ought to have come a day earlier, Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air. But I might have been far more familiar still, and she would have been all smiles and sweetness; I might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which Mme. de Cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests. But the name of Poussin, without altering the amenity of the society lady, called forth the protests of the connoisseur. On hearing that name, she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, after a painter like Monet, who is an absolute genius, don\u2019t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent, like Poussin. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that I find him the deadliest bore. I mean to say, you can\u2019t really call that sort of thing painting. Monet, Degas, Manet, yes, there are painters if you like! It is a curious thing,\u201d she went on, fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind, \u201cit is a curious thing, I used at one time to prefer Manet. Nowadays, I still admire Manet, of course, but I believe I like Monet even more. Oh! The Cathedrals!\u201d She was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste. And one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not, in her eyes, any less important than the different manners of Monet himself. Not that I had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences, for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them. When a noble dame of Avranches, who would have been incapable of distinguishing between Mozart and Wagner, said in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing: \u201cWe saw nothing of any interest while we were in Paris, we went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, they were doing Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, it\u2019s dreadful stuff,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d and to \u2018argue the point.\u2019 It was perhaps a Combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother\u2019s sisters, who called it \u2018fighting in the good cause,\u2019 and loved the dinner-parties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the Philistines. Similarly, Mme. de Cambremer liked to \u2018fly into a passion\u2019 and wrangle about art, as other people do about politics. She stood up for Debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised. She must however have known very well that when she said: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d she could not improvise in the other lady, whom she was putting in her place, the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion. \u201cI must ask Le Sidaner what he thinks of Poussin,\u201d the lawyer remarked to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular recluse, never opens his mouth, but I know how to get things out of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnyhow,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer went on, \u201cI have a horror of sunsets, they\u2019re so romantic, so operatic. That is why I can\u2019t abide my mother-in-law\u2019s house, with its tropical plants. You will see it, it\u2019s just like a public garden at Monte-Carlo. That\u2019s why I prefer your coast, here. It is more sombre, more sincere; there\u2019s a little lane from which one doesn\u2019t see the sea. On rainy days, there\u2019s nothing but mud, it\u2019s a little world apart. It\u2019s just the same at Venice, I detest the Grand Canal and I don\u2019t know anything so touching as the little alleys. But it\u2019s all a question of one\u2019s surroundings.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I remarked to her, feeling that the only way to rehabilitate Poussin in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion, \u201cM. Degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the Poussins at Chantilly.\u201d \u201cIndeed? I don\u2019t know the ones at Chantilly,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer who had no wish to differ from Degas, \u201cbut I can speak about the ones in the Louvre, which are appalling.\u201d \u201cHe admires them immensely too.\u201d \u201cI must look at them again. My impressions of them are rather distant,\u201d she replied after a moment\u2019s silence, and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain, before very long, to form of Poussin would depend, not upon the information that I had just communicated to her, but upon the supplementary and, this time, final examination that she intended to make of the Poussins in the Louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind. Contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since, if she did not yet admire the Poussins, she was adjourning the matter for further consideration, in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer, I told her mother-in-law how much I had heard of the wonderful flowers at F\u00e9terne. In modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house, into which in the mornings, by simply pushing open a door, she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks, hunt for new-laid eggs, and gather the zinnias or roses which, on the sideboard, framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers, reminded her of her garden paths. \u201cIt is true, we have a great many roses,\u201d she told me, \u201cour rose garden is almost too near the house, there are days when it makes my head ache. It is nicer on the terrace at la Raspeli\u00e8re where the breeze carries the scent of the roses, but it is not so heady.\u201d I turned to her daughter-in-law. \u201cIt is just like Pell\u00e9as,\u201d I said to her, to gratify her taste for the modern, \u201cthat scent of roses wafted up to the terraces. It is so strong in the score that, as I suffer from hay-fever and rose-fever, it sets me sneezing every time I listen to that scene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a marvellous thing Pell\u00e9as is,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cI\u2019m mad about it;\u201d and, drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me, using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes, she began to hum something which, I supposed, represented to her the farewells of Pell\u00e9as, and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that Mme. de Cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it. \u201cI think it is even finer than Parsifal,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause in Parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases, which are bad simply because they are melodious.\u201d \u201cI know, you are a great musician, Madame,\u201d I said to the dowager. \u201cI should so much like to hear you play.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation. Being of the opinion that what her mother-in-law liked was not music at all, she regarded the talent, a sham talent according to her, though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest. It was true that Chopin\u2019s only surviving pupil declared, and with justice, that the Master\u2019s style of playing, his \u2018feeling\u2019 had been transmitted, through herself, to Mme. de Cambremer alone, but to play like Chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of Legran-din\u2019s sister, who despised nobody so much as the Polish composer. \u201cOh! They are flying away,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, pointing to the gulls which, casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito, were rising in a body towards the sun. \u201cTheir giant wings from walking hinder them,\u201d quoted Mme. de Cambremer, confusing the seagull with the albatross. \u201cI do love them; I used to see them at Amsterdam,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cThey smell of the sea, they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even.\u201d \u201cOh! So you have been in Holland, you know the Vermeers?\u201d Mme. de Cambremer asked imperiously, in the tone in which she would have said: \u201cYou know the Guermantes?\u201d for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent. Albertine replied in the negative, thinking that they were living people. But her mistake was not apparent. \u201cI should be delighted to play to you,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me. \u201cBut you know I only play things that no longer appeal to your generation. I was brought up in the worship of Chopin,\u201d she said in a lowered tone, for she was afraid of her daughter-in-law, and knew that to the latter, who considered that Chopin was not music, playing him well or badly were meaningless terms. She admitted that her mother-in-law had technique, was a finished pianist. \u201cNothing will ever make me say that she is a musician,\u201d was Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin\u2019s conclusion. Because she considered herself \u2018advanced,\u2019 because (hi matters of art only) \u201cone could never move far enough to the Left,\u201d she said, she maintained not merely that music progressed, but that it progressed along one straight line, and that Debussy was in a sense a super-Wagner, slightly more advanced again than Wagner. She did not take into account the fact that if Debussy was not as independent of Wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years\u2019 time, because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered, he was seeking nevertheless, after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete, in which everything was expressed, to satisfy an opposite demand. There were theories of course, to support this reaction for the time being, like those theories which, in politics, come to the support of the laws against religious communities, of wars in the East (unnatural teaching, the Yellow Peril, etc., etc.). People said that an age of speed required rapidity in art, precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight, or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches, which the motor-car, for all that, was to restore to favour. Composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience, as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention, among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest. For the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to Bayreuth to listen to the Ring. Besides, the day was to come when, for a season, Debussy would be pronounced as trivial as Massenet, and the trills of M\u00e9lisande degraded to the level of Manon\u2019s. For theories and schools, like microbes and corpuscles, devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence. But that time was still to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on the Stock Exchange, when a rise occurs, a whole group of securities benefit by it, so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction, either because they did not deserve such scorn, or simply \u2014 which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises \u2014 because they had incurred it. And people even went the length of seeking out, in an isolated past, men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence, but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably. Often it was because a master, whoever he may be, however exclusive his school, judges in the light of his own untutored instincts, does justice to talent wherever it be found, or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past, which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence. Or, it may be, because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create. Then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor; he values in him, under a wholly different form, an effort that is momentarily, partially fraternal. There are bits of Turner in the work of Poussin, we find a phrase of Flaubert in Montesquieu. Sometimes, again, this rumoured predilection of the Master was due to an error, starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school. But in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time, for if there is an element of free will, some genuine taste expressed in the master\u2019s choice, the schools themselves go only by theory. Thus it is that the mind, following its habitual course which advances by digression, inclining first in one direction, then in the other, had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice, or for a renewal of standards, or the taste of Debussy, or his caprice, or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of Chopin. Commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence, profiting by the admiration that was aroused by Pell\u00e9as, they had acquired a fresh lustre, and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves, albeit preserving the illusion of free will. But Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin spent part of the year in the country. Even in Paris, being an invalid, she was largely confined to her own room. It is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language, a distinction that she did not perceive, for she derived them more from reading than from conversation. The latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions. Unfortunately this revival of the Nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics. The news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the \u2018younger\u2019 people. It remained unknown to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. I gave myself the pleasure of informing her, but by addressing my remark to her mother-in-law, as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion, that Chopin, so far from being out of date, was Debussy\u2019s favourite composer. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s quaint,\u201d said the daughter-in-law with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of Pell\u00e9as. Nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to Chopin with respect and even pleasure. Moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy. Her eyes shone like the eyes of Latude in the play entitled Latude, or Thirty-five Years in Captivity, and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which Beethoven has so well described in Fidelio, at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again \u2018this life-giving air.\u2019 As for the dowager, I thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek. \u201cWhat, you like Chopin? He likes Chopin, he likes Chopin,\u201d she cried with a nasal trumpet-tone of passion; she might have been saying: \u201cWhat, you know Mme. de Franquetot too?\u201d with this difference, that my relations with Mme. de Franquetot would have left her completely indifferent, whereas my knowledge of Chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium. Her salivary super-secretion no longer sufficed. Not having attempted even to understand the part played by Debussy in the rediscovery of Chopin, she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable. Her musical enthusiasm overpowered her. \u201cElodie! Elodie! He likes Chopin!\u201d her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms. \u201cAh! I knew at once that you were a musician,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him. He\u2019s so lovely!\u201d And her voice was as pebbly as if, to express her ardour for Chopin, she had copied Demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach. Then came the turn of the tide, reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm\u2019s way and which was flooded; and lastly the Marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of Chopin had steeped her moustaches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin remarked to me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother-in-law\u2019s cutting it rather fine, she\u2019s forgotten that we\u2019ve got my Uncle de Ch\u2019nouville dining. Besides, Cancan doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d The word \u2018Cancan\u2019 was beyond me, and I supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog. But as for the Ch\u2019nouville relatives, the explanation was as follows. With the lapse of time the young Marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner. And yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband. In other social circles, when one referred to the Chenouville family, the custom was (whenever, that is to say, the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound, for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de, the tongue refusing to utter Madam\u2019 d\u2019Ch\u2019nonceaux) that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed. One said: \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Chenouville.\u201d The Cambremer tradition was different, but no less imperious. It was the mute e of Chenouville that was suppressed. Whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine, it was always de Chenouvilleand never de Chenouville. (Of the father of these Chenouvilles, one said \u2018our Uncle\u2019 for they were not sufficiently \u2018smart set\u2019 at F\u00e9terne to pronounce the word \u2018Unk\u2019 like the Guermantes, whose deliberate jargon, suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words, was as difficult to understand as Old French or a modern dialect.) Every newcomer into the family circle at once received, in the matter of the Ch\u2019nouvilles, a lesson which Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin had not required. When, paying a call one day, she had heard a girl say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d \u201cMy Unk de Rouan,\u201d she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing: Uz\u00e8s, and Rol\u00eean, she had felt the astonishment, embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat. But during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated: \u201cMy Aunt Uzai,\u201d with that suppression of the final s, a suppression that had stupefied her the day before, but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that, one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the Duchesse d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, Mlle. Legrandin had answered her crossly, and in an arrogant tone: \u201cYou might at least pronounce her name properly: Mme. d\u2019Uzai.\u201d From that moment she had realised that, by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements, the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father, the finished education that she had received, her regular attendance at the Sorbonne, whether at Caro\u2019s lectures or at Brunetiere\u2019s, and at the Lamoureux concerts, all this was to be rendered volatile, to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai.\u201d This did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate, in the earlier days, at least, of her married life, not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing, but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say (since that, after all, was why she was marrying): \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d and, when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach, \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt de Ch\u2019nouville,\u201d and \u201cI shall ask you to dine to meet the Uzai.\u201d Her marriage to M. de Cambremer had procured for Mlle. Legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter, the circle in which her parents-in-law moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream. After saying to me of Saint-Loup (adopting for the occasion one of his expressions, for if in talking to her I used those expressions of Legrandin, she by a reverse suggestion answered me in Robert\u2019s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from Rachel), bringing her thumb and forefinger together and half-shutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing: \u201cHe has a charming quality of mind,\u201d she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him (it had indeed been alleged that, some time back, when he was at Don-ci\u00e8res, Robert had been her lover), in reality simply that I might repeat her words to him, and ended up with: \u201cYou are a great friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes. I am an invalid, I never go anywhere, and I know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends, which I do think so wise of her, and so I know her very slightly, but I know she is a really remarkable woman.\u201d Aware that Mme. de Carnbremer barely knew her, and anxious to reduce myself to her level, I avoided the subject and answered the Marquise that the person whom I did know well was her brother, M. Legrandin. At the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of Mme. de Guermantes, but combined with it an expression of annoyance, for she supposed that I had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her. Was she gnawed by despair at having been born a Legrandin? So at least her husband\u2019s sisters and sisters-in-law asserted, ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing, and were jealous of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s intelligence, her education, her fortune, the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness. \u201cShe can think of nothing else, that is what is killing her,\u201d these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of Mme. de Cambremer to no matter whom, but preferably to a plebeian, whether, were he conceited and stupid, to enhance, by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin, the value of the affability that they were shewing him, of, if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself, to give themselves the pleasure, while receiving him hospitably, of insulting him indirectly. But if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sister-in-law, they were mistaken. She suffered not at all from having been born Legrandin, for she had forgotten the fact altogether. She was annoyed at my reminding her of it, and remained silent as though she had not understood, not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit,\u201d said the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, who was probably more satiated than her daughter-in-law with the pleasure to be derived from saying \u2018Ch\u2019nouville.\u2019 \u201cBut, so as not to bother you with too many people, Monsieur,\u201d she went on, indicating the lawyer, \u201cwas afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel. They are waiting for us on the beach, and they will be growing impatient.\u201d I asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them. The wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family, and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye. And as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants, just as on the blemished face of his mother, an identical mole, which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species, protruded below the eye of the son. The lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son. He shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at Balbec. \u201cYou must find yourself rather out of your element, for the people here are for the most part foreigners.\u201d And he kept his eye on me as he spoke, for, not caring for foreigners, albeit he had many foreign clients, he wished to make sure that I was not hostile to his xenophobia, in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying: \u201cOf course, Mme. X\u2014\u2014-may be a charming woman. It\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d As at that time I had no definite opinion about foreigners, I shewed no sign of disapproval; he felt himself to be on safe ground. He went so far as to invite me to come one day, in Paris, to see his collection of Le Sidaner, and to bring with me the Cambremers, with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms. \u201cI shall invite you to meet Le Sidaner,\u201d he said to me, confident that from that moment I would live only in expectation of that happy day. \u201cYou shall see what a delightful man he is. And his pictures will enchant you. Of course, I can\u2019t compete with the great collectors, but I do believe that I am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases. They will interest you all the more, coming from Balbec, since they are marine subjects, for the most part, at least.\u201d The wife and son, blessed with a vegetable nature, listened composedly. One felt that their house in Paris was a sort of temple of Le Sidaner. Temples of this sort are not without their use. When the god has doubts as to his own merits, he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a signal from her daughter-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer prepared to depart, and said to me: \u201cSince you won\u2019t come and stay at F\u00e9terne, won\u2019t you at least come to luncheon, one day this week, to-morrow for instance?\u201d And in her bounty, to make the invitation irresistible, she added: \u201cYou will find the Comte de Crisenoy,\u201d whom I had never lost, for the simple reason that I did not know him. She was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations, but stopped short. The chief magistrate who, on returning to the hotel, had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere, then waited his opportunity, and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance, came up now to greet her. I gathered that Mme. de Cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me. And yet he had known her far longer than I, having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at F\u00e9terne whom I used so to envy during my former visit to Balbec. But old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society. And hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity, especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like Saint-Loup\u2019s of me. Mme. de Cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me, but, to calm her guilty conscience, began addressing him in the kindest tone. In the sunlight that flooded, on the horizon, the golden coastline, invisible as a rule, of Rivebelle, we could just make out, barely distinguishable from the luminous azure, rising from the water, rosy, silvery, faint, the little bells that were sounding the ang\u00e9lus round about F\u00e9terne. \u201cThat is ratherPell\u00e9as, too,\u201d I suggested to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. \u201cYou know the scene I mean.\u201d \u201cOf course I do!\u201d was what she said; but \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea\u201d was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air. The dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far, and rose, reminded of the time. \u201cBut, as a rule,\u201d I said, \u201cwe never see that part of the coast from Balbec, nor hear it either. The weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one. Unless, that is to say, the bells have come to look for you, since I see that they are making you leave; to you they are a dinner bell.\u201d The chief magistrate, little interested in the bells, glanced furtively along the front, on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening. \u201cYou are a true poet,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to me. \u201cOne feels you are so responsive, so artistic, come, I will play you Chopin,\u201d she went on, raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach. Then came the deglutition of spittle, and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief. The chief magistrate did me, unconsciously, a great service by offering the Marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage, a certain blend of vulgarity, boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk, and which are by no means unsuccessful in society. He was, moreover, and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself. While blessing him for what he did I did not venture to copy him, and walked by the side of Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that I had in my hand. The name of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 drew a grimace from her; and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers, but which, used in speech and given a feminine form, and applied to a seventeenth century writer, had an odd effect, she asked me: \u201cDo you think her really masterly?\u201d The Marquise gave her footman the address of a pastry-cook where she had to call before taking the road, rosy with the evening haze, through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff. She asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough, whether the other\u2019s shoe were not hurting him. \u201cI shall write to you and make a definite engagement,\u201d she murmured to me. \u201cI heard you talking about literature to my daughter-in-law, she\u2019s a darling,\u201d she went on, not that she really thought so, but she had acquired the habit \u2014 and kept it up in her kindness of heart \u2014 of saying so, in order that her son might not appear to have married for money. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth, \u201cshe\u2019s so harttissttick!\u201d With this she stepped into her carriage, nodding her head, holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier, and set off through the streets of Balbec, overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood, like an old Bishop on a confirmation tour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has asked you to luncheon,\u201d the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and I came indoors with the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the best of terms just now. She feels that I neglect her. Gad, I\u2019m easy enough to get on with. If anybody needs me, I\u2019m always there to say: Adsum! But they tried to force my hand. That, now,\u201d he went on with an air of subtlety, holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction, \u201cthat is a thing I do not allow. It is a threat to the liberty of my holidays. I was obliged to say: Stopl You seem to be in her good books. When you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing, and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles. Well, I am going to take a turn before dinner. Good-bye, children,\u201d he shouted back at us, as though he were already fifty yards away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had said good-bye to Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, they saw with astonishment that Albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them. \u201cWhy, Albertine, what are you doing, don\u2019t you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cGo home,\u201d she replied in a tone of authority. \u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d she added, indicating myself with a submissive air. Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le stared at me, filled with a new and strange respect. I enjoyed the feeling that, for a moment at least, in the eyes even of Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, I was to Albertine something more important than the time, than her friends, and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted. \u201cShan\u2019t we see you again this evening?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it will depend on this person. Anyhow, to-morrow.\u201d \u201cLet us go up to my room,\u201d I said to her, when her friends had gone. We took the lift; she remained silent in the boy\u2019s presence. The habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters, those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them, develops in \u2018employees\u2019 (as the lift-boy styled servants), a stronger power of divination than the \u2018employer\u2019 possesses. Our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle, accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes. Since railways came into existence, the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives, the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed. And so the lift-boy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that Albertine and I were preoccupied. But he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact. And yet I could see upon his face, in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift, an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness. As I knew nothing of the cause of this, in an attempt to distract his thoughts, and albeit I was more preoccupied than Albertine, I told him that the lady who had just left was called the Marquise de Cambremer and not de Camembert. On the landing at which we were pausing at the moment, I saw, carrying a pair of pails, a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect, hoping for a tip when I left. I should have liked to know if she were the one whom I had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at Balbec, but I could never arrive at any certainty. The lift-boy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses, but without shedding his expression of despair, that it was indeed by the name of Camembert that the Marquise had told him to announce her. And as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew. Besides, having those very vague ideas of nobility, and of the names of which titles are composed, which are shared by many people who are not lift-boys, the name Camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as, that cheese being universally known, it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction, unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese. Nevertheless as he saw that I refused to admit that I might be mistaken, and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted, he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say Cambremer. It is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town, none of the peasants in the district, where the name and persons of the Cambremers were perfectly familiar, could ever have made the lift-boy\u2019s mistake. But the staff of the \u2018Grand Hotel of Balbec\u2019 were none of them natives. They came direct, with the furniture and stock, from Biarritz, Nice and Monte-Carlo, one division having been transferred to Deauville, another to Dinard and the third reserved for Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the lift-boy\u2019s pained anxiety continued to grow. That he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles, some misfortune must have befallen him. Perhaps he had been \u2018\u2018missed.\u2019 I made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement, the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff. \u201cYou can always do just what you like, I rectify everything in advance.\u201d Suddenly, as I stepped out of the lift, I guessed the meaning of the boy\u2019s distress, his panic-stricken air. Because Albertine was with me, I had not given him the five francs which I was in the habit of slipping into his hand when I went up. And the idiot, instead of understanding that I did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person, had begun to tremble, supposing that it was all finished, that I would never give him anything again. He imagined that I was \u2018on the rocks\u2019 (as the Duc de Guermantes would have said), and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment. I told myself that I was less unreasonable than my mother thought when I dared not, one day, refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that I had given the day before. But at the same time the meaning that I had until then, and without a shadow of doubt, ascribed to his habitual expression of joy, in which I had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion, seemed to me to have become less certain. Seeing the lift-boy ready, in his despair, to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel, I asked myself whether, if our respective social stations were to be altered, in consequence let us say of a revolution, instead of politely working his lift for me, the boy, grown independent, would not have flung me down the well, and whether there was not, in certain of the lower orders, more duplicity than in society, where, no doubt, people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot, but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One cannot however say that, in the Balbec hotel, the lift-boy was the most commercially minded. From this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories; on the one hand, those who drew distinctions between the visitors, and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman (who, moreover, was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to General de Beautreillis) than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity. On the other hand, those to whom nobility, intellect, fame, position, manners were nonexistent, concealed under a cash valuation. For these there was but a single standard, the money one has, or rather the money one bestows. Possibly Aim\u00e9 himself, albeit pretending, in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served, to a great knowledge of the world, belonged to this latter category. At the most he would give a social turn, shewing that he knew who was who, to this sort of appreciation, as when he said of the Princesse de Luxembourg: \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of money among that lot?\u201d (the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained, before supplying a client with a \u2018chef for Paris, or promising him a table on the left, by the door, with a view of the sea, at Balbec). In spite of this, and albeit not free from sordid considerations, he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the lift-boy. And yet, the latter\u2019s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things. It is the convenience of a big hotel, of a house such as Rachel used at one time to frequent, that, without any intermediary, the face, frozen stiff until that moment, of a servant or a woman, at the sight of a hundred-franc note, still more of one of a thousand, even although it is being given to some one else, will melt in smiles and offers of service. Whereas in the dealings, in the relations between lover and mistress, there are too many things interposed between money and docility. So many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together, believe themselves to be, and indeed are more refined. Besides, it rids polite conversation of such speeches as: \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left for me to do, you will find me to-morrow in the mortuary.\u201d And so one meets in polite society few novelists, or poets, few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor, Albertine began: \u201cWhat is it, you have got against me?\u201d Had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself? Had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part, with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her, and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that I had long since formed about her was correct? However that may be, when I heard her question, I suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal. Before answering her, I escorted her to the door of my room. Opening it, I scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask. I went across to the window; the gulls had settled again upon the waves; but this time they were pink. I drew Albertine\u2019s attention to them. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she said, \u201cbe frank with me.\u201d I lied. I declared to her that she must first listen to a confession, that of my passionate admiration, for some time past, of Andr\u00e9e, and I made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage, but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel. Harking back to the fiction I had employed with Gilberte before my first visit to Balbec, but adapting its terms, I went so far (in order to make her more ready to believe me when I told her now that I was not in love with her) as to let fall the admission that at one time I had been on the point of falling in love with her, but that too long an interval had elapsed, that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade, and that even if I wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power. As it happened, in taking my stand thus before Albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her, I was merely \u2014 because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view \u2014 making more perceptible, accentuating more markedly, that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them, and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her. They know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes, the same agonies, invented the same romances, uttered the same words, to have deduced therefore that their sentiments, their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love, but pass by her, spatter her, surround her, like the waves that break round upon the rocks, and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman, by whom they would so fain be loved, is not in love with them. Why should chance have brought it about, when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire, that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her? And so, while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments, so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us, those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover\u2019s, after we have taken a step forward, in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her, our hopes, overcome at once by the fear of offending her, ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her, that it has served us already, will serve us again for others, that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste, of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them, this fear, this shame bring into play the counter-rhythm, the reflux, the need, even by first drawing back, hotly denying the affection we have already confessed, to resume the offensive, and to recapture her esteem, to dominate her; the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair, in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs, in all those people whose self-analysis outweighs their self-esteem. If it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which I was now preparing to make to Albertine, that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though it must be painful to Albertine to believe what I was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again, after so long an interval, I justified what I called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom I had, by their fault or my own, allowed the time for loving them to pass, and been unable, however keenly I might have desired it, to recapture it. I thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her, as for a want of courtesy, for this inability to begin loving her again, and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself. But by explaining myself in this fashion, by dwelling upon the case of Gilberte, in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to Albertine, all that I did was to render my assertions as plausible as I pretended to believe that they were not. Feeling that Albertine appreciated what she called my \u2018frank speech\u2019 and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence, I apologised for the former by telling her that I knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible. She, on the contrary, thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This avowal to Albertine of an imaginary sentiment for Andr\u00e9e, and, towards herself, an indifference which, that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration, I assured her incidentally, as though by a scruple of politeness, must not be taken too literally, enabled me at length, without any fear of Albertine\u2019s suspecting me of loving her, to speak to her with a tenderness which I had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite. I almost caressed my confidant; as I spoke to her of her friend whom I loved, tears came to my eyes. But, coming at last to the point, I said to her that she knew what love meant, its susceptibilities, its sufferings, and that perhaps, as the old friend that she now was, she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me, not directly, since it was not herself that I loved, if I might venture to repeat that without offending her, but indirectly by wounding me in my love for Andr\u00e9e. I broke off to admire and point out to Albertine a great bird, solitary and hastening, which far out in front of us, lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings, was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper, and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace, without diverting its attention, without deviating from its path, like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message. \u201cHe at least goes straight to the point!\u201d said Albertine in a tone of reproach. \u201cYou say that because you don\u2019t know what it is I was going to tell you. But it is so difficult that I prefer to give it up; I am certain that I should make you angry; and then all that will have happened will be this: I shall be in no way better off with the girl I really love and I shall have lost a good friend.\u201d \u201cBut when I swear to you that I will not be angry.\u201d She had so sweet, so wistfully docile an air, as though her whole happiness depended on me, that I could barely restrain myself from kissing \u2014 with almost the same kind of pleasure that I should have taken in kissing my mother \u2014 this novel face which no longer presented the startled, blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink, tip-tilted nose, but seemed, in the fulness of its crushing sorrow, moulded in broad, flattened, drooping slabs of pure goodness. Making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her, putting myself in her place, I let my heart be melted before this honest girl, accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion, whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point. It was because I placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human, external to both of us, at which my jealous love dissolved, that I felt for Albertine that profound pity, which would have been less profound if I had not loved her. However, in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel (the surest, the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm), of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity, which, the opposite of love, though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause, produces in every case the same effects? When we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman, we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her, to make her love us, to win her favours, bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love, from a mere sense of moral duty, as though we were not in love with her. \u201cBut tell me, what on earth have I done?\u201d Albertine asked me. There was a knock at the door; it was the lift-boy; Albertine\u2019s aunt, who was passing the hotel in a carriage, had stopped on the chance of finding her there, to take her home. Albertine sent word that she could not come, that they were to begin dinner without her, that she could not say at what time she would return. \u201cBut won\u2019t your aunt be angry?\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose? She will understand all right.\u201d And so, at this moment at least, a moment such as might never occur again \u2014 a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in Albertine\u2019s eyes a thing of such self-evident importance that it must be given precedence over everything, a thing to which, referring no doubt instinctively to a family code, enumerating certain crises in which, when the career of M. Bontemps was at stake, a journey had been made without a thought, my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinner-hour. That remote hour which she passed without my company, among her own people, Albertine, having brought it to me, bestowed it on me; I might make what use of it I chose. I ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living, and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that I felt for women tainted with that vice, I had not given it a thought until I had been told the name of her accomplice, and that she could readily understand, loving Andr\u00e9e as I did, the grief that, the news had caused me. It would have been more tactful perhaps to say that I had been given the names of other women as well, in whom I was not interested. But the sudden and terrible revelation that Cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it, complete in itself but without accretions. And just as, before that moment, it would never have occurred to me that Albertine was in love with Andr\u00e9e, or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her, if Cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together, so I had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea, so different for me, that Albertine might have, with other women than Andr\u00e9e, relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse. Albertine, before even swearing to me that it was not true, shewed, like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him, anger, concern, and, with regard to the unknown slanderer, a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him. But she assured me that she bore me, at least, no resentment. \u201cIf it had been true, I should have told you. But Andr\u00e9e and I both loathe that sort of thing. We have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean, and nothing revolts us more.\u201d Albertine gave me merely her word, a peremptory word unsupported by proof. But this was just what was best calculated to calm me, jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation. It is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous, to make us suspect, more readily than we should suspect anyone else, her whom we love, and be convinced more easily by her denials. We must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous, which is to say before we can be aware of the fact, and we must be in love too before we can hope, that is to say assure ourselves that some are. It is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it. The statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true, we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts. Besides, however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love, she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours, or as turning her desires in another direction. The former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other, the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us. The beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it. No doubt, I had long since been prepared, by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of Swann, to believe in the truth of what I feared rather than of what I should have wished. And so the comfort brought me by Albertine\u2019s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment, because I was reminded of the story of Odette. But I told myself that, if it was only right to allow for the worst, not only when, in order to understand Swann\u2019s sufferings, I had tried to put myself in his place, but now, when I myself was concerned, in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else, still I must not, out of cruelty to myself, a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed, end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest, simply because it was more painful. Was there not a vast gulf between Albertine, a girl of good, middle-class parentage, and Odette, a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood? There could be no comparison of their respective credibility. Besides, Albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that Odette had had in lying to Swann. Moreover to him Odette had admitted what Albertine had just denied. I should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious \u2014 though in the opposite direction \u2014 as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest, were I not to take into account these material differences in their positions, but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what I had been told about the life of Odette. I had before me a new Albertine, of whom I had already, it was true, caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to Balbec, frank and honest, an Albertine who had, out of affection for myself, forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them. She made me sit down by her side upon my bed. I thanked her for what she had said to me, assured her that our reconciliation was complete, and that I would never be horrid to her again. I suggested to her that she ought, at the same time, to go home to dinner. She asked me whether I was not glad to have her with me. Drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which I owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture, she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart. At first I kept them tight shut. \u201cYou are a great bear!\u201d she informed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again. I felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated \u2014 I might as well say, in love, for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love \u2014 we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman\u2019s good nature, or her caprice, or mere chance, bring to our desires, in perfect coincidence, the same words, the same actions as if we were really loved. The wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity, to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which I should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured; to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me, and \u2014 lest the next day should expose this fiction \u2014 not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this, which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment. I ought to have left Balbec, to have shut myself up in solitude, to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which I had contrived to render amorous for an instant, and of which I should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me; for fear lest, by an additional word which now could only be different, it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which, as though by the pressure of a pedal, there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soothed by my explanation with Albertine, I began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother. She loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger. Fearing that I might reproach myself with the sorrows with which I had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother\u2019s life, she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me. We talked of the old days at Combray. My mother reminded me that there at least I used to read, and that at Balbec I might well do the same, if I was not going to work. I replied that, to surround myself with memories of Combray and of the charming coloured plates, I should like to read again the Thousand and One Nights. As, long ago at Combray, when she gave me books for my birthday, so it was in secret, as a surprise for me, that my mother now sent for both the Thousand and One Nights of Galland and the Thousand Nights and a Night of Mardrus. But, after casting her eye over the two translations, my mother would have preferred that I should stick to Galland\u2019s, albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty, her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that, being a woman, on the one hand she lacked, or so she thought, the necessary literary equipment, and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man. Happening upon certain of the tales, she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression. But above all, preserving, like precious relics, not only the brooch, the sunshade, the cloak, the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother, seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed, my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned Mardrus\u2019s book. She remembered that at Combray while before setting out for a walk, M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was reading Augustin Thierry, my grandmother, glad that I should be reading, and taking walks, was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich: \u2018Then reign\u00e8d M\u00e9rov\u00e9e\u2019 called Merowig, refused to say \u2018Carolingians\u2019 for the \u2018Carlovingians\u2019 to which she remained loyal. And then I told her what my grandmother had thought of the Greek names which Bloch, following Leconte de Lisle, gave to the gods of Homer, going so far, in the simplest matters, as to make it a religious duty, in which he supposed literary talent to consist, to adopt a Greek system of spelling. Having occasion, for instance, to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar, he would write \u2018real nektar,\u2019 with a k, which enabled him to titter at the mention of Lamartine. And if an Odyssey from which the names of Ulysses and Minerva were missing was no longer the Odyssey to her, what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her Thousand and One Nights, upon no longer finding, exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them, the immortally familiar names of Scheherazade, of Dinarzade, in which, debaptised themselves (if one may use the expression of Musulman tales), the charming Caliph and the powerful Genies were barely recognisable, being renamed, he the \u2018Khalifat\u2019 and they the \u2018Gennis.\u2019 Still, my mother handed over both books to me, and I told her that I would read them on the days when I. felt too tired to go out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days were not very frequent, however. We used to go out picnicking as before in a band, Albertine, her friends and myself, on the cliff or to the farm called Marie-Antoinette. But there were times when Albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure. She would say to me: \u201cTo-day I want to be alone with you for a little, it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves.\u201d Then she would give out that she was busy, not that she need furnish any explanation, and so that the others, if they went all the same, without us, for an excursion and picnic, might not be able to find us, we would steal away like a pair of lovers, all by ourselves to Bagatelle or the Cross of Heulan, while the band, who would never think of looking for us there and never went there, waited indefinitely, in the hope of seeing us appear, at Marie-Antoinette. I recall the hot weather that we had then, when from the brow of each of the farm-labourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall, vertical, regular, intermittent, like the drop of water from a cistern, and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining \u2018closes\u2019; they have remained, to this day, with that mystery of a woman\u2019s secret, the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me. A woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom I would not give a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 I upset all my week\u2019s engagements to make her acquaintance, if it is a week of similar weather, and I am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse. It is no good my knowing that this kind of weather, this kind of assignation are not part of her, they are still the bait, which I know all too well, by which I allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me. I know that this woman, in cold weather, in a town, I might perhaps have desired, but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment, without becoming amorous; my love for her is none the less keen as soon as, by force of circumstances, it has enthralled me \u2014 it is only the more melancholy, as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become, in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent, cut short in the same moment as life itself, will be the last\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were still but a few people at Balbec, hardly any girls. Sometimes I saw some girl resting upon the beach, devoid of charm, and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom I had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium. If it was the same (and I took care not to mention the matter to Albertine), then the girl that I had thought so exciting did not exist. But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach, did not offer a permanent form, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own observation, the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was self-sufficient, by the different clothes that she was wearing, the rapidity of her movements or her immobility. All the same, two or three of them seemed to me adorable. Whenever I saw one of these, I longed to take her away along the Avenue des Tamaris, or among the sandhills, better still upon the cliff. But, albeit into desire, as opposed to indifference, there enters already that audacity which is a first stage, if only unilateral, towards realisation, all the same, between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been, there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation, of timidity. Then I went into the pastrycook\u2019s bar, I drank, one after another, seven or eight glasses of port wine. At once, instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action, the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together. No longer was there any room for hesitation or fear. It seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms. I went up to her, the words came spontaneously to my lips: \u201cI should like to go for a walk with you. You wouldn\u2019t care to go along the cliff, we shan\u2019t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now?\u201d All the difficulties of life were smoothed away, there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies. No obstacle for me, at least. For they had not been volatilised for her, who had not been drinking port wine. Had she done so, had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes, the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet \u2018the season\u2019 they stayed but a short time. There is one I remember with a reddish skin, green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks, whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees. I cannot say what breeze wafted her to Balbec or what other bore her away. So sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards I was haunted by a grief which I made bold to confess to Albertine when I realised that the girl had gone for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that several of them were either girls whom I did not know at all or whom I had not seen for years. Often, before addressing them, I wrote to them. If their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love, what joy! We cannot, at the outset of our friendship with a woman, even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing, bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her. We like to have them beside us all the time, like a present of rare flowers, still quite fresh, at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them. The sentence that we know by heart, it is pleasant to read again, and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression. Did she write: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019? A slight marring of our bliss, which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly, or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent; she did not say: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019 but \u2018From your letter.\u2019 But the rest is so tender. Oh, that more such flowers may come to-morrow. Then that is no longer enough, we must with the written words compare the writer\u2019s eyes, her face. We make an appointment, and \u2014 without her having altered, perhaps \u2014 whereas we expected, from the description given us or our personal memory, to meet the fairy Viviane, we encounter Puss-in-Boots. We make an appointment, nevertheless, for the following day, for it is, after all, she, and the person we desired is she. And these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential. These desires are only the desire for a certain person; vague as perfumes, as styrax was the desire of Prothyraia, saffron the ethereal desire, aromatic scents the desire of Hera, myrrh the perfume of the Magi, manna the desire of Nike, incense the perfume of the sea. But these perfumes that are sung in the Orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship. Myrrh is the perfume of the Magi, but also of Protogonos, Neptune, Nereus, Leto; incense is the perfume of the sea, but also of the fair Dike, of Themis, of Circe, of the Nine Muses, of Eos, of Mnemosyne, of the Day, of Dikaiosyne. As for styrax, manna and aromatic scents, it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them, so many are they. Amphietes has all the perfumes except incense, and Gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents. So was it with these desires for different girls that I felt. Fewer in number than the girls themselves, they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another. I never wished for myrrh. I reserved it for Jupien and for the Prince de Guermantes, for it is the desire of Protogonos \u201cof twofold sex, who roars like a bull, of countless orgies, memorable, unspeakable, descending, joyous, to the sacrifices of the Orgiophants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the season was in full swing; every day there was some fresh arrival, and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings, which took the place of the charmed perusal of the Thousand and One Nights, there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all. The beach was now peopled with girls, and, since the idea suggested to me by Cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind, as soon as a young woman arrived at Balbec, I began to feel ill at ease, I proposed to Albertine the most distant excursions, in order that she might not make the newcomer\u2019s acquaintance, and indeed, if possible, might not set eyes on her. I dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known; I tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation, was a slander, perhaps, without admitting it to myself, from a fear, still unconscious, that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so, because of me, or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned. In denying the guilt of each of them, my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist. Albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s just a pose, she wants to look the part.\u201d But then, I regretted almost that I had pleaded the other\u2019s innocence, for it distressed me that Albertine, formerly so severe, could believe that this \u2018part\u2019 was a thing so flattering, so advantageous, that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to \u2018look it.\u2019 I would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to Balbec; I trembled when I thought that, as it was almost time for Mme. Putbus to arrive at the Verdurins\u2019, her maid, whose tastes Saint-Loup had not concealed from me, might take it into her head to come down to the beach, and, if it were a day on which I was not with Albertine, might seek to corrupt her. I went the length of asking myself whether, as Cottard had made no secret of the fact that the Verdurins thought highly of me and, while not wishing to appear, as he put it, to be running after me, would give a great deal to have me come to their house, I might not, on the strength of promises to bring all the Guermantes in existence to call on them in Paris, induce Mme. Verdurin, upon some pretext or other, to inform Mme. Putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once. Notwithstanding these thoughts, and as it was chiefly the presence of Andr\u00e9e that was disturbing me, the soothing effect that Albertine\u2019s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted \u2014 I knew moreover that presently I should have less need of it, as Andr\u00e9e would be leaving the place with Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with Albertine. During these weeks, moreover, Albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did, everything that she said, with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained, or to prevent them from reviving. She contrived never to be left alone with Andr\u00e9e, and insisted, when we came back from an excursion, upon my accompanying her to her door, upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere. Andr\u00e9e meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side, seemed to avoid meeting Albertine. And this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that Albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time there occurred at the Grand Hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment. Bloch\u2019s cousin had for some time past been indulging, with a retired actress, in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them. That they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure, they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world. They began with caresses, which might, after all, be set down to a friendly intimacy, in the card-room, by the baccarat-table. Then they grew more bold. And finally, one evening, in a corner that was not even dark of the big ball-room, on a sofa, they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed. Two officers who happened to be near, with their wives, complained to the manager. It was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective. But they had this against them that, having come over for the evening from Netteholme, where they were staying, they could not be of any use to the manager. Whereas, without her knowing it even, and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her, there hovered over Mlle. Bloch the protection of M. Nissim Bernard. I must explain why. M. Nissim Bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues. Every year he took a magnificent villa at Balbec for his nephew, and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table, which was in reality theirs. But he never took his luncheon at home. Every day at noon he was at the Grand Hotel. The fact of the matter was that he was keeping, as other men keep a chorus-girl from the opera, an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken, and who made us think of the young Israelites inEsther and Athalie. It is true that the forty years\u2019 difference in age between M. Nis-sim Bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant. But, as Racine so wisely observes in those same choruses:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great God, with what uncertain tread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A budding virtue \u2018mid such perils goes!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What stumbling-blocks do lie before a soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seeks Thee and would fain be innocent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young waiter might indeed have been brought up \u2018remote from the world\u2019 in the Temple-Caravanserai of Balbec, he had not followed the advice of Joad:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In riches and in gold put not thy trust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had perhaps justified himself by saying: \u201cThe wicked cover the earth.\u201d However that might be, and albeit M. Nissim Bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest, on the very first day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were\u2019t in alarm, or anxious to caress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt those childish arms about him thrown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the second day, M. Nissim Bernard having taken the young waiter out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dire assault his innocence destroyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment the boy\u2019s life was altered. He might indeed carry bread and salt, as his superior bade him, his whole face sang:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From flowers to flowers, from joys to keener joys\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let our desires now range\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncertain is our tale of fleeting years\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haste we then to enjoy this life!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honours and fame are the reward\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of blind and meek obedience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For moping innocence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now would raise his voice!\n\nSince that day, M. Nissim Bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheon-table (as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer, a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type, which still awaits its Degas). It was M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned, the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service, in the service of everyone, and, less than anyone, of M. Nissim Bernard, now that the latter was keeping him, whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved, or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest, if discovered, it might make him lose other opportunities. But this very coldness pleased M. Nissim Bernard, because of all that it concealed; whether from Hebraic atavism or from profanation of the Christian spirit, he took a singular pleasure, were it Jewish or Catholic, in the Racinian ceremony. Had it been a real performance of Esther or Athalie, M. Bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author, Jean Racine, so that he might obtain for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a more substantial part. But as the luncheon ceremony came from no author\u2019s pen, he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and Aim\u00e9, so that the \u2018young Israelite\u2019 might be promoted to the coveted post of under-waiter, or even full waiter to a row of tables. The post of wine waiter had been offered him. But M. Bernard made him decline it, for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green dining-room and to be waited upon by him like a stranger. Now this pleasure was so keen that every year M. Bernard returned to Balbec and took his luncheon away from home, habits in which M. Bloch saw, in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine, the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others, in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the mistake made by M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s relatives, who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to Balbec and for what the pedantic Mme. Bloch called his absentee palate, was really a more profound and secondary truth. For M. Nissim Bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at Balbec, for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea, and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping, like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a Degas, one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls. And so M. Nissim Bernard maintained, with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at Balbec, and with the stage-manager and producer Aim\u00e9\u2014 whose part in all this affair was anything but simple \u2014 excellent relations. One day they would intrigue to procure an important part, a place perhaps as headwaiter. In the meantime M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s pleasure, poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be, reminded one a little of those women-loving men who always know \u2014 Swann, for example, in the past \u2014 that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress. No sooner had M. Nissim Bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene, bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray. And so every morning, after kissing his niece, bothering my friend Bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand, he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the Grand Hotel. Had the house been on fire, had his niece had a stroke, he would doubtless have started off just the same. So that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed \u2014 for he was a hypochondriac \u2014 and would oblige him to ask Aim\u00e9 to send his young friend across to visit him at home, between luncheon and tea-time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors, private offices, reception-rooms, cloakrooms, larders, galleries which composed the hotel at Balbec. With a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio, and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages. While, venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal, M. Nissim Bernard, in his quest of the young L\u00e9vites, put one in mind of those lines in La Juive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O God of our Fathers, come down to us again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to Balbec, as her maids, with an old lady, a foreigner. They were what the language of hotels called \u2018couriers,\u2019 and that of Fran\u00e7oise, who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course, two \u2018coursers.\u2019 The hotels have remained, more nobly, in the period when people sang: \u201cC\u2019est un courrier de cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants\u2019 quarters, I had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship, as strong as it was pure, with these two young persons, Mademoiselle Marie Gineste and Madame C\u00e9leste Albaret. Born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of France, on the banks of rivulets and torrents (the water passed actually under their old home, turning a millwheel, and the house had often been damaged by floods), they seemed to embody the features of that region. Marie Gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt, C\u00e9leste Albaret softer and more languishing, spread out like a lake, but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them. They often came in the morning to see me when I was still in bed. I have never known people so deliberately ignorant, who had learned absolutely nothing at school, and yet whose language was somehow so literary that, but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone, one would have thought their speech affected. With a familiarity which I reproduce verbatim, notwithstanding the praises (which I set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of C\u00e9leste) and the criticisms, equally unfounded, in which her remarks seem to involve me, while I dipped crescent rolls in my milk, C\u00e9leste would say to me: \u201cOh! Little black devil with hair of jet, O profound wickedness! I don\u2019t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you, for you are just like a bird. Look, Marie, wouldn\u2019t you say he was preening his feathers, and turning his head right round, so light he looks, you would say he was just learning to fly. Ah! It\u2019s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches; what would ever have become of you, so wasteful as you are. Look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed. There he goes, now, look, he\u2019s spilling his milk, wait till I tie a napkin round you, for you could never do it for yourself, never in my life have I seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you.\u201d I would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of Marie Gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister: \u201cWill you hold your tongue, now, C\u00e9leste. Are you mad, talking to Monsieur like that?\u201d C\u00e9leste merely smiled; and as I detested having a napkin tied round my neck: \u201cNo, Marie, look at him, bang, he\u2019s shot straight up on end like a serpent. A proper serpent, I tell you.\u201d These were but a few of her zoological similes, for, according to her, it was impossible to tell when I slept, I fluttered about all night like a butterfly, and in the day time I was as swift as the squirrels. \u201cYou know, Marie, the way we see them at home, so nimble that even with your eyes you can\u2019t follow them.\u201d \u201cBut, C\u00e9leste, you know he doesn\u2019t like having a napkin when he\u2019s eating.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will. He\u2019s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is. They can change the sheets ten times over, if they must, but he won\u2019t give way. Yesterday\u2019s had served their time, but to-day they have only just been put on the bed and they\u2019ll have to be changed already. Oh, I was right when I said that he was never meant to be born among the poor. Look, his hair\u2019s standing on end, swelling with rage like a bird\u2019s feathers. Poor ploumissou!\u201d Here it was not only Marie that protested, but myself, for I did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman. But C\u00e9leste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short. \u201cOh! The story-teller! Oh! The flatterer! Oh! The false one! The cunning rogue! Oh! Moli\u00e8re!\u201d (This was the only writer\u2019s name that she knew, but she applied it to me, meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them.) \u201cC\u00e9leste!\u201d came the imperious cry from Marie, who, not knowing the name of Moli\u00e8re, was afraid that it might be some fresh insult. C\u00e9leste continued to smile: \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen the photograph of him in his drawer, when he was little. He tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply. And there, with his little cane, he\u2019s all furs and laces, such as no Prince ever wore. But that\u2019s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d scolded the torrent Marie, \u201cyou go rummaging in his drawers now, do you?\u201d To calm Marie\u2019s fears I asked her what she thought of M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s behaviour. . . . \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are things I wouldn\u2019t have believed could exist. One has to come here to learn.\u201d And, for once outrivalling C\u00e9leste by an even more profound observation: \u201cAh! You see, Monsieur, one can never tell what there may be in a person\u2019s life.\u201d To change the subject, I spoke to her of the life led by my father, who toiled night and day. \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves, not one minute, not one pleasure, the whole thing is a sacrifice for others, they are lives that are given away.\u201d \u201cLook, Marie, he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent, what distinction. He can do the most insignificant things, you would say that the whole nobility of France, from here to the Pyrenees, was stirring in each of his movements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike, I remained silent; C\u00e9leste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile: \u201cOh! Brow that looks so pure, and hides so many things, nice, cool cheeks like the inside of an almond, little hands of satin all velvety, nails like claws,\u201d and so forth. \u201cThere, Marie, look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers. What a serious air! They ought really to take his portrait as he is just now. He\u2019s just like a child. Is it drinking milk, like them, that has kept you their bright colour? Oh! Youth! Oh! Lovely skin. You will never grow old. You are a lucky one, you will never need to raise your hand against anyone, for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done. Look at him now, he\u2019s angry. He shoots up, straight as a sign-post.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise did not at all approve of what she called the two \u2018tricksters\u2019 coming to talk to me like this. The manager, who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on, even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants. I, who found the \u2018tricksters\u2019 far better than any visitor in the hotel, merely laughed in his face, convinced that he would not understand my explanations. And the sisters returned. \u201cLook, Marie, at his delicate lines. Oh, perfect miniature, finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case, for he can move, and utters words you could listen to for days and nights.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there, for, without knowing anything of history or geography, they heartily detested the English, the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, all foreign vermin, and cared, with certain exceptions, for French people alone. Their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds, that, as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel, in order to repeat what he had said, C\u00e9leste and Marie imposed upon their faces his face, their mouths became his mouth, their eyes his eyes, one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks. C\u00e9leste indeed, while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said, or one of my friends, would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of Bloch, the chief magistrate, etc., while apparently unconscious of doing so. It was, under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey, an inimitable portrait. They never read anything, not even a newspaper. One day, however, they found lying on my bed a book. It was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of Saint-L\u00e9ger L\u00e9ger. C\u00e9leste read a few pages and said to me: \u201cBut are you quite sure that these are poetry, wouldn\u2019t they just be riddles?\u201d Obviously, to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem: \u201cDown here the lilacs die,\u201d there was a gap in evolution. I fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home. They had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew. For if C\u00e9leste had said something noteworthy and, unable to remember it correctly, I asked her to repeat it, she would assure me that she had forgotten. They will never read any books, but neither will they ever write any\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married, one the niece of the Archbishop of Tours, the other a relative of the Bishop of Rodez. To the manager, this would have conveyed nothing. C\u00e9leste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her, and as for me, I was astonished that he could endure her. For at certain moments, raging, furious, destroying everything, she was detestable. It is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element. Similarly, I believe that C\u00e9leste, not only in her bursts of fury, but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams. When she was exhausted, it was after their fashion; she had literally run dry. Nothing could then have revived her. Then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body, splendid and light. The water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin. She smiled at the sun and became bluer still. At such moments she was truly celestial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor, due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress; everything that concerned M. Nissim Bernard was tabu to the manager of the Balbec hotel. And that was why, without even referring to the uncle, he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece, albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect. And so the girl and her friend who, for some days, had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the Grand Hotel, seeing that everything was settled, were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties. No doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody. But gradually they returned to their old ways. And one evening as I came out of the casino which was half in darkness with Albertine and Bloch whom we had met there, they came towards us, linked together, kissing each other incessantly, and, as they passed us, crowed and laughed, uttering indecent cries. Bloch lowered his eyes, so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin, and as for myself I was tortured by the thought that this occult, appalling language was addressed perhaps to Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of Gomorrah. I had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman, erect and pale, whose eyes, round their centre, scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded, on meeting her gaze, of some constellation. I thought how much more beautiful this girl was than Albertine, and that it would be wiser to give up the other. Only, the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life, of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients, so much so that her eyes, more noble however than the rest of her face, could radiate nothing but appetites and desires. Well, on the following day, this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino, I saw that she never ceased to fasten upon Albertine the alternate, circling fires of her gaze. One would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse. I dreaded my friend\u2019s seeing that she was being so closely observed, I was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow. For all I knew, this assignation might not be the first. The young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to Balbec. It was perhaps because Albertine had already yielded to her desires, or to those of a friend, that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals. If so, they did more than demand something for the present, they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This assignation, in that case, must be not the first, but the sequel to adventures shared in past years. And indeed her glance did not say: \u201cWill you?\u201d As soon as the young woman had caught sight of Albertine, she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection, as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember. Albertine, who could see her plainly, remained phlegmatically motionless, with the result that the other, with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover, ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, a day or two later, I received a proof of this young woman\u2019s tendencies, and also of the probability of her having known Albertine in the past. Often, in the hall of the casino, when two girls were smitten with mutual desire, a luminous phenomenon occurred, a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other. Let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations, even if they be imponderable, by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere, that the scattered Gomorrah tends, in every town, in every village, to reunite its separated members, to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made, be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction, by the nostalgic, the hypocritical, sometimes by the courageous exiles from Sodom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once I saw the stranger whom Albertine had appeared not to recognise, just at the moment when Bloch\u2019s cousin was approaching her. The young woman\u2019s eyes flashed, but it was quite evident that she did not know the Israelite maiden. She beheld her for the first time, felt a desire, a shadow of doubt, by no means the same certainty as in the case of Albertine, Albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that, in the face of her coldness, she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with Paris but not resident there, who, having returned to spend a few weeks there, on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings, sees that they have now built a bank\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine. Presently the young woman came and sat down, with an abstracted air, by her side. But under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling, then their legs and hands, in a confused heap. Words followed, a conversation began, and the young woman\u2019s innocent husband, who had been looking everywhere for her, was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know. His wife introduced Bloch\u2019s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood, by an inaudible name, for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was. But the husband\u2019s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther, for they addressed each other as tu, having known each other at their convent, an incident at which they laughed heartily later on, as well as at the hoodwinked husband, with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Albertine, I cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free. I found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding, to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion. When questioned by some girl, she had a quick, icy, decent way of replying in a very loud voice: \u201cYes, I shall be going to the tennis court about five. I shall bathe to-morrow morning about eight,\u201d and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this \u2014 all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent, and either to make an assignation, or, the assignation already made in a whisper, to utter this speech, harmless enough in itself, aloud, so as not to attract attention. And when later on I saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance, I could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motor-car at the end of the beach, Albertine could not help turning round. And she at once explained: \u201cI was looking at the new flag they\u2019ve put up over the bathing place. The old one was pretty moth-eaten. But I really think this one is mouldier still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion Albertine was not content with cold indifference, and this made me all the more wretched. She knew that I was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt, who had a \u2018bad style\u2019 and came now and again to spend a few days with Mme. Bontemps. Albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again. And when this woman came to Incarville, Albertine said: \u201cBy the way, you know she\u2019s here. Have they told you?\u201d as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret. One day, when she told me this, she added: \u201cYes, I ran into her on the beach, and knocked against her as I passed, on purpose, to be rude to her.\u201d When Albertine told me this, there came back to my mind a remark made by Mme. Bontemps, to which I had never given a second thought, when she had said to Mme. Swann in my presence how brazen her niece Albertine was, as though that were a merit, and told her how Albertine had reminded some official\u2019s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen. But a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity; it withers, it decays. An evening or two later, I thought again of Albertine\u2019s remark, and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud \u2014 and which could only make me smile \u2014 that it seemed to me to signify, it was something else, to wit that Albertine, perhaps even without any definite object, to irritate this woman\u2019s senses, or wantonly to remind her of former proposals, accepted perhaps in the past, had swiftly brushed against her, thought that I had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public, and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom Albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting, Albertine and I, at the Balbec station of the little local railway. We had driven there in the hotel omnibus, because it was raining. Not far away from us was M. Nissim Bernard, with a black eye. He had recently forsaken the chorister from Athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood, known as the \u2018Cherry Orchard.\u2019 This rubicund youth, with his blunt features, appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head. A tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother. To the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins, that nature, becoming for the moment industrialised, seems to be offering a pattern for sale. Unfortunately M. Nissim Bernard looked at it from another point of view, and this resemblance was only external. Tomato II shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies, Tomato I did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen. Now on each occasion when, stirred, as though by a reflex action, by the memory of pleasant hours spent with Tomato I, M. Bernard presented himself at the Cherry Orchard, being short-sighted (not that one need be short-sighted to mistake them), the old Israelite, unconsciously playing Amphitryon, would accost the twin brother with: \u201cWill you meet me somewhere this evening?\u201d He at once received a resounding smack in the face. It might even be repeated in the course of a single meal, when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first. In the end this treatment so disgusted him, by association of ideas, with tomatoes, even of the edible variety, that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable, at the next table to his own, in the Grand Hotel, he would murmur to him: \u201cYou must excuse me, Sir, for addressing you, without an introduction. But I heard you order tomatoes. They are stale to-day. I tell you in your own interest, for it makes no difference to me, I never touch them myself.\u201d The stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour, call back the waiter, pretend to have changed his mind: \u201cNo, on second thoughts, certainly not, no tomatoes.\u201d Aim\u00e9, who had seen it all before, would laugh to himself, and think: \u201cHe\u2019s an old rascal, that Monsieur Bernard, he\u2019s gone and made another of them change his order.\u201d M. Bernard, as he waited for the already overdue tram, shewed no eagerness to speak to Albertine and myself, because of his black eye. We were even less eager to speak to him. It would however have been almost inevitable if, at that moment, a bicycle had not come dashing towards us; the lift-boy sprang from its saddle, breathless. Madame Verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel, to know whether I would dine with her two days later; we shall see presently why. Then, having given me the message in detail, the lift-boy left us, and, being one of these democratic \u2018employees\u2019 who affect independence with regard to the middle classes, and among themselves restore the principle of authority, explained: \u201cI must be off, because of my chiefs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine\u2019s girl friends had gone, and would be away for some time. I was anxious to provide her with distractions. Even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own, at Balbec, I knew that such happiness is never complete, and that Albertine, being still at the age (which some of us never outgrow) when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it, might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself. I preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which, arranged by myself, would not give us an opportunity of being alone together, while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me. And so I had asked her that day to come with me to Donci\u00e8res, where I was going to meet Saint-Loup. With a similar hope of occupying her mind, I advised her to take up painting, in which she had had lessons in the past. While working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy. I would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the Verdurins and the Cambremers, who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself, but I must first make certain that Mme. Putbus was not yet at la Raspeli\u00e8re. It was only by going there in person that I could make sure of this, and, as I knew beforehand that on the next day but one Albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt, I had seized this opportunity to send Mme. Verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon Wednesday. If Mme. Putbus was there, I would manage to see her maid, ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to Balbec, and if so find out when, so as to take Albertine out of reach on the day. The little local railway, making a loop which did not exist at the time when I had taken it with my grandmother, now extended to Donci\u00e8res-la-Goupil, a big station at which important trains stopped, among them the express by which I had come down to visit Saint-Loup, from Paris, and the corresponding express by which I had returned. And, because of the bad weather, the omnibus from the Grand Hotel took Albertine and myself to the station of the little tram, Balbec-Plage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The little train had not yet arrived, but one could see, lazy and slow, the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake, which, confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud, was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of Criquetot. Finally the little tram, which it had preceded by taking a vertical course, arrived in its turn, at a leisurely crawl. The passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it, but without hurrying, knowing that they were dealing with a good-natured, almost human traveller, who, guided like the bicycle of a beginner, by the obliging signals of the station-master, in the strong hands of the engine-driver, was in no danger of running over anybody, and would come to a halt at the proper place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My telegram explained the Verdurins\u2019 telephone message and had been all the more opportune since Wednesday (the day I had fixed happened to be a Wednesday) was the day set apart for dinner-parties by Mme. Verdurin, at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as in Paris, a fact of which I was unaware. Mme. Verdurin did not give \u2018dinners,\u2019 but she had \u2018Wednesdays.\u2019 These Wednesdays were works of art. While fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere, Mme. Verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them. \u201cLast Wednesday was not as good as the one before,\u201d she would say. \u201cBut I believe the next will be one of the best I have ever given.\u201d Sometimes she went so far as to admit: \u201cThis Wednesday was not worthy of the others. But I have a big surprise for you next week.\u201d In the closing weeks of the Paris season, before leaving for the country, the Mistress would announce the end of the Wednesdays. It gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful. \u201cThere are only three more Wednesdays left, there are only two more,\u201d she would say, in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to miss next Wednesday, for the finale.\u201d But this finale was a sham, for she would announce: \u201cOfficially, there will be no more Wednesdays. To-day was the last for this year. But I shall be at home all the same on Wednesday. We shall have a little Wednesday to ourselves; I dare say these little private Wednesdays will be the nicest of all.\u201d At la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Wednesdays were of necessity restricted, and since, if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way, they would invite him for one or another evening, almost every day of the week became a Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember all the guests, but I know there\u2019s Madame la Marquise de Camembert,\u201d the liftboy had told me; his memory of our discussion of the name Cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world, whose syllables, familiar and full of meaning, came to the young employee\u2019s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name, and were immediately preferred and readopted by him, not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage, but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hastened in search of an empty carriage in which I could hold Alber-tine in my arms throughout the journey. Having failed to find one, we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face, old and ugly, with a masculine expression, very much in her Sunday best, who was reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. Notwithstanding her commonness, she was eclectic in her tastes, and I found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong; I at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel, a procuress on holiday. Her face, her manner, proclaimed the fact aloud. Only, I had never yet supposed that such ladies read the Revue des Deux Mondes. Albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile. The lady wore an air of extreme dignity; and as I, for my part, bore within me the consciousness that I was invited, two days later, to the terminal point of the little railway, by the famous Mme. Verdurin, that at an intermediate station I was awaited by Robert de Saint-Loup, and that a little farther on I had it in my power to give great pleasure to Mme. de Cambremer, by going to stay at F\u00e9terne, my eyes sparkled with irony as I studied this self-important lady who seemed to think that, because of her elaborate attire, the feathers in her hat, her Revue des Deux Mondes, she was a more considerable personage than myself. I hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than M. Nissim Bernard, and that she would alight at least at Toutainville, but no. The train stopped at Evreville, she remained seated. Similarly at Montmartin-sur-Mer, at Parville-la-Bingard, at Incarville, so that in despair, when the train had left Saint-Frichoux, which was the last station before Donci\u00e8res, I began to embrace Albertine without bothering about the lady. At Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Loup had come to meet me at the station, with the greatest difficulty, he told me, for, as he was staying with his aunt, my telegram had only just reached him and he could not, having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand, spare me more than an hour of his time. This hour seemed to me, alas, far too long, for as soon as we had left the train Albertine devoted her whole attention to Saint-Loup. She never talked to me, barely answered me if I addressed her, repulsed me when I approached her. With Robert, on the other hand, she laughed her provoking laugh, talked to him volubly, played with the dog he had brought with him, and, as she excited the animal, deliberately rubbed against its master. I remembered that, on the day when Albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time, I had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task. I thought of him now with horror. Robert must have noticed that I was not unconcerned about Albertine, for he offered no response to her provocations, which made her extremely annoyed with myself; then he spoke to me as though I had been alone, which, when she realised it, raised me again in her esteem. Robert asked me if I would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at Donci\u00e8res, when I was staying there, who were still in the garrison. And as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others: \u201cWhat is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don\u2019t want to see them again?\u201d I declined his offer, for I did not wish to run any risk of being parted from Albertine, but also because now I was detached from them. From them, which is to say from myself. We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally. Even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime, if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been, we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years \u2014 such as Saint-Loup\u2019s friends whom I used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the Faisan Dor\u00e9, and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity. In this respect, and because I preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past, a stroll through Donci\u00e8res. might have seemed to me a pr\u00e9figuration of an arrival in Paradise. We dream much of Paradise, or rather of a number of successive Paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a Paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left us at the station. \u201cBut you may have about an hour to wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you spend it here, you will probably see my uncle Charlus, who is going by the train to Paris, ten minutes before yours. I have said good-bye to him already, because I have to go back before his train starts. I didn\u2019t tell him about you, because I hadn\u2019t got your telegram.\u201d To the reproaches which I heaped upon Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us, she replied that she had intended, by her coldness towards me, to destroy any idea that he might have formed if, at the moment when the train stopped, he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist. He had indeed noticed this attitude (I had not caught sight of him, otherwise I should have adopted one that was more correct), and had had time to murmur in my ear: \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, one of those priggish little girls you told me about, who wouldn\u2019t go near Mlle. de Stermaria because they thought her fast?\u201d I had indeed mentioned to Robert, and in all sincerity, when I went down from Paris to visit him at Donci\u00e8res, and when we were talking about our time at Balbec, that there was nothing to be had from Albertine, that she was the embodiment of virtue. And now that I had long since discovered for myself that this was false, I was even more anxious that Robert should believe it to be true. It would have been sufficient for me to tell Robert that I was in love with Albertine. He was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims. \u201cYes, she is still rather childish. But you don\u2019t know anything against her?\u201d I added anxiously. \u201cNothing, except that I saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour attitude destroyed absolutely nothing,\u201d I told Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us. \u201cQuite true,\u201d she said to me, \u201cit was stupid of me, I hurt your feelings, I\u2019m far more unhappy about it than you are. You\u2019ll see, I shall never be like that again; forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, holding out her hand with a sorrowful air. At that moment, from the entrance to the waiting-room in which we were sitting, I saw advance slowly, followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Paris, where I encountered him only in evening dress, immobile, straitlaced in a black coat, maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness, his thirst for admiration, the soar of his conversation, I had never realised how far he had aged. Now, in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter, as he swaggered through the room, balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind, the cruel light of day broke up into paint, upon his lips, rice-powder fixed by cold cream, on the tip of his nose, black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair, all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I stood talking to him, though briefly, because of his train, I kept my eye on Albertine\u2019s carriage to shew her that I was coming. When I turned my head towards M. de Charlus, he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier, a relative of his, who was standing on the other side of the platform, as though he were waiting to take our train, but in the opposite direction, away from Balbec. \u201cHe is in his regimental band,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cAs you are so fortunate as to be still young enough, and I unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him.\u201d I took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me, and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman. But, just as I was preparing to execute my commission, what was my surprise, and, I may say, my pleasure, on recognising Morel, the son of my uncle\u2019s valet, who recalled to me so many memories. They made me forget to convey M. de Charlus\u2019s message. \u201cWhat, you are at Donci\u00e8res?\u201d \u201cYes, and they\u2019ve put me in the band attached to the batteries.\u201d But he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone. He had become an intense \u2018poseur,\u2019 and evidently the sight of myself, reminding him of his father\u2019s profession, was not pleasing to him. Suddenly I saw M. de Charlus descending upon us. My delay had evidently taxed his patience. \u201cI should like to listen to a little music this evening,\u201d he said to Morel without any preliminaries, \u201cI pay five hundred francs for the evening, which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends, if you have any in the band.\u201d Knowing as I did the insolence of M. de Charlus, I was astonished at his not even saying how d\u2019ye do to his young friend. The Baron did not however give me time to think. Holding out his hand in the friendliest manner: \u201cGood-bye, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, as a hint that I might now leave them. I had, as it happened, left my dear Albertine too long alone. \u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d I said to her as I climbed into the carriage, \u201clife by the sea-side and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors, and with fewer actors than situations.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d \u201cBecause M. de Charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends, whom, this instant, on the platform of this station, I have just discovered to be one of my own.\u201d But as I uttered these words, I began to wonder how the Baron could have bridged the social gulf to which I had not given a thought. It occurred to me first of all that it might be through Jupien, whose niece, as the reader may remember, had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist. What did baffle me completely was that, when due to leave for Paris in five minutes, the Baron should have asked for a musical evening. But, visualising Jupien\u2019s niece again in my memory, I was beginning to find that \u2018recognitions\u2019 did indeed play an important part in life, when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and I realised that I had been absurdly innocent. M. de Charlus had never in his life set eyes upon Morel, nor Morel upon M. de Charlus, who, dazzled but also terrified by a warrior, albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre, had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that I already knew. In any case, the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to Morel for the absence of any previous relations, for I saw that they continued to talk, without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram. As I recalled the manner in which M. de Charlus had come up to Morel and myself, I saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives, when they picked up a woman in the street. Only the desired object had changed its sex. After a certain age, and even if different evolutions are occurring in us, the more we become ourselves, the more our characteristic features are accentuated. For Nature, while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry, breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms. Besides, the arrogance with which M. de Charlus had accosted the violinist is relative, and depends upon the point of view one adopts. It would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him, not by the prefect of police who, a few years later, was to keep him under observation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Paris train is signalled, Sir,\u201d said the porter who was carrying his luggage. \u201cBut I am not going by the train, put it in the cloakroom, damn you!\u201d said M. de Charlus, as he gave twenty francs to the porter, astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip. This generosity at once attracted a flower-seller. \u201cBuy these carnations, look, this lovely rose, kind gentlemen, it will bring you luck.\u201d M. de Charlus, out of patience, handed her a couple of francs, in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing, and her flowers as well. \u201cGood God, why can\u2019t she leave us alone,\u201d said M. de Charlus, addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone, as of a man distraught, to Morel, to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite enough to talk about as it is.\u201d Perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot, perhaps M. de Charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience, perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation. The musician, turning with a frank, imperative and decided air to the flower-seller, raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible. M. de Charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative, virile gesture, made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty, too massively brutal, with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young David capable of waging war against Goliath. The Baron\u2019s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years. \u201cThis is a person whom I should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business. How he would simplify my life,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The train for Paris (which M. de Charlus did not take) started. Then we took our seats in our own train, Albertine and I, without my knowing what had become of M. de Charlus and Morel. \u201cWe must never quarrel any more, I beg your pardon again,\u201d Albertine repeated, alluding to the Saint-Loup incident. \u201cWe must always be nice to each other,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cAs for your friend Saint-Loup, if you think that I am the least bit interested in him, you are quite mistaken. All that I like about him is that he seems so very fond of you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very good fellow,\u201d I said, taking care not to supply Robert with those imaginary excellences which I should not have failed to invent, out of friendship for himself, had I been with anybody but Albertine. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent creature, frank, devoted, loyal, a person you can rely on to do anything.\u201d In saying this I confined myself, held in check by my jealousy, to telling the truth about Saint-Loup, but what I said was literally true. It found expression in precisely the same terms that Mme. de Villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him, when I did not yet know him, imagined him to be so different, so proud, and said to myself: \u201cPeople think him good because he is a great gentleman.\u201d Just as when she had said to me: \u201cHe would be so pleased,\u201d I imagined, after seeing him outside the hotel, preparing to drive away, that his aunt\u2019s speech had been a mere social banality, intended to natter me. And I had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely, thinking of the things that interested me, of my reading, and because she knew that that was what Saint-Loup liked, as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maximes, who wished to consult Robert about him: \u201cHe will be so pleased.\u201d It was simply that I had learned to know him. But, when I set eyes on him for the first time, I had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude. By his feathers I had judged him to be a bird of another species. It was Albertine now who, perhaps a little because Saint-Loup, in his kindness to myself, had been so cold to her, said to me what I had already thought: \u201cAh! He is as devoted as all that! I notice that people always find all the virtues in other people, when they belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d Now that Saint-Loup belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a thing of which I had never once thought in the course of all these years in which, stripping himself of his prestige, he had displayed to me his virtues. A change in our perspective in looking at other people, more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations, but how much more striking still in love, where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness, that far less than the coolness Saint-Loup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that Albertine scorned me, imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman, and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance, Elstir\u2019s judgment when he said to me of the little band, with just the same sentiment as Mme. de Villeparisis speaking of Saint-Loup: \u201cThey are good girls.\u201d But this was not the opinion that I would instinctively have formed when I heard Albertine say: \u201cIn any case, whether he\u2019s devoted or not, I sincerely hope I shall never see him again, since he\u2019s made us quarrel. We must never quarrel again. It isn\u2019t nice.\u201d I felt, since she had seemed to desire Saint-Loup, almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women, which I had supposed to be incurable. And, faced by Albertine\u2019s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person, the tireless vagrant of rainy days, and which, close-fitting, malleable and grey, seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress\u2019s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor, I tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longed-for bosom and, drawing Albertine towards me: \u201cBut won\u2019t you, indolent traveller, dream upon my shoulder, resting your brow upon it?\u201d I said, taking her head in my hands, and shewing her the wide meadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, on the famous Wednesday, in that same little train, which I had again taken, at Balbec, to go and dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, I was taking care not to miss Cottard at Graincourt-Saint-Vast, where a second telephone message from Mme. Verdurin had told me that I should find him. He was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la Raspeli\u00e8re to the station. And so, as the little train barely stopped for a moment at Graincourt, the first station after Donci\u00e8res, I was standing in readiness at the open window, so afraid was I of not seeing Cottard or of his not seeing me. Vain fears! I had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type, so that they, being moreover in full evening dress, as they stood waiting upon the platform, let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance, fashion and familiarity, by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep, like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention, the serried ranks of the common herd, watched for the arrival of some fellow-member who had taken the train at an earlier station, and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come. This sign of election, with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group, was not all that distinguished them; when numerous, in full strength, they were massed together, forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers \u2014 what Brichot called the pecus \u2014 upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name Verdurin, no hope of ever dining at la Raspeli\u00e8re. To be sure, these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing \u2014 notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved \u2014 the names of those of the faithful whom I was astonished to see continuing to dine out, when many of them had already been doing so, according to the stories that I had heard, before my birth, at a period at once so distant and so vague that I was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness. The contrast between the continuance not only of their existence, but of the fulness of their powers, and the annihilation of so many friends whom I had already seen, in one place or another, pass away, gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stop-press column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected, for instance that of an untimely death, which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge. This is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike, but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare. We shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented, in the newspapers, by their obituary notices. Then I saw that, with the passage of time, not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves, but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions, attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders, when it never occurred to us that, after a certain number of years, their disciples, become masters, would be famous also, and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt. But if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus, their aspect still singled them out in its eyes. Indeed in the train (when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day, assembled them all together), having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member, the carriage in which they were gathered, ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor Ski, flagged with Cottard\u2019s Temps, stood out in the distance like a special saloon, and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade. The only one who might, because of his semi-blindness, have missed these welcoming signals, was Brichot. But one of the party would always volunteer to keep a look-out for the blind man, and, as soon as his straw hat, his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye, he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment. So that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful, without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being \u2018on the loose,\u2019 or even of his not having come \u2018by the train,\u2019 should not pick up the others in the course of the journey. Sometimes the opposite process occurred: one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group; but even when thus isolated, alone of his kind, he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect. The Future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite, who would say to himself: \u201cThat must be somebody,\u201d would discern, round the soft hat of Cottard or of the sculptor Ski, a vague aureole and would be only half-astonished when at the next station an elegant crowd, if it were their terminal point, greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages, all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of Douville station, or, if it were an intermediate station, invaded the compartment. This was what was done, and with precipitation, for some of them had arrived late, just as the train which was already in the station was about to start, by the troop which Cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling. Brichot, who was among these faithful, had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others. As his sight became steadily weaker, he had been obliged, even in Paris, to reduce more and more his working hours after dark. Besides he was out of sympathy with the modern Sorbonne, where ideas of scientific exactitude, after the German model, were beginning to prevail over humanism. He now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner; and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits. That is to say, to evenings at the Verdurins\u2019, or to those parties that now and again were offered to the Verdurins by one of the faithful, tremulous with emotion. It is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do, in detaching Brichot from the little clan. But Mme. Verdurin, who kept her eyes open, and moreover, having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon, had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution, had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person, being skilled in (as she expressed it) \u2018putting things in order\u2019 and \u2018applying the red hot iron to the wound.\u2019 This she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons, who was simply Brichot\u2019s laundress, and Mme. Verdurin, having the right of entry into the Professor\u2019s fifth floor rooms, crimson with rage, when she deigned to climb his stairs, had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat!\u201d the Mistress had said to Brichot, \u201ca woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you, and you receive a creature like that?\u201d Brichot had never forgotten the service that Mme. Verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire, and became more and more strongly attached to her, whereas, in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it, the Mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower, and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand. But Brichot derived from his intimacy with the Verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the Sorbonne. They were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinner-parties to which they would never be invited, by the mention made of him in the reviews, the exhibition of his portrait in the Salon, by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the Faculty of Arts esteemed, but without any prospect of attracting his attention, not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher\u2019s attire, an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor, when one is paying a call, and is not the right thing for dinners in the country, however smart, where it should be replaced by a soft hat, which goes quite well with a dinner-jacket. For the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage, I could not even speak to Cottard, for he was suffocated, not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly. He felt more than the joy inherent in success, almost the hilarity of an excellent joke. \u201cAh! That was a good one!\u201d he said when he had recovered himself. \u201cA minute later! \u2018Pon my soul, that\u2019s what they call arriving in the nick of time!\u201d he added, with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt, for he was now overflowing with assurance, but to express his satisfaction. At length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan. I was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in Paris is called smoking. I had forgotten that the Verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways, retarded by the Dreyfus case, accelerated by the \u2018new\u2019 music, an evolution which for that matter they denied, and continued to deny until it was complete, like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them, so as not to appear defeated if he fails. In addition to which, Society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them. It went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in Society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact. The Verdurin salon was understood to be a Temple of Music. It was there, people assured you, that Vinteuil had found inspiration, encouragement. Now, even if Vinteuil\u2019s sonata remained wholly unappreciated, and almost unknown, his name, quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers, had an extraordinary effect. Moreover, certain young men of the Faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes, there were three of them who had studied music, and among these Vinteuil\u2019s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue. They would speak of it, on returning to their homes, to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture. And, taking an interest in what interested their sons, at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at Mme. Verdurin in her front box, following the music in the printed score. So far, this social success latent in the Verdurins was revealed by two facts only. In the first place, Mme. Verdurin would say of the Principessa di Caprarola: \u201cAh! She is intelligent, she is a charming woman. What I cannot endure, are the imbeciles, the people who bore me, they drive me mad.\u201d Which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the Principessa di Caprarola, a woman who moved in the highest society, had called upon Mme. Verdurin. She had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to Mme. Swann after the death of her husband, and had asked whether she knew them. \u201cWhat name did you say?\u201d Odette had asked, with a sudden wistfulness. \u201cVerdurin? Oh, yes, of course,\u201d she had continued in a plaintive tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know them, or rather, I know them without really knowing them, they are people I used to meet at people\u2019s houses, years ago, they are quite nice.\u201d When the Principessa di Caprarola had gone, Odette would fain have spoken the bare truth. But the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations, but the revelation of her fears, of her desires. She denied not what it would have been adroit to deny, but what she would have liked not to have happened, even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact. A little later she had recovered her assurance, and would indeed anticipate questions by saying, so as not to appear to be afraid of them: \u201cMme. Verdurin, why, I used to know her terribly well!\u201d with an affectation of humility, like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram. \u201cThere has been a great deal of talk about the Verdurins lately,\u201d said Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. Odette, with the smiling disdain of a Duchess, replied: \u201cYes, I do seem to have heard a lot about them lately. Every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society,\u201d without reflecting that she herself was among the newest. \u201cThe Principessa di Caprarola has dined there,\u201d Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 went on. \u201cAh!\u201d replied Odette, accentuating her smile, \u201cthat does not surprise me. That sort of thing always begins with the Principessa di Caprarola, and then some one else follows suit, like Comtesse Mole.\u201d Odette, in saying this, appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of \u2018house-warming\u2019 in recently established drawing-rooms. One felt from her tone that the implication was that she, Odette, was, like Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the admission that Mme. Verdurin had made of the Principessa di Caprarola\u2019s intelligence, the second indication that the Verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that (without, of course, their having formally requested it) they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress. M. Verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew, the one who was \u2018in the cart.\u2019 Among those who entered my carriage at Graincourt was Saniette, who long ago had been expelled from the Verdurins\u2019 by his cousin Forcheville, but had since returned. His faults, from the social point of view, had originally been \u2014 notwithstanding his superior qualities \u2014 something like Cottard\u2019s, shyness, anxiety to please, fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so. But if the course of life, by making Cottard assume, if not at the Verdurins\u2019, where he had, because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings, remained more or less the same, at least in his practice, in his hospital ward, at the Academy of Medicine, a shell of coldness, disdain, gravity, that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns, had made a clean cut between the old Cottard and the new, the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in Saniette, the more he sought to correct them. Conscious that he was frequently boring, that people did not listen to him, instead of then slackening his pace as Cottard would have done, of forcing their attention by an air of authority, not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation, he increased his pace, cleared the ground, used abbreviations in order to appear less long-winded, more familiar with the matters of which he spoke, and succeeded only, by making them unintelligible, in seeming interminable. His self-assurance was not like that of Cottard, freezing his patients, who, when other people praised his social graces, would reply: \u201cHe is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room, you with your face to the light, and he with his back to it, and those piercing eyes.\u201d It failed to create an effect, one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness, that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it. Saniette, whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in self-confidence, and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself, attain with ease to the success that was denied to him, never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery, fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares. Sometimes, giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say, people would do him the honour of a general silence. But the story would fall flat. A fellow-guest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to Saniette the private, almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation, making it reach him furtively, without attracting attention, as one passes a note from hand to hand. But nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility, to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh. Long after the story was ended and had fallen flat, Saniette, crestfallen, would remain smiling to himself, as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt. As for the sculptor Ski, so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his Polish surname, and because he himself made an affectation, since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere, of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives, perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous, he had, at forty-four and with no pretension to good looks, a sort of boyishness, a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been, until the age of ten, the most charming prodigal imaginable, the darling of all the ladies. Mme. Verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than Elstir. Any resemblance that there may have been between them was, however, purely external. It was enough to make Elstir, who had met Ski once, feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who r\u00e9semble us in what is least good, in whom are displayed our worst qualities, the faults of which we have cured ourselves, who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are. But Mme. Verdurin thought that Ski had more temperament than Elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression, and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy. This seemed to the Mistress to be actually an additional gift, being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius. Ski would paint anything you asked, on cuff-links or on the panels over doors. He sang with the voice of a composer, played from memory, giving the piano the effect of an orchestra, less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses, which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered, which, for that matter, he would imitate with his lips. Choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression, just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say \u2018Ping!\u2019 so as to let the brasses be heard, he was regarded as marvellously intelligent, but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three, extremely limited. Bored with his reputation for whimsicality, he had set himself to shew that he was a practical, matter-of-fact person, whence a triumphant affectation of false precision, of false common sense, aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate. The movements of his head, neck, limbs, would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old, with golden curls, a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather. Having reached Graincourt station with Cottard and Brichot, with time to spare, he and Cottard had left Brichot in the waiting-room and had gone for a stroll. When Cottard proposed to turn back, Ski had replied: \u201cBut there is no hurry. It isn\u2019t the local train to-day, it\u2019s the departmental train.\u201d Delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon Cottard, he added, with reference to himself: \u201cYes, because Ski loves the arts, because he models in clay, people think he\u2019s not practical. Nobody knows this line better than I do.\u201d Nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when, all of a sudden, catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train, Cottard, with a wild shout, had exclaimed: \u201cWe shall have to put our best foot foremost.\u201d They did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare, the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of Ski. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the Princess on the train?\u201d came in ringing tones from Brichot, whose huge spectacles, resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients, seemed to have taken their life from the Professor\u2019s eyes, and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them, seemed themselves, even at the most trivial moments, to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity. Brichot\u2019s malady, as it gradually deprived him of his sight, had revealed to him the beauties of that sense, just as, frequently, we have to have made up our minds to part with some object, to make a present of it for instance, before we can study it, regret it, admire it. \u201cNo, no, the Princess went over to Maineville with some of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s guests who were taking the Paris train. It is within the bounds of possibility that Mme. Verdurin, who had some business at Saint-Mars, may be with her! In that case, she will be coming with us, and we shall all travel together, which will be delightful. We shall have to keep our eyes skinned at Maineville and see what we shall see! Oh, but that\u2019s nothing, you may say that we came very near to missing the bus. When I saw the train I was dumbfoundered. That\u2019s what is called arriving at the psychological moment. Can\u2019t you picture us missing the train, Mme. Verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us: Tableau!\u201d added the doctor, who had not yet recovered from his emotion. \u201cThat would be a pretty good joke, wouldn\u2019t it? Now then, Brichot, what have you to say about our little escapade?\u201d inquired the doctor with a note of pride. \u201cUpon my soul,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cwhy, yes, if you had found the train gone, that would have been what the late Villemain used to call a wipe in the eye!\u201d But I, distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me, was suddenly reminded of what Cottard had said to me in the ball-room of the little casino, and, just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory, the vision of Albertine leaning her breasts against Andr\u00e9e\u2019s caused my heart a terrible pain. This pain did not last: the idea of Albertine\u2019s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion, forty-eight hours earlier, when the advances that my mistress had made to Saint-Loup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old. I was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another. At Harambouville, as the tram was full, a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment. The doctor, feeling that the Princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person, called a porter, shewed his card, describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies, and obliged the station-master to make the farmer get out. This incident so pained and alarmed Saniette\u2019s timid spirit that, as soon as he saw it beginning, fearing already lest, in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform, it should assume the proportions of a rising, he pretended to be suffering from a stomach-ache, and, so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor\u2019s violence, wandered down the corridor, pretending to be looking for what Cottard called the \u2018water.\u2019 Failing to find one, he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the \u2018twister.\u2019 \u201cIf this is your first appearance at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Sir,\u201d I was addressed by Brichot, anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer, \u201cyou will find that there is no place where one feels more the \u2018amenities of life,\u2019 to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism, of pococurantism, of all sorts of words in \u2014 ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses, I refer to M. le Prince de Talleyrand.\u201d For, when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past, he thought it clever and \u2018in the period\u2019 to prefix a \u2018M.\u2019 to their titles, and said \u2018M. le Duc de La Rochefoucauld,\u2019 \u2018M. le Cardinal de Retz,\u2019 referring to these also as \u2018That struggle-for-lifer de Gondi,\u2019 \u2018that Boulangist de Marcillac.\u2019 And he never failed to call Montesquieu, with a smile, when he referred to him: \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident Second\u00e2t de Montesquieu.\u201d An intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lecture-room. But in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a Prince, there is a pedantry also, which betrays a different caste, that in which one prefixes \u2018the Emperor\u2019 to the name \u2018William\u2019 and addresses a Royal Highness in the third person. \u201cAh, now that is a man,\u201d Brichot continued, still referring to \u2018Monsieur le Prince de Talleyrand\u2019\u2014\u201cto whom we take off our hats. He is an ancestor.\u201d \u201cIt is a charming house,\u201d Cottard told me, \u201cyou will find a little of everything, for Mme. Verdurin is not exclusive, great scholars like Brichot, the high nobility, such as the Princess Sherbatoff, a great Russian lady, a friend of the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted.\u201d As a matter of fact the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, not wishing Princess Sherbatoff, who for years past had been cut by everyone, to come to her house when there might be other people, allowed her to come only in the early morning, when Her Imperial Highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the Princess as it would have been awkward for the Princess to meet them. As, for the last three years, as soon as she came away, like a manicurist, from the Grand Duchess, Mme. Sherbatoff would go on to Mme. Verdurin, who had just awoken, and stuck to her for the rest of the day, one might say that the Princess\u2019s loyalty surpassed even that of Brichot, constant as he was at those Wednesdays, both in Paris, where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of Chateaubriand at l\u2019Abbaye-aux-Bois, and in the country, where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of Mme. de Ch\u00e2telet the man whom he always named (with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction): \u201cM. de Voltaire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her want of friends had enabled Princess Sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the Verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 the type of faithfulness, the ideal which Mme. Verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now, in her later years, she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit. However keenly the Mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy, it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have \u2018failed\u2019 her at least once. The most stay-at-home yielded to the temptation to travel; the most continent fell from virtue; the most robust might catch influenza, the idlest be caught for his month\u2019s soldiering, the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother. And it was in vain that Mme. Verdurin told them then, like the Roman Empress, that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey, like the Christ or the Kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her, that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company, by her, their sole remedy and sole delight. But destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made Mme. Verdurin meet the Princess Sherbatoff. Out of touch with her family, an exile from her native land, knowing nobody but the Baroness Putbus and the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, to whose houses, because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former, and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the Princess, she went only in the early morning hours when Mme. Verdurin was still asleep, never once, so far as she could remember, having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old, when she had had the measles, having on the 3lst of December replied to Mme. Verdurin who, afraid of being left alone, had asked her whether she would not \u2018shake down\u2019 there for the night, in spite of its being New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cWhy, what is there to prevent me, any day of the year? Besides, to-morrow is a day when one stays at home, and this is my home,\u201d living in a boarding-house, and moving from it whenever the Verdurins moved, accompanying them upon their holidays, the Princess had so completely exemplified to Mme. Verdurin the line of Vigny:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou only didst appear that which one seeks always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the Lady President of the little circle, anxious to make sure of one of her \u2018faithful\u2019 even after death, had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side. Before strangers \u2014 among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread: ourself \u2014 Princess Sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships \u2014 with the Grand Duchess, the Verdurins, and the Baroness Putbus \u2014 as the only ones, not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest, but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other, and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself. \u201cI see nobody else,\u201d she would say, insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits. She would add: \u201cI visit only three houses,\u201d as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play. Whether or not M. and Mme. Verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction, they had helped the Princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful. And they in turn were persuaded both that the Princess, among the thousands of invitations that were offered her, had chosen the Verdurins alone, and that the Verdurins, courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their eyes, the Princess, too far superior to her native element not to find it boring, among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed, found the Verdurins alone entertaining, while they, in return, deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind, the Princess Sherbatoff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess was very rich; she engaged for every first night a large box, to which, with the assent of Mme. Verdurin, she invited the faithful and nobody else. People would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white, turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits. They admired both her influence and her humility, for, having always with her an Academician, Brichot, a famous scientist, Cottard, the leading pianist of the day, at a later date M. de Charlus, she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre, remained in the background, paid no attention to the rest of the house, lived exclusively for the little group, who, shortly before the end of the performance, would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign, who was not without a certain timid, fascinating, faded beauty. But if Mme. Sherbatoff did not look at the audience, remained in shadow, it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know: the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger. Nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit. They imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew, that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men. The Princess was compelled, if you spoke to her about anyone, or introduced anyone to her, to feign an intense coldness, in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society. Nevertheless, with the support of Cottard or Mme. Verdurin, several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation, and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer. If he was entirely unimportant, the rest would be astonished. \u201cHow strange that the Princess, who refuses to know anyone, should make an exception of such an uninteresting person.\u201d But these fertilising acquaintances were rare, and the Princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard said far more often: \u201cI shall see him on Wednesday at the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d than: \u201cI shall see him on Tuesday at the Academy.\u201d He spoke, too, of the Wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable. But Cottard was one of those people, little sought after, who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders, like a military or judicial summons. It required a call from a very important patient to make him \u201cfail\u201d the Verdurins on a Wednesday, the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint. For Cottard, excellent fellow as he was, would forego the delights of a Wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke, but for a Minister\u2019s cold. Even then he would say to his wife: \u201cMake my apologies to Mme. Verdurin. Tell her that I shall be coming later on. His Excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold.\u201d One Wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm, Cottard, already in his dinner-jacket to go to the Verdurins\u2019, had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut: \u201cOf course I can\u2019t, L\u00e9ontine,\u201d he had groaned; \u201ccan\u2019t you see I\u2019ve got my white waistcoat on?\u201d So as not to annoy her husband, Mme. Cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser. He, to save time, had taken a cab, with the result that, his carriage entering the courtyard just as Cottard\u2019s was emerging to take him to the Verdurins\u2019, five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass. Mme. Cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress. Cottard sat cursing the delay, from remorse perhaps, and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the Wednesday\u2019s pleasures to dispel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If one of Cottard\u2019s patients were to ask him: \u201cDo you ever see the Guermantes?\u201d it was with the utmost sincerity that the Professor would reply: \u201cPerhaps not actually the Guermantes, I can\u2019t be certain. But I meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine. You must, of course, have heard of the Verdurins. They know everybody. Besides, they certainly are not people who\u2019ve come down in the world. They\u2019ve got the goods, all right. It is generally estimated that Mme. Verdurin is worth thirty-five million. Gad, thirty-five million, that\u2019s a pretty figure. And so she doesn\u2019t make two bites at a cherry. You mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes. Let me explain the difference. Mme. Verdurin is a great lady, the Duchesse de Guermantes is probably a nobody. You see the distinction, of course. In any case, whether the Guermantes go to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or not, she entertains all the very best people, the d\u2019Sherbat\u00f4ffs, the d\u2019Forchevilles, e tutti quanti, people of the highest flight, all the nobility of France and Navarre, with whom you would see me conversing as man to man. Of course, those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science,\u201d he added, with a smile of fatuous conceit, brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like Potain and Charcot should now be applicable to himself, as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom, and, after a long course of study, had learned them by heart. And so, after mentioning to me Princess Sherbatoff as one of the people who went to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Cottard added with a wink: \u201cThat gives you an idea of the style of the house, if you see what I mean?\u201d He meant that it was the very height of fashion. Now, to entertain a Russian lady who knew nobody but the Grand Duchess Eudoxie was not fashionable at all. But Princess Sherbatoff might not have known even her, it would in no way have diminished Cottard\u2019s estimate of the supreme elegance of the Verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there. The splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage, in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels, when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper. A man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth, who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances, because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes. The same man, on the other hand, need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people, for innumerable Cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawing-rooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance, ladies who were not even what Mme. de Villeparisis and her friends were (great ladies fallen from their greatness, whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited); no, those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men, if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties, Mme. de Cambremer would be no more able than Mme. de Guermantes to identify them. But what of that! A Cottard has thus his Marquise, who is to him \u201cthe Baronne,\u201d as in Marivaux, the Baronne whose name is never mentioned, so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name. Cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy \u2014 which has never heard of the lady \u2014 in that, the more dubious titles are, the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses, silver, notepaper, luggage. Many Cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among Princes, just as with the small shopkeeper who, on Sundays, goes sometimes to look at \u201cold time\u201d buildings, it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time, the vaults of which have been, by the pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars, that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages. \u201cThe Princess will be at Maineville. She will be coming with us. But I shall not introduce you to her at once. It will be better to leave that to Mme. Verdurin. Unless I find a loophole. Then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns.\u201d \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d asked Saniette, as he rejoined us, pretending to have gone out to take the air. \u201cI was quoting to this gentleman,\u201d said Brichot, \u201ca saying, which you will remember, of the man who, to my mind, is the first of the fins-de-si\u00e8cle (of the eighteenth century, that is), by name Charles Maurice, Abb\u00e9 de Perigord. He began by promising to be an excellent journalist. But he made a bad end, by which I mean that he became a Minister! Life has these tragedies. A far from serapulous politician to boot who, with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman, did not hesitate to work in his time for the King of Prussia, there are no two ways about it, and died in the skin of a \u2018Left Centre.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs we were joined by a glorious girl who, unfortunately, was not one of the little group. I could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin, her dark eyes, her bold and admirable outlines. A moment later she wanted to open a window, for it was hot in the compartment, and not wishing to ask leave of everybody, as I alone was without a greatcoat, she said to me in a quick, cool, jocular voice: \u201cDo you mind a little fresh air, Sir?\u201d I would have liked to say to her: \u201cCome with us to the Verdurins\u2019?\u201d or \u201cGive me your name and address.\u201d I answered: \u201cNo, fresh air doesn\u2019t bother me, Mademoiselle.\u201d Whereupon, without stirring from her seat: \u201cDo your friends object to smoke?\u201d and she lit a cigarette. At the third station she sprang from the carriage. Next day, I inquired of Albertine, who could she be. For, stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love, in my jealousy of Albertine\u2019s attitude towards Robert, I was reassured so far as other women were concerned. Albertine told me, I believe quite sincerely, that she did not know. \u201cI should so much like to see her again,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, one always sees people again,\u201d replied Albertine. In this particular instance, she was wrong; I never saw again, nor did I ever identify, the pretty girl with the cigarette. We shall see, moreover, why, for a long time, I ceased to look for her. But I have not forgotten her. I find myself at times, when I think of her, seized by a wild longing. But these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded. We can sometimes find a person again, but we cannot abolish time. And so on until the unforeseen day, gloomy as a winter night, when we no longer seek for that girl, or for any other, when to find her would actually frighten us. For we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her, or strength to love her. Not, of course, that we are, in the strict sense of the word, impotent. And as for loving, we should love her more than ever. But we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left. Eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them. To set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap. To be seen in such a state by a girl we love, even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth! We can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth. All the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing! We procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract, who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill no news, I suppose, of the violinist,\u201d said Cottard. The event of the day in the little clan was, in fact, the failure of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite violinist. Employed on military service near Donci\u00e8res, he came three times a week to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, having a midnight pass. But two days ago, for the first time, the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram. It was supposed that he had missed it. But albeit Mme. Verdurin had sent to meet the next tram, and so on until the last had arrived, the carriage had returned empty. \u201cHe\u2019s certain to have been shoved into the guard-room, there\u2019s no other explanation of his desertion. Gad! In soldiering, you know, with those fellows, it only needs a bad-tempered serjeant.\u201d \u201cIt will be all the more mortifying for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cif he fails again this evening, because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d \u201cThis evening, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer!\u201d exclaimed Cottard. \u201cBut I knew absolutely nothing about it. Naturally, I knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day, but I had no idea that it was to be so soon. Sapristi!\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201cwhat did I tell you? The Princess Sherbatoff, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d And, after repeating these names, lulling himself with their melody: \u201cYou see that we move in good company,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s your first appearance, you\u2019ll be one of the crowd. It is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering.\u201d And, turning to Brichot, he went on: \u201cThe Mistress will be furious. It is time we appeared to lend her a hand.\u201d Ever since Mme. Verdurin had been at la Raspeli\u00e8re she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening. By so doing she would obtain better terms next year, she explained, and was inviting them for business reasons only. But she pretended to regard with such terror, to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day. The prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed, albeit exaggerating them, if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself. She was therefore partly sincere, she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world, one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce, that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials, people ignorant of the Ring and the Meistersinger, who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable, by coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, of ruining one of those famous Wednesdays, masterpieces of art incomparable and frail, like those Venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter. \u201cBesides, they are bound to be absolutely anti, and militarists,\u201d M. Verdurin had said. \u201cOh, as for that, I don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ve heard quite enough about all that business,\u201d had replied Mme. Verdurin, who, a sincere Dreyfusard, would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant Dreyfusism of her salon. For Dreyfusism was triumphant politically, but not socially. Labori, Reinach, Picquart, Zola were still, to people in society, more or less traitors, who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus. And so, after this incursion into politics, Mme. Verdurin was determined to return to the world of art. Besides were not Indy, Debussy, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side in the Case? \u201cSo far as the Case goes, we need only remember Brichot,\u201d she said (the Don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the General Staff, which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of Madame Verdurin). \u201cThere is no need to be eternally discussing the Dreyfus case. No, the fact of the matter is that the Cambremers bore me.\u201d As for the faithful, no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the Cambremers\u2019 acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which Mme. Verdurin said she felt to invite them, they returned, day after day, in conversation with her, to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation, tried to make them irresistible. \u201cMake up your mind to it once and for all,\u201d Cottard repeated, \u201cand you will have better terms for next year, they will pay the gardener, you will have the use of the meadow. That will be well worth a boring evening. I am thinking only of yourselves,\u201d he added, albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion, when, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s carriage, he had met the carriage of the old Mme. de Cambremer and, what was more, he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when, at the station, he had found himself standing beside the Marquis. For their part, the Cambremers, living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of Mme. Verdurin, imagined that she was a person who could know none but Bohemians, was perhaps not even legally married, and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves. They had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who, they hoped, would return again for many seasons, especially after they had, in the previous month, learned that she had recently inherited all those millions. It was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day. The faithful had given up hope of its ever coming, so often had Mme. Verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed. These false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinner-party, but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail. Not that the Mistress guessed that the \u201cgreat day\u201d was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself, but in order that, having persuaded them that this dinner-party was to her the most terrible of social duties, she might make an appeal to their devotion. \u201cYou are not going to leave me all alone with those Chinese mandarins! We must assemble in full force to support the boredom. Naturally, we shan\u2019t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested. It will be a Wednesday spoiled, but what is one to do!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d Brichot explained to me, \u201cI fancy that Mme. Verdurin, who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her Wednesdays, was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains. She could not bring herself to invite the dowager Marquise, but has resigned herself to having the son and daughter-in-law.\u201d \u201cAh! We are to see the Marquise de Cambremer?\u201d said Cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality, albeit he had no idea whether Mme. de Cambremer were good-looking or not. But the title Marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry. \u201cAh! I know her,\u201d said Ski, who had met her once when he was out with Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNot in the biblical sense of the word, I trust,\u201d said the doctor, darting a sly glance through his eyeglass; this was one of his favourite pleasantries. \u201cShe is intelligent,\u201d Ski informed me. \u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, seeing that I said nothing, and dwelling with a smile upon each word, \u201cshe is intelligent and at the same time she is not, she lacks education, she is frivolous, but she has an instinct for beautiful things. She may say nothing, but she will never say anything silly. And besides, her colouring is charming. She would be an amusing person to paint,\u201d he added, half shutting his eyes, as though he saw her posing in front of him. As my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what Ski was expressing with so many fine shades, I observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer, M. Legrandin. \u201cThere, you see, you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman,\u201d Brichot said to me, \u201cand one never knows what may come of that. Cleopatra was not even a great lady, she was a little woman, the unconscious, terrible little woman of our Meilhac, and just think of the consequences, not only to that idiot Antony, but to the whole of the ancient world.\u201d \u201cI have already been introduced to Mme. de Cambremer,\u201d I replied. \u201cAh! In that case, you will find yourself on familiar ground.\u201d \u201cI shall be all the more delighted to meet her,\u201d I answered him, \u201cbecause she has promised me a book by the former cur\u00e9 of Com-bray about the place-names of this district, and I shall be able to remind her of her promise. I am interested in that priest, and also in etymologies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t put any faith in the ones he gives,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthere is a copy of the book at la Raspeli\u00e8re, which I have glanced through, but without finding anything of any value; it is a mass of error. Let me give you an example. The word Bricq is found in a number of place-names in this neighbourhood. The worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from Briga, a height, a fortified place. He finds it already in the Celtic tribes, Latobriges, Nemetobriges, and so forth, and traces it down to such names as Briand, Brion, and so forth. To confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment, Bricquebose means the wood on the height, Bricqueville the habitation on the height, Bricquebec, where we shall be stopping presently before coming to Maineville, the height by the stream. Now there is not a word of truth in all this, for the simple reason that bricq is the old Norse word which means simply a bridge. Just as fleur, which Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 takes infinite pains to connect, in one place with the Scandinavian words floi, flo, in another with the Irish word ae or aer, is, beyond any doubt, the fjord of the Danes, and means harbour. So too, the excellent priest thinks that the station of Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, which adjoins la Raspeli\u00e8re, means Saint-Martin-le-Vieux (vetus). It is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region. Vieux comes as a rule from vadum, and means a passage, as at the place called les Vieux. It is what the English call ford (Oxford, Hereford). But, in this particular instance, V\u00eatu is derived not from vetus, but from vas-tatus, a place that is devastated and bare. You have, round about here, Sottevast, the vast of Setold, Brillevast, the vast of Berold. I am all the more certain of the cure\u2019s mistake, in that Saint-Mars-le-Vetu was formerly called Saint-Mars du Cast and even Saint-Mars-de-Terregate. Now the v and the g in these words are the same letter. We say d\u00e9vaster, but also g\u00e2cher. J\u00e2ch\u00e8res andgatines (from the High German wastinna) have the same meaning: Terregate is therefore terra vasta. As for Saint-Mars, formerly (save the mark) Saint-Merd, it is Saint-Medardus, which appears variously as Saint-M\u00e9dard, Saint-Mard, Saint-Marc, Cinq-Mars, and even Dammas. Nor must we forget that quite close to here, places bearing the name of Mars are proof simply of a pagan origin (the god Mars) which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see. The high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent, such as the mount of Jupiter (Jeumont). Your cur\u00e9 declines to admit this, but, on the other hand, wherever Christianity has left traces, they escape his notice. He has gone so far afield as to Loctudy, a barbarian name, according to him, whereas it is simply Locus Sancti Tudeni, nor has he in Sammarcoles divined Sanctus Martialis. Your cur\u00e9,\u201d Brichot continued, seeing that I was interested, \u201cderives the terminations hon, home, holm, from the word holl (hullus), a hill, whereas it cornes from the Norse holm, an island, with which you are familiar in Stockholm, and which is so widespread throughout this district, la Houlme, Engohomme, Tahoume, Robehomme, N\u00e9homme, Quettehon, and so forth.\u201d These names made me think of the day when Albertine had wished to go to Amfreville-la-Bigot (from the name of two successive lords of the manor, Brichot told me), and had then suggested that we should dine together at Robehomme. As for Maineville, we were just coming to it. \u201cIsn\u2019t N\u00e9homme,\u201d I asked, \u201csomewhere near Carquethuit and Clitourps?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; N\u00e9homme is the holm, the island or peninsula of the famous Viscount Nigel, whose name has survived also in Neville. The Carquethuit and Clitourps that you mention furnish Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an occasion for further blunders. No doubt he has seen that carque is a church, the Kirche of the Germans. You will remember Querqueville, not to mention Dun-kerque. For there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word Dun, which to the Celts meant high ground. And that you will find over the whole of France. Your abb\u00e9 was hypnotised by Duneville, which recurs in the Eure-et-Loir; he would have found Ch\u00e2teaudun, Dun-le-Roi in the Cher, Duneau in the Sarthe, Dun in the Ari\u00e8ge, Dune-les-Places in the Ni\u00e8vre, and many others. This word Dun leads him into a curious error with regard to Douville where we shall be alighting, and shall find Mme. Verdurin\u2019s comfortable carriages awaiting us. Douville, in Latin donvilla, says he. As a matter of fact, Douville does lie at the foot of high hills. Your cur\u00e9, who knows everything, feels all the same that he has made a blunder. He has, indeed, found in an old cartulary, the name Domvilla. Whereupon he retracts; Douville, according to him, is a fief belonging to the Abbot, Domino Abbati, of Mont Saint-Michel. He is delighted with the discovery, which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that, according to the Capitulary of Sainte-Claire sur Epte, was led at Mont Saint-Michel, though no more extraordinary than to picture the King of Denmark as suzerain of all this coast, where he encouraged the worship of Odin far more than that of Christ. On the other hand, the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me, and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct Lyon, which also is derived from Dun (Lugdunum). But the fact is, the abb\u00e9 is mistaken. Douville was never Donville, but Doville, Eudonis villa, the village of Eudes. Douville was formerly called Escalecliff, the steps up the cliff. About the year 1233, Eudes le Bouteiller, Lord of Escalecliff, set out for the Holy Land; on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the Abbey of Blanche-lande. By an exchange of courtesies, the village took his name, whence we have Douville to-day. But I must add that toponymy, of which moreover I know little or nothing, is not an exact science; had we not this historical evidence, Douville might quite well come from Ouville, that is to say the Waters. The forms in ai (Aigu\u00ebs-Mortes), from aqua, are constantly changed to eu or ou. Now there were, quite close to Douville, certain famous springs, Carquethuit. You might suppose that the cur\u00e9 was only too ready to detect there a Christian origin, especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert, since successive attempts were made by Saint Ursal, Saint Gofroi, Saint Barsanore, Saint Laurent of Br\u00e8vedent, who finally handed over the task to the monks of Beaubec. But as regards thuit the writer is mistaken, he sees in it a form of toft, a building, as in Cricquetot, Ectot, Yvetot, whereas it is the thveit, the clearing, the reclaimed land, as in Braquetuit, le Thuit, Regnetuit, and so forth. Similarly, if he recognises in Clitourps the Norman thorp which means village, he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus, a slope, whereas it comes from cliff, a precipice. But his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices. However loyal a Frenchman one is, there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take Saint-Laurent en Bray to be the Roman priest, so famous at one time, when he is actually Saint Lawrence \u2018Toot, Archbishop of Dublin. But even more than his patriotic sentiments, your friend\u2019s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors. Thus you have not far from our hosts at la Raspeli\u00e8re two places called Montmartin, Montmartin-sur-Mer and Mont-martin-en-Graignes. In the case of Craignes, the good cur\u00e9 has been quite right, he has seen that Craignes, in Latin Crania, in GreekKrene, means ponds, marshes; how many instances of Cresmays, Croen, Gremeville, Lengronne, might we not adduce? But, when he comes to Montmartin, your self-styled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to Saint Martin. He bases his opinion upon the fact that the Saint is their patron, but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently; or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism; he refuses to see that we should say Mont-Saint-Martin as we say Mont-Saint-Michel, if it were a question of Saint Martin, whereas the name Montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god Mars, temples of which, it is true, no other vestige remains, but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast Roman camps would render highly probable even without the name Montmartin, which removes all doubt. You see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la Raspeli\u00e8re is far from perfect.\u201d I protested that at Combray the cur\u00e9 had often told us interesting etymologies. \u201cHe was probably better on his own ground, the move to Normandy must have made him lose his bearings.\u201d \u201cNor did it do him any good,\u201d I added, \u201cfor he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism.\u201d \u201cAh, his neurasthenia is to blame. He has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology, as my worthy master Pocquelin would have said. Tell us, Cottard, do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology, philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly, rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuro-arthritism. You may pass from one to the other by metastasis.\u201d \u201cThe eminent Professor,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cexpresses himself in a French as highly infused with Latin and Greek as M. Purgon himself, of Moli\u00e8resque memory! My uncle, I refer to our national Sarcey. . . . \u201d But he was prevented from finishing his sentence. The Professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout: \u201cThe devil!\u201d he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech, \u201cwe have passed Maineville (d\u2019you hear?) and Renneville too.\u201d He had just noticed that the train was stopping at Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, where most of the passengers alighted. \u201cThey can\u2019t have run through without stopping. We must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the Cambremers. Listen to me, Ski, pay attention, I am going to tell you \u2018a good one,\u2019\u201d said Cottard, who had taken a fancy to this expression, in common use in certain medical circles. \u201cThe Princess must be on the train, she can\u2019t have seen us, and will have got into another compartment. Come along and find her. Let\u2019s hope this won\u2019t land us in trouble!\u201d And he led us all off in search of Princess Sherbatoff. He found her in the corner of an empty compartment, reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. She had long ago, from fear of rebuffs, acquired the habit of keeping in her place, or remaining in her corner, in life as on the train, and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her. She went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage. I recognised her immediately; this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth, who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the Verdurins\u2019, was the lady whom, on the same train, I had put down, two days earlier, as possibly the keeper of a brothel. Her social personality, which had been so vague, became clear to me as soon as I learned her name, just as when, after racking our brains over a puzzle, we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity, and which, in the case of a person, is his name. To discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number. Big restaurants, casinos, local trains, are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas. \u201cPrincess, we must have missed you at Maineville! May we come and sit in your compartment?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Princess who, upon hearing Cottard address her, but only then, raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which, like the eyes of M. de Charlus, although gentler, saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware. Cottard, coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the Cambremers was a sufficient recommendation, decided, after a momentary hesitation, to intro-duce me to the Princess, who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time. \u201cCr\u00e9 nom!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cmy wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waist-coat. Ah! Those women, they never remember anything. Don\u2019t you ever marry, my boy,\u201d he said to me. And as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say, he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the Princess and the rest of the faithful, who, because he was a Professor and an Academician, smiled back, admiring his good temper and freedom from pride. The Princess informed us that the young violinist had been found. He had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache, but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at Donci\u00e8res. She had learned this from Mme. Verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning, she told us in a rapid voice, rolling her r_s, with her Russian accent, softly at the back of her throat, as though they were not r_s but l_s. \u201cAh! You had luncheon with her this morning,\u201d Cottard said to the Princess; but turned his eyes to myself, the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the Princess was with the Mistress. \u201cYou are indeed a faithful adherent!\u201d \u201cYes, I love the little cirlcle, so intelligent, so agleeable, neverl spiteful, quite simple, not at all snobbish, and clevel to theirl fingle-tips.\u201d \u201cNom d\u2019une pipe! I must have lost my ticket, I can\u2019t find it anywhere,\u201d cried Cottard, with an agitation that was, in the circumstances, quite unjustified. He knew that at Douville, where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us, the collector would let him pass without a ticket, and would only bare his head all the more humbly, so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence, to wit that he had of course recognised Cottard as one of the Verdurins\u2019 regular guests. \u201cThey won\u2019t shove me in the lock-up for that,\u201d the doctor concluded. \u201cYou were saying, Sir,\u201d I inquired of Brichot, \u201cthat there used to be some famous waters near here; how do we know that?\u201d \u201cThe name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs. It is called Fervaches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t undlestand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d mumbled the Princess, as though she were saying to me out of politeness: \u201cHe\u2019s rather a bore, ain\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWhy, Princess, Fervaches means hot springs. Fervidae aquae. But to return to the young violinist,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cI was quite forgetting, Cottard, to tell you the great news. Had you heard that our poor friend Dechambre, who used to be Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite pianist, has just died? It is terribly sad.\u201d \u201cHe was quite young,\u201d replied Cottard, \u201cbut he must have had some trouble with his liver, there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter, he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past.\u201d \u201cBut he was not so young as all that,\u201d said Brichot; \u201cin the days when Elstir and Swann used to come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Dechambre had already made himself a reputation in Paris, and, what is remarkable, without having first received the baptism of success abroad. Ah! He was no follower of the Gospel according to Saint Barnum, that fellow.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, he could not have been going to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, at that time, he was still in the nursery.\u201d \u201cBut, unless my old memory plays me false, I was under the impression that Dechambre used to play Vinteuil\u2019s sonata for Swann, when that clubman, who had broken with the aristocracy, had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised Prince Consort of our national Odette.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata was played at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s long after Swann ceased to come there,\u201d said the doctor, who, like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them, forget many others, a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do. \u201cYou are hopelessly muddled, though your brain is as sound as ever,\u201d said the doctor with a smile. Brichot admitted that he was mistaken. The train stopped. We were at la Sogne. The name stirred my curiosity. \u201cHow I should like to know what all these names mean,\u201d I said to Cottard. \u201cYou must ask M. Brichot, he may know, perhaps.\u201d \u201cWhy, la Sogne is la Cicogne, Siconia,\u201d replied Brichot, whom I was burning to interrogate about many other names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting her attachment to her \u2018corner,\u2019 Mme. Sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me, so that I might talk more easily with Brichot, whom I wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me, and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine, standing, or seated, or anyhow. She remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer\u2019s intentions, but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly, she would do everything in her power to oblige. At length the train stopped at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, which being more or less equidistant from the villages of F\u00e9terne and Douville, bore for this reason their hyphenated name. \u201cSaperlipopette!\u201d exclaimed Doctor Cottard, when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected, and, pretending to have only just discovered his loss, \u201cI can\u2019t find my ticket, I must have lost it.\u201d But the collector, taking off his cap, assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully. The Princess (giving instructions to the coachman, as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to Mme. Verdurin, who, because of the Cambremers, had not been able to come to the station, as, for that matter, she rarely did) took me, and also Brichot, with herself in one of the carriages. The doctor, Saniette and Ski got into the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver, although quite young, was the Verdurins\u2019 first coachman, the only one who had any right to the title; he took them, in the daytime, on all their excursions, for he knew all the roads, and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on. He was accompanied by extra helpers (whom he selected if necessary). He was an excellent fellow, sober and capable, but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion, not to say nourish dark thoughts. But at the moment he was quite happy, for he had managed to secure a place for his brother, another excellent type of fellow, with the Verdurins. We began by driving through Douville. Grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea, in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness, a softness, a vivacity of extreme tones. The islands and indentations of Rivebelle, far nearer now than at Balbec, gave this part of the coast the appearance, novel to me, of a relief map. We passed by some little bungalows, almost all of which were let to painters; turned into a track upon which some loose cattle, as frightened as were our horses, barred our way for ten minutes, and emerged upon the cliff road. \u201cBut, by the immortal gods,\u201d Brichot suddenly asked, \u201clet us return to that poor Dechambre; do you suppose Mme. Verdurin knows? Has anyone toldher?\u201d Mme. Verdurin, like most people who move in society, simply because she needed the society of other people, never thought of them again for a single day, as soon as, being dead, they could no longer come to the Wednesdays, nor to the Saturdays, nor dine without dressing. And one could not say of the little clan, a type in this respect of all salons, that it was composed of more dead than living members, seeing that, as soon as one was dead, it was as though one had never existed. But, to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased, in other words to postpone one of the dinners \u2014 a thing impossible to the mistress \u2014 as a token of mourning, M. Verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that, in the interest of her health, it must never be mentioned to her. Moreover, and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive, so vulgar an accident, the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it. As for Brichot, since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what M. Verdurin said about his wife, he dreaded for his friend\u2019s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her. \u201cYes, she knew the worst this morning,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cit was impossible to keep it from her.\u201d \u201cAh! Thousand thunders of Zeus!\u201d cried Brichot. \u201cAh! it must have been a terrible blow, a friend of twenty-five years\u2019 standing. There was a man who was one of us.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course, what can you expect? Such incidents are bound to be painful; but Madame Verdurin is a brave woman, she is even more cerebral than emotive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t altogether agree with the Doctor,\u201d said the Princess, whose rapid speech, her murmured accents, certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious. \u201cMme. Verdurin, beneath a cold exterior, conceals treasures of sensibility. M. Verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to Paris for the funeral; he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country.\u201d \u201cThe devil! She wanted to go to Paris, did she? Of course, I know that she has a heart, too much heart perhaps. Poor Dechambre! As Madame Verdurin remarked not two months ago: \u2018Compared with him, Plant\u00e9, Paderewski, Risler himself are nowhere!\u2019 Ah, he could say with better reason than that limelighter Nero, who has managed to take in even German scholarship:Qualis artifex pereo! But he at least, Dechambre, must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood, in the odour of Beethovenian devotion; and gallantly, I have no doubt; he had every right, that interpreter of German music, to pass away while celebrating the Mass in D. But he was, when all is said, the man to greet the unseen with a cheer, for that inspired performer would produce at times from the Parisianised Champagne stock of which he came, the swagger and smartness of a guardsman.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the height we had now reached, the sea suggested no longer, as at Balbec, the undulations of swelling mountains, but on the contrary the view, beheld from a mountain-top or from a road winding round its flank, of a blue-green glacier or a glittering plain, situated at a lower level. The lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface, and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles; the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour, assumed towards the head of the bay, where an estuary opened, the blue whiteness of milk, in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies. I felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect. But at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the Douville toll-house, the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay, withdrew, and all of a sudden I descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which I had already had before me, but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty. The air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me. I adored the Verdurins; that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness. I should have liked to kiss the Princess. I told her that I had never seen anything so beautiful. She professed that she too loved this spot more than any other. But I could see that to her as to the Verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists, but to partake of good meals there, to entertain people whom they liked, to write letters, to read books, in short to live in these surroundings, passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the toll-house, where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that, as from a mountain-top, the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy, I opened the window; the sound, distinctly caught, of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision. Was it not like an index of measurement which, upsetting all our ordinary impressions, shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal, in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them; and that, though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way, they are not great; that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves, the medium through which it has to pass being purer. And in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the toll-house, one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves, which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate, minute and soft precision. I said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art, in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur. I was now at the highest pitch of exaltation, which raised everything round about me accordingly. It melted my heart that the Verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station. I said as much to the Princess, who seemed to think that I was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy. I know that she admitted subsequently to Cottard that she found me very enthusiastic; he replied that I was too emotional, required sedatives and ought to take to knitting. I pointed out to the Princess every tree, every little house smothered in its mantle of roses, I made her admire everything, I would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart. She told me that she could see that I had a gift for painting, that of course I must sketch, that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it. And she confessed that the country was indeed pic-I turesque. We drove through, where it perched upon its height, the little I village of Englesqueville (Engleberti villa, Brichot informed us). \u201cBut are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening, in spite of Dechambre\u2019s death, Princess?\u201d he went on, without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cM. Verldulin insisted that it should not be put off, simply to keep his wife from thinking. And besides, after never failing for all these years to entertain on Wednesdays, such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her. Her nerves are velly bad just now. M. Verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening, because he knew that it would be a great distraction for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said the Princess, forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before. \u201cI think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Princess added. \u201cAh! I am glad you warned me,\u201d Brichot artlessly replied. \u201cI shall pass on your suggestion to Cottard.\u201d The carriage stopped for a moment. It moved on again, but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased. We had turned into the main avenue of la Raspeli\u00e8re where M. Verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps. \u201cI did well to put on a dinner-jacket,\u201d he said, observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs, \u201csince I have such smart gentlemen in my party.\u201d And as I apologised for not having changed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite all right. We\u2019re all friends here. I should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinner-jackets, but it wouldn\u2019t fit you.\u201d The handclasp throbbing with emotion which, as he entered the hall of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist, Brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter. I told him how greatly I admired the scenery. \u201cAh! All the better, and you\u2019ve seen nothing, we must take you round. Why not come and spend a week or two here, the air is excellent.\u201d Brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood. \u201cAh! Poor Dechambre!\u201d he said, but in an undertone, in case Mme. Verdurin was within earshot. \u201cIt is terrible,\u201d replied M. Verdurin lightly. \u201cSo young,\u201d Brichot pursued the point. Annoyed at being detained over these futilities, M. Verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan, not of grief but of irritated impatience: \u201cWhy yes, of course, but what\u2019s to be done about it, it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, talking about him won\u2019t bring him back to life, will it?\u201d And, his civility returning with his joviality: \u201cCome along, my good Brichot, get your things off quickly. We have a bouillabaisse which mustn\u2019t be kept waiting. But, in heaven\u2019s name, don\u2019t start talking about Dechambre to Madame Verdurin. You know that she always hides her feelings, but she is quite morbidly sensitive. I give you my word, when she heard that Dechambre was dead, she almost cried,\u201d said M. Verdurin in a tone of profound irony. One might have concluded, from hearing him speak, that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years\u2019 standing, and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of M. Verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him. \u201cIf you mention it to her, she will go and make herself ill again. It is deplorable, three weeks after her bronchitis. When that happens, it is I who have to be sick-nurse. You can understand that I have had more than enough of it. Grieve for Dechambre\u2019s fate in your heart as much as you like. Think of him, but do not speak about him. I was very fond of Dechambre, but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife. Here\u2019s Cottard, now, you can ask him.\u201d And indeed, he knew that a family doctor can do many little services, such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docile Cottard had said to the Mistress: \u201cUpset yourself like that, and to-morrow you will give me a temperature of 102,\u201d as he might have said to the cook: \u201cTo-morrow you will give me a riz de veau.\u201d Medicine, when it fails to cure the sick, busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin was glad to find that Saniette, notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier, had not deserted the little nucleus. And indeed Mme. Verdurin and her husband had acquired, in their idleness, cruel instincts for which the great occasions, occurring too rarely, no longer sufficed. They had succeeded in effecting a breach between Odette and Swann, between Brichot and his mistress. They would try it again with some one else, that was understood. But the opportunity did not present itself every day. Whereas, thanks to his shuddering sensibility, his timorous and quickly aroused shyness, Saniette provided them with a whipping-block for every day in the year. And so, for fear of his failing them, they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words, such as the bigger boys at school, the old soldiers in a regiment, address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches, with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Brichot reminded Cottard, who had not heard what M. Verdurin was saying, \u201cmum\u2019s the word before Mme. Verdurin. Have no fear, O Cottard, you are dealing with a sage, as Theocritus says. Besides, M. Verdurin is right, what is the use of lamentations,\u201d he went on, for, being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him, but having no finer perception, he had admired in M. Verdurin\u2019s remarks the most courageous stoicism. \u201cAll the same, it is a great talent that has gone from the world.\u201d \u201cWhat, are you still talking about Dechambre,\u201d said M. Verdurin, who had gone on ahead of us, and, seeing that we were not following him, had turned back. \u201cListen,\u201d he said to Brichot, \u201cnothing is gained by exaggeration. The fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius, which he was not. He played well, I admit, and what is more, he was in his proper element here; transplanted, he ceased to exist. My wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation. You know what she is. I will go farther, in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment, he is done to a turn, as the demoiselles de Caen, grilled according to the incomparable recipe of Pampilles, are going to be, I hope (unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this Kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven). You don\u2019t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because Dechambre is dead, when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert; to recover for the moment, and for the moment only, the suppleness of his wrists. Besides, you are going to hear this evening, or at any rate to meet, for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art, after dinner, for the card-table, somebody who is a far greater artist than Dechambre, a youngster whom my wife has discovered\u201d (as she had discovered Dechambre, and Paderewski, and everybody else): \u201cMorel. He has not arrived yet, the devil. He is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up, and who bores him to tears, but otherwise, not to get into trouble with his father, he would have been obliged to stay down at Donci\u00e8res and keep him company: the Baron de Charlus.\u201d The faithful entered the drawing-room. M. Verdurin, who had remained behind with me while I took off my things, took my arm by way of a joke, as one\u2019s host does at a dinner-party when there is no lady for one to take in. \u201cDid you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cYes, M. Brichot told me things which interested me greatly,\u201d said I, thinking of the etymologies, and because I had heard that the Verdurins greatly admired Brichot. \u201cI am surprised to hear that he told you anything,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201che is such a retiring man, and talks so little about the things he knows.\u201d This compliment did not strike me as being very apt. \u201cHe seems charming,\u201d I remarked. \u201cExquisite, delicious, not the sort of man you meet every day, such a light, fantastic touch, my wife adores him, and so do I!\u201d replied M. Verdurin in an exaggerated tone, as though repeating a lesson. Only then did I grasp that what he had said to me about Brichot was ironical. And I asked myself whether M. Verdurin, since those far-off days of which I had heard reports, had not shaken off the yoke of his wife\u2019s tutelage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the Verdurins were willing to have M. de Charlus in their house. Whereas in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where M. de Charlus was so well known, nobody ever referred to his morals (of which most people had no suspicion, others remained doubtful, crediting him rather with intense but Platonic friendships, with behaving imprudently, while the enlightened few strenuously denied, shrugging their shoulders, any insinuation upon which some malicious Gallardon might venture), those morals, the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends, were, on the other hand, being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved, just as, at times, the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence. Moreover, in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion, his great position in society, his noble origin were completely unknown, by a process analogous to that which, among the people of Rumania, has brought it about that the name of Ron-sard is known as that of a great nobleman, while his poetical work is unknown there. Not only that, the Rumanian estimate of Ronsard\u2019s nobility is founded upon an error. Similarly, if in the world of painters and actors M. de Charlus had such an evil reputation, that was due to their confusing him with a certain Comte Leblois de Charlus who was not even related to him (or, if so, the connexion was extremely remote), and who had been arrested, possibly by mistake, in the course of a police raid which had become historic. In short, all the stories related of our M. de Charlus referred to the other. Many professionals swore that they had had relations with M. de Charlus, and did so in good faith, believing that the false M. de Charlus was the true one, the false one possibly encouraging, partly from an affectation of nobility, partly to conceal his vice, a confusion which to the true one (the Baron whom we already know) was for a long time damaging, and afterwards, when he had begun to go down the hill, became a convenience, for it enabled him likewise to say: \u201cThat is not myself.\u201d And in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred. Finally, what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact (the Baron\u2019s tendencies), he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who, in the theatrical world, had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved. When they were seen together at a first night, people would say: \u201cYou see,\u201d just as it was supposed that the Duchesse de Guermantes had immoral relations with the Princesse de Parme; an indestructible legend, for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves, to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall. Given M. de Charlus\u2019s morals, the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the Baron\u2019s social position must be equally low, since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged, his title or his name. Just as Cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of Doctor of Medicine implied nothing, the title of Consultant to a Hospital meant something, so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twenty-five louis, and regained his importance only in the Faubourg Saint-Germain where he had three sisters who were Duchesses, for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account, but among the smart people who know what is what, that the great nobleman creates an effect. M. de Charlus, for that matter, was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain that the Verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so \u2018select\u2019 a household as theirs, the sculptor felt it his duty to take the Mistress aside. \u201cYou are entirely mistaken, besides I never pay any attention to those tales, and even if it were true, I may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, furious, for Morel being the principal feature of the Wednesdays, the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him. As for Cottard, he could not express an opinion, for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to \u2018do a little job\u2019 in thebuen retiro, and after that, in M. Verdurin\u2019s bedroom, to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great publisher from Paris who had come to call, expecting to be invited to stay to dinner, withdrew abruptly, quickly, realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan. He was a tall, stout man, very dark, with a studious and somewhat cutting air. He reminded one of an ebony paper-knife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin who, to welcome us in her immense drawing-room, in which displays of grasses, poppies, field-flowers, plucked only that morning, alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls, two centuries earlier, by an artist of exquisite taste, had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend, begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game, talking to us the while. What I told her about my impressions did not, however, seem altogether to please her. For one thing I was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff, and finer still from the terrace of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and which I would have travelled miles to see. \u201cYes, it\u2019s incomparable,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin carelessly, with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass. \u201cEven though we have it always in front of us, we never grow tired of it,\u201d and she turned her attention back to her cards. Now my very enthusiasm made me exacting. I expressed my regret that I could not see from the drawing-room the rocks of Darnetal, which, Elstir had told me, were quite lovely at that hour, when they reflected so many colours. \u201cAh! You can\u2019t see them from here, you would have to go to the end of the park, to the \u2018view of the bay.\u2019 From the seat there, you can take in the whole panorama. But you can\u2019t go there by yourself, you will lose your way. I can take you there, if you like,\u201d she added kindly. \u201cNo, no, you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day, you want to make yourself ill again. He will come back, he can see the view of the bay another time.\u201d I did not insist, and understood that it was enough for the Verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawing-room or dining-room, like a magnificent painting, like a priceless Japanese enamel, justifying the high rent that they were paying for la Raspeli\u00e8re, with plate and linen, but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes; the important thing, here, for them was to live comfortably, to take drives, to feed well, to talk, to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards, good meals, merry tea-parties. I noticed, however, later on, how intelligently they had learned to know the district, taking their guests for excursions as \u2018novel\u2019 as the music to which they made them listen. The part which the flowers of la Raspeli\u00e8re, the roads by the sea\u2019s edge, the old houses, the undiscovered churches, played in the life of M. Verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in Paris and who, themselves, substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life, or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes. This importance was further enhanced by the fact that the Verdurins were convinced that la Raspeli\u00e8re, which they hoped to purchase, was a property without its match in the world. This superiority which their self-esteem made them attribute to la Raspeli\u00e8re justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which, but for that, would have annoyed them slightly, because of the disappointments which it involved (like my disappointment when long ago I had first listened to Berma) and which I frankly admitted to them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear the carriage coming back,\u201d the Mistress suddenly murmured. Let us state briefly that Mme. Verdurin, quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years, no longer resembled what she had been at the time when Swann and Odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house. Even when she heard it played, she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then, for that had become her normal expression. Under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of Bach, Wagner, Vinteuil, Debussy had given her, Mme. Verdurin\u2019s brow had assumed enormous proportions, like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism. Her temples, suggestive of a pair of beautiful, pain-stricken, milk-white spheres, in which Harmony rolled endlessly, flung back upon either side her silvered tresses, and proclaimed, on the Mistress\u2019s behalf, without any need for her to say a word: \u201cI know what is in store for me to-night.\u201d Her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence, for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb. This attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by Beauty, and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata, had the result that Mme. Verdurin, even when listening to the most heartrending music, preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance, and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, here they are!\u201d M. Verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit Morel, followed by M. de Charlus. The latter, to whom dining with the Verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings, was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress. Moreover the persistent desire that M. de Charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome (when he appeared in the open doorway) by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious. When it is a Charlus, whether he be noble or plebeian, that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers, it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex, attendant like a goddess, or incarnate as a double, that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawing-room and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess. Thus a young painter, brought up by a godly, Protestant, female cousin, will enter a room, his head aslant and quivering, his eyes raised to the ceiling, his hands gripping an invisible muff, the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawing-room. Thus it was that the pious relative, whose memory is helping him to-day, used to enter a room years ago, and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce, when from her first words one realised, as now in the case of the painter, that she had come to pay an after-dinner call. By virtue of the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilise, adulterate, in a perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past, and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect, the one of Mme. Cottard\u2019s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune, radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain, it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex. He walked upon tiptoe, was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase, offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers, and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain, albeit he was bare-headed, whether his hat, as Mme. Cottard had once inquired of Swann, was not askew. As for M. de Charlus, whom the society in which he had lived furnished, at this critical moment, with different examples, with other patterns of affability, and above all with the maxim that one must, in certain cases, when dealing with people of humble rank, bring into play and make use of one\u2019s rarest graces, which one normally holds in reserve, it was with a flutter, archly, and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon Mme. Verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour. One would have thought that it was Mme. de Marsantes who was entering the room, so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of Nature had enshrined in the body of M. de Charlus. It was true that the Baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance. But no sooner had he succeeded than, he having in the meantime kept the same tastes, this habit of looking at things through a woman\u2019s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance, due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living. And as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view, and without noticing it, for it is not only by dint of lying to other people, but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying, albeit he had called upon his body to manifest (at the moment of his entering the Verdurins\u2019 drawing-room) all the courtesy of a great nobleman, that body which had fully understood what M. de Charlus had ceased to apprehend, displayed, to such an extent that the Baron would have deserved the epithet \u2018ladylike,\u2019 all the attractions of a great lady. Not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of M. de Charlus and the fact that sons, who do not always take after their fathers, even without being inverts, and though they go after women, may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers. But we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself: the Profanation of the Mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of M. de Charlus, and purely physical ferments set his material substance \u2018working\u2019 and made his body pass gradually into the category of women\u2019s bodies, nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin. By dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill, grow thin, are too weak to rise from your bed, suffer from nervous enteritis. By dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman, and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements. The obsession, just as in the other instance it affects your health, may in this instance alter your sex. Morel, who accompanied him, came to shake hands with me. From that first moment, owing to a twofold change that occurred in him I formed (alas, I was not warned in time to act upon it!) a bad impression of him. I have said that Morel, having risen above his father\u2019s menial status, was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity. He had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as Monsieur, treating me as an inferior. What was my surprise at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s to see him bow very low before me, and before me alone, and to hear, before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else, words of respect, most respectful \u2014 such words as I thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips \u2014 addressed to myself. I at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me. Taking me aside a minute later: \u201cMonsieur would be doing me a very great service,\u201d he said to me, going so far this time as to address me in the third person, \u201cby keeping from Mme. Verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle. It would be best to say that he was, in your family, the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents,\u201d Morel\u2019s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father\u2019s position, in which I took not the slightest interest, but the wealth \u2014 the apparent wealth of my own, which I felt to be absurd. But he appeared so unhappy, so pressing, that I could not refuse him. \u201cNo, before dinner,\u201d he said in an imploring tone, \u201cMonsieur can easily find some excuse for taking Mme. Verdurin aside.\u201d This was what, in the end, I did, trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of Morel\u2019s father, without unduly exaggerating the \u2018style,\u2019 the \u2018worldly goods\u2019 of my own family. It went like a letter through the post, notwithstanding the astonishment of Mme. Verdurin, who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather. And as she had no tact, hated family life (that dissolvent of the little nucleus), after telling me that she remembered, long ago, seeing my great-grandfather, and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot, who would have been incapable of understanding the little group, and who, to use her expression, \u201cwas not one of us,\u201d she said to me: \u201cFamilies are such a bore, the only thing is to get right away from them;\u201d and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my great-grandfather\u2019s character of which I was unaware, although I might have suspected it at home (I had never seen him, but they frequently spoke of him), his remarkable stinginess (in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my great-uncle, the friend of the lady in pink and Morel\u2019s father\u2019s employer): \u201cWhy, of course, if your grandparents had such a grand agent, that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family. Your grandfather\u2019s father was so stingy that, at the end of his life, when he was almost half-witted \u2014 between you and me, he was never anything very special, you are worth the whole lot of them \u2014 he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus. So that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him, and to let the old miser think that his friend M. de Persigny, the Cabinet Minister, had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses. But I am delighted to hear that our Morel\u2019s father held such a good position. I was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster, but that\u2019s nothing, I must have misunderstood. In any case, it makes not the slightest difference, for I must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth, the personal contribution, what I call the participation. Provided that a person is artistic, provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood, nothing else matters.\u201d The way in which Morel was one of the brotherhood was \u2014 so far as I have been able to discover \u2014 that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other. But what it is essential to note here is that as soon as I had given him my word that I would speak on his behalf to Mme. Verdurin, as soon, moreover, as I had actually done so, and without any possibility of subsequent retractation, Morel\u2019s \u2018respect\u2019 for myself vanished as though by magic, the formal language of respect melted away, and indeed for some time he avoided me, contriving to appear contemptuous of me, so that if Mme. Verdurin wanted me to give him a message, to ask him to play something, he would continue to talk to one of the faithful, then move on to another, changing his seat if I approached him. The others were obliged to tell him three or four times that I had spoken to him, after which he would reply, with an air of constraint, briefly, that is to say unless we were by ourselves. When that happened, he was expansive, friendly, for there was a charming side to him. I concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature, that he would not, at a pinch, shrink from any act of meanness, was incapable of gratitude. In which he resembled the majority of mankind. But inasmuch as I had inherited a strain of my grandmother\u2019s nature, and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did, I overlooked his baseness, rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence, and indeed in what I believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when, having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature, he realised (with a jerk, for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery) that my kindness to him was disinterested, that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness; and, more important still, I was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity, but which made me (without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician) hear again or for the first time so much good music. Moreover a manager \u2014 M. de Charlus (whom I had not suspected of such talents, albeit Mme. de Guermantes, who had known him a very different person in their younger days, asserted that he had composed a sonata for her, painted a fan, and so forth), modest in regard to his true merits, but possessing talents of the first order, contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold. Imagine a merely skilful performer in the Russian ballet, formed, educated, developed in all directions by M. Diaghileff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had just given Mme. Verdurin the message with which Morel had charged me and was talking to M. de Charlus about Saint-Loup, when Cottard burst into the room announcing, as though the house were on fire, that the Cambremers had arrived. Mme. Verdurin, not wishing to appear before strangers such as M. de Charlus (whom Cottard had not seen) and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the Cambremers, did not move, made no response to the announcement of these tidings, and merely said to the doctor, fanning herself gracefully, and adopting the tone of a Marquise in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cThe Baron has just been telling us. . . . \u201d This was too much for Cottard! Less abruptly than he would have done in the old days, for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance, but with the emotion, nevertheless, which he recaptured at the Verdurins\u2019, he exclaimed: \u201cA Baron! What Baron? Where\u2019s the Baron?\u201d staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity. Mme. Verdurin, with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has, in front of her guests, broken a valuable glass, and with the artificial, highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prize-winner acting in a play by the younger Dumas, replied, pointing with her fan to Morel\u2019s patron: \u201cWhy, the Baron de Charlus, to whom let me introduce you, M. le Professeur Cottard.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was, for that matter, by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady. M. de Charlus proffered two fingers which the Professor clasped with the kindly smile of a \u2018Prince of Science.\u2019 But he stopped short upon seeing the Cambremers enter the room, while M. de Charlus led me into a corner to tell me something, not without feeling my muscles, which is a German habit. M. de Cambremer bore no resemblance to the old Marquise. To anyone who had only heard of him, or of letters written by him, well and forcibly expressed, his personal appearance was startling. No doubt, one would grow accustomed to it. But his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth, perhaps the only crooked line, among so many, which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face, and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity, aggravated still further by the proximity of a Norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples. It is possible that the eyes of M. de Cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the Cotentin, so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching, drawn up by the roadside, and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars, but those eyelids, heavy, bleared and drooping, would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping. And so, discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance, one returned to the big crooked nose. By a transposition of the senses, M. de Cambremer looked at you with his nose. This nose of his was not ugly, it was if anything too handsome, too bold, too proud of its own importance. Arched, polished, gleaming, brand new, it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes. Unfortunately, if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed, the nose (to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest), the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propriety of the dark clothes which M. de Cambremer invariably wore, even in the morning, might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know; still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate\u2019s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority, as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of Alen\u00e7on, that on seeing M. de Cambremer one immediately felt oneself, even before one knew who he was, in the presence of a man of supreme distinction, of a man of perfect breeding, a change from the sort of person one saw at Balbec, a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely. He was to her, stifled by all those Balbec tourists who did not know her world, like a bottle of smelling salts. It seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as \u2018all wrong,\u2019 and that, as she had no conception of snobbishness, she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of Mlle. Legrandin, who must surely be difficult to please, having a brother who was \u2018so refined.\u2019 At best one might have said of M. de Cambremer\u2019s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition; one was reminded, on examining his faulty features, which one would have liked to correct, of those names of little Norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the cur\u00e9 was mistaken because the peasants, mispronouncing the names, or having misunderstood the Latin or Norman words that underlay them, have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies, as Brichot would have said, a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation. Life in these old towns may, for all that, be pleasant enough, and M. de Cambremer must have had his good points, for if it was in a mother\u2019s nature that the old Marquise should prefer her son to her daughter-in-law, on the other hand, she, who had other children, of whom two at least were not devoid of merit, was often heard to declare that the Marquis was, in her opinion, the best of the family. During the short time he had spent in the army, his messmates, finding Cambremer too long a name to pronounce, had given him the nickname Cancan, implying a flow of chatter, which he in no way merited. He knew how to brighten a dinner-party to which he was invited by saying when the fish (even if it were stale) or the entr\u00e9e came in: \u201cI say, that looks a fine animal.\u201d And his wife, who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs, put herself on the level of her husband\u2019s friends and perhaps sought to please him, like a mistress, and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence, by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers: \u201cYou shall see Cancan presently. Cancan has gone to Balbec, but he will be back this evening.\u201d She was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the Verdurins\u2019 and had done so only upon the entreaties of her mother-in-law and husband, in the hope of renewing the lease. But, being less well-bred than they, she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinner-party to her women friends. \u201cYou know we are going to dine with our tenants. That will be well worth an increased rent. As a matter of fact, I am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la Raspeli\u00e8re\u201d (as though she had been born in the house, and would find there all her old family associations). \u201cOur old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn\u2019t know the place. I can\u2019t bear to think of all that must be going on there. I am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again.\u201d She arrived haughty and morose, with the air of a great lady whose castle, owing to a state of war, is occupied by the enemy, but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding. Mme. de Cambremer could not see me at first for I was in a bay at the side of the room with M. de Charlus, who was telling me that he had heard from Morel that Morel\u2019s father had been an \u2018agent\u2019 in my family, and that he, Charlus, credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity (a term common to himself and Swann) to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots (I was warned) would not have failed, in my place, to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory. \u201cThe mere fact that I take an interest in him and extend my protection over him, gives him a pre-eminence and wipes out the past,\u201d the Baron concluded. As I listened to him and promised the silence which I would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous, I was looking at Mme. de Cambremer. And I had difficulty in recognising the melting, savoury morsel which I had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime, on the terrace at Balbec, in the Norman rock-cake that I now saw, hard as a rock, in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth. Irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother\u2019s simple kindliness, which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him, anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society, when Brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted, as she had seen her more fashionable friends do, but, anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world, she said, not, as she ought to have said: \u201cAllow me to introduce my husband,\u201d but: \u201cI introduce you to my husband,\u201d holding aloft thus the banner of the Cambremers, without avail, for her husband bowed as low before Brichot as she had expected. But all Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on M. de Charlus, whom she knew by sight. Never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction, even at the time of her intimacy with Swann. For as M. de Charlus always sided with the woman, with his sister-in-law against M. de Guermantes\u2019s mistresses, with Odette, at that time still unmarried, but an old flame of Swann\u2019s, against the new, he had, as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes, given Odette \u2014 and kept \u2014 the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to Mme. de Cambremer. She had certainly never guessed that it was at the Verdurins\u2019 that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person. M. de Cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her, so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied: \u201cYou are glad now you decided to come, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke very little, knowing that he had married a superior woman. \u201cI, all unworthy,\u201d he would say at every moment, and spontaneously quoted a fable of La Fontaine and one of Florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance, and at the same time enable him, beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery, to shew the men of science who were not members of the Jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables. The unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them. And so they kept cropping up. Mme. de Cambremer was no fool, but she had a number of extremely irritating habits. With her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain. She was not the person to say, like the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than Mme. de Cambremer from such an absurdity), with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name (albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach) of Julien de Monch\u00e2teau: \u201ca little Madame . . . Pica della Mirandola.\u201d No, when Mme. de Cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart, so as not to appear to know some damaging fact, and when, in her sincerity, she admitted it, she tried to conceal it by altering it. If, for instance, she was defending a woman, she would try to conceal the fact, while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth, that Madame So-and-so was at the moment the mistress of M. Sylvain Levy, and would say: \u201cNo . . . I know absolutely nothing about her, I fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name I don\u2019t know, something like Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn; anyhow, I believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them.\u201d This is an analogous, but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man, their listener will not immediately see that the expression (like her Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn) is interpolated, is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation, has a double meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin whispered in her husband\u2019s ear: \u201cShall I offer my arm to the Baron de Charlus? As you will have Mme. de Cambremer on your right, we might divide the honours.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201csince the other is higher in rank\u201d (meaning that M. de Cambremer was a Marquis), \u201cM. de Charlus is, strictly speaking, his inferior.\u201d \u201cVery well, I shall put him beside the Princess.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin introduced Mme. Sherbatoff to M. de Charlus; each of them bowed in silence, with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy. M. Verdurin introduced me to M. de Cambremer. Before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice, his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says: \u201cI have heard about you, I shall see what can be done; your punishment shall be remitted; we don\u2019t thirst for blood here; it will be all right.\u201d Then, as he shook my hand: \u201cI think you know my mother,\u201d he said to me. The word \u2018think\u2019 seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting, but not to imply any uncertainty, for he went on: \u201cI have a note for you from her.\u201d M. de Cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long. \u201cI am at home again,\u201d he said to Mme. Verdurin, while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors, and the marble busts on their high pedestals. He might, all the same, have felt himself at sea, for Mme. Verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own. In this respect, Mme. Verdurin, while regarded by the Cambremers as having turned everything upside down, was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand. They were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush, like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap, and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the Place Saint-Sulpice. Furthermore, a herb garden was beginning to take the place, in front of the mansion, of the borders that were the pride not merely of the Cambremers but of their gardener. The latter, who regarded the Cambremers as his sole masters, and groaned beneath the yoke of the Verdurins, as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army, went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress, grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias, begonias, house-leeks, double dahlias, and at anyone\u2019s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair. Mme. Verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind, if she took a long lease of la Raspeli\u00e8re or even bought the place, to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener, by whom his old mistress, on the contrary, set great store. He had worked for her without payment, when times were bad, he adored her; but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders, among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration, which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges, he used often to say of Mme. de Cambremer who, in \u201870, in a house that she owned in the East of France, surprised by the invasion, had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the Germans: \u201cWhat many people can\u2019t forgive Mme. la Marquise is that during the war she took the side of the Prussians and even had them to stay in her house. At any other time, I could understand it; but in war time, she ought not to have done it. It is not right.\u201d So that he was faithful to her unto death, venerated her for her goodness, and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason. Mme. Verdurin was annoyed that M. de Cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cYou must notice a good many changes, all the same,\u201d she replied. \u201cFor one thing there were those big bronze Barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which I packed off at once to the attic, though even that is too good a place for them.\u201d After this bitter retort to M. de Cambremer, she offered him her arm to go in to dinner. He hesitated for a moment, saying to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t, really, go in before M. de Charlus.\u201d But supposing the other to be an old friend of the house, seeing that he was not set in the post of honour, he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told Mme. Verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium (so it was that he styled the little nucleus, not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term). Cottard, who was seated next to M. de Charlus, beamed at him through his glass, to make his acquaintance and to break the ice, with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days, and not interrupted by fits of shyness. And these engaging glances, enhanced by the smile that accompanied them, were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides. The Baron, who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere, had no doubt that Cottard was one, and was making eyes at him. At once he turned on the Professor the cold shoulder of the invert, as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him. No doubt, albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure, always refused him by destiny, of being loved, it is a general law, the application of which is by no means confined to the Charlus type, that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable. To such a person, to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us, we prefer the society of any other, who has neither her charm, nor her looks, nor her brains. She will recover these, in our estimation, only when she has ceased to love us. In this light, we might see only the transposition, into odd terms, of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him. And so, whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels, the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it, as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman, M. de Charlus for instance by the Princesse de Guermantes, whose passion for him bored him, but flattered him. But when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them, then, whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own, or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking, which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it, is regarded as a vice, or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing, or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another, or from rage at being subjected, by the equivocal attitude of another person, to the injury which, by their own attitude, if that other person attracted them, they would not be afraid to inflict on him, the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles, never taking their eyes off him in the theatre, even if he is with friends, and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them, may be heard, if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them, to say: \u201cSir, for what do you take me?\u201d (simply because he takes them for what they are) \u201cI don\u2019t understand, no, don\u2019t attempt to explain, you are quite mistaken,\u201d pass if need be from words to blows, and, to a person who knows the imprudent stranger, wax indignant: \u201cWhat, you know that loathsome creature. He stares at one so! . . . A fine way to behave!\u201d M. de Charlus did not go quite as far as this, but assumed the offended, glacial air adopted, when one appears to be suspecting them, by women who are not of easy virtue, even more by women who are. Furthermore, the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which, being purely inanimate, could at the worst only injure his self-esteem, but a second self, living, acting in the same sphere, capable therefore of injuring him in his loves. And so it is from an instinct of self-preservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival, whether to people who are able to do him some injury (nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case), or to the young man whom he has \u2018picked up,\u2019 who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person. To M. de Charlus, who was thinking perhaps of the \u2014 wholly imaginary \u2014 dangers in which the presence of this Cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve Morel, an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself, but was a deliberate rival. A tradesman, practising an uncommon trade, who, on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that, in the same square, directly opposite, the same trade is being carried on by a competitor, is no more discomfited than a Charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and, on the day of his arrival, catches sight of the local squire or the barber, whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt. The tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred; this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy, and, if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity, one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place. The invert\u2019s rage is even more agonising. He has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion. Even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him, he is obliged, like Harpagon, to watch over his treasure, and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen. And it is this no doubt that, even more than desire, or the convenience of habits shared in common, and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience, makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible. He may be mistaken for a moment, but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth. And so M. de Charlus\u2019s error was brief. His divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that Cottard was not of his kind, and that he need not fear his advances either for himself, which would merely have annoyed him, or for Morel, which would have seemed to him a more serious matter. He recovered his calm, and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of Venus Androgyne, now and again, he smiled a faint smile at the Verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth, merely curving his lips at one corner, and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes, he so obsessed with virility, exactly as his sister-in-law the Duchesse de Guermantes might have done. \u201cDo you shoot much, Sir?\u201d said M. Verdurin with a note of contempt to M. de Cambremer. \u201cHas Ski told you of the near shave we had to-day?\u201d Cottard inquired of the mistress. \u201cI shoot mostly in the forest of Chantepie,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cNo, I have told her nothing,\u201d said Ski. \u201cDoes it deserve its name?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Cambremer, after a glance at me from the corner of his eye, for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations, begging me at the same time not to let the Cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the Combray cur\u00e9. \u201cI am afraid I must be very stupid, but I don\u2019t grasp your question,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cI mean to say: do many pies sing in it?\u201d replied Brichot. Cottard meanwhile could not bear Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train. \u201cOut with it,\u201d Mme. Cottard said to her husband encouragingly, \u201ctell us your odyssey.\u201d \u201cWell, really, it is quite out of the Ordinary,\u201d said the doctor, and repeated his narrative from the beginning. \u201cWhen I saw that the train was in the station, I stood thunderstruck. It was all Ski\u2019s fault. You are somewhat wide of the mark in your information, my dear fellow! And there was Brichot waiting for us at the station!\u201d \u201cI assumed,\u201d said the scholar, casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips, \u201cthat if you had been detained at Graincourt, it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue, if my wife were to hear you!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis wife of mine, it is jealous.\u201d \u201cAh! That Brichot,\u201d cried Ski, moved to traditional merriment by Brichot\u2019s spicy witticism, \u201che is always the same;\u201d albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity. And, to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture, he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch Brichot\u2019s leg. \u201cHe never changes, the rascal,\u201d Ski went on, and without stopping to think of the effect, at once tragic and comic, that the don\u2019s semi-blindness gave to his words: \u201cAlways a sharp look-out for the ladies.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, \u201cwhat it is to meet with a scholar. Here have I been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of Chantepie, and I\u2019ve never even thought of what the name meant.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband; she did not like him to humble himself thus before Brichot. She was even more annoyed when, at every \u2018ready-made\u2019 expression that Cancan employed, Cottard, who knew the ins and outs of them all, having himself laboriously acquired them, pointed out to the Marquis, who admitted his stupidity, that they meant nothing. \u201cWhy \u2018stupid as a cabbage?\u2019 Do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else? You say:\u2018repeat the same thing thirty-six times.\u2019 Why thirty-six? Why do you say:\u2018sleep like a top?\u2019 Why \u2018Thunder of Brest?\u2019 Why \u2018play four hundred tricks?\u2019\u201d But at this, the defence of M. de Cambremer was taken up by Brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions. But Mme. de Cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the Verdurins had introduced at la Raspeli\u00e8re, in order that she might be able to criticise some, and import others, or possibly the same ones, to F\u00e9terne. \u201cI keep wondering what that lustre is that\u2019s hanging all crooked. I can hardly recognise my old Raspeli\u00e8re,\u201d she went on, with a familiarly aristocratic air, as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle. And, as she was a trifle bookish in her speech: \u201cAll the same,\u201d she added in an undertone, \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that if I were inhabiting another person\u2019s house, I should feel some compunction about altering everything like this.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity you didn\u2019t come with them,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to M. de Charlus and Morel, hoping that M. de Charlus was now \u2018enrolled\u2019 and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train. \u201cYou are sure that Chantepie means the singing magpie, Chochotte?\u201d she went on, to shew that, like the great hostess that she was, she could join in every conversation at the same time. \u201cTell me something about this violinist,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me, \u201che interests me; I adore music, and it seems to me that I have heard of him before, complete my education.\u201d She had heard that Morel had come with M. de Charlus and hoped, by getting the former to come to her house, to make friends with the latter. She added, however, so that I might not guess her reason for asking, \u201cM. Brichot, too, interests me.\u201d For, even if she was highly cultivated, just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything, and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter, so Mme. de Cambremer might in vain master, and especially at F\u00e9terne, a philosophy that became ever more esoteric, music that became ever more subtle, she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middle-class friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her \u2018in laws,\u2019 and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote. A philosopher who was not modern enough for her, Leibnitz, has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart. This way Mme. de Cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing. Abandoning the study of John Stuart Mill only for that of Lachelier, the less she believed in the reality of the external world, the more desperately she sought to establish herself, before she died, in a good position in it. In her passion for realism in art, no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer. A fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick; Tolstoi\u2019s mujiks, or Millet\u2019s peasants, were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass. But to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations, to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with Duchesses, this was the goal of all her efforts, so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself, by the study of great masterpieces, proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her. This snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined, just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies. I could not, all the same, refrain, as I listened to her, from giving her credit, without deriving any pleasure from them, for the refinement of her expressions. They were those that are used, at a given date, by all the people of the same intellectual breadth, so that the refined expression provides us at once, like the arc of a circle, with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference. And so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately, because I feel that I already know them, but are generally regarded as superior persons, and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions. \u201cYou cannot fail to be aware, Madame, that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them. Next to the forest of Chantepie, you have the wood Chantereine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who the queen may be, but you are not very polite to her,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cOne for you, Chochotte,\u201d said Mme. de Verdurin. \u201cAnd apart from that, did you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cWe encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train. But I must answer M. de Cambremer\u2019s question; reine, in this instance, is not the wife of a king, but a frog. It is the name that the frog has long retained in this district, as is shewn by the station, Renneville, which ought to be spelt Reineville.\u201d \u201cI say, that seems a fine animal,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin, pointing to a fish. (It was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinner-party, and gave an immediate return of hospitality. \u201cThere is no need to invite them,\u201d he would often say, in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife. \u201cThey were delighted to have us. It was they that thanked me for coming.\u201d) \u201cI must tell you, all the same, that I have been going every day for years to Renneville, and I have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else. Madame de Cambremer brought the cur\u00e9 here from a parish where she owns a considerable property, who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself, it seems to me. He has written a book.\u201d \u201cI know, I have read it with immense interest,\u201d Brichot replied hypocritically. The satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made M. de Cambremer laugh long and loud. \u201cAh! well, the author of, what shall I say, this geography, this glossary, dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly, if I may say so, the Lords, and which is called Pont-a-Couleuvre. Of course I am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning, but I have been to Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre a thousand times if he\u2019s been there once, and devil take me if I ever saw one of his beastly serpents there, I say beastly, in spite of the tribute the worthy La Fontaine pays them.\u201d (The Man and the Serpent was one of his two fables.) \u201cYou have not seen any, and you have been quite right,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cUndoubtedly, the writer you mention knows his subject through and through, he has written a remarkable book.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cthat book, there\u2019s no other word for it, is a regular Benedictine opus.\u201d \u201cNo doubt he has consulted various polyptychs (by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese), which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators. But there are other sources. One of the most learned of my friends has delved into them. He found that the place in question was named Pont-a-Quileuvre. This odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther, to a Latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled Pons cui aperit: A closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment.\u201d \u201cYou were speaking of frogs. I, when I find myself among such learned folk, feel like the frog before the areopagus,\u201d (this being his other fable) said Cancan who often indulged, with a hearty laugh, in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making, at one and the same time, out of humility and with aptness, a profession of ignorance and a display of learning. As for Cottard, blocked upon one side by M. de Charlus\u2019s silence, and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere, he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies; if on the other hand it missed the mark, it enabled him to check certain theories, to widen his previous point of view. \u201cWhen you come to a relatively high altitude, such as this where we now are, do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits?\u201d he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge. M. de Cambremer heard the question and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amused I am to hear that you have choking fits,\u201d he flung at me across the table. He did not mean that it made him happy, though as a matter of fact it did. For this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person\u2019s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart. But his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause my sister has them too.\u201d And indeed it did amuse him, as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house. \u201cHow small the world is,\u201d was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which I saw written upon his smiling face when Cottard spoke to me of my choking fits. And these began to establish themselves, from the evening of this dinner-party, as a sort of interest in common, after which M. de Cambremer never failed to inquire, if only to hand on a report to his sister. As I answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about Morel, my thoughts returned to a conversation I had had with my mother that afternoon. Having, without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the Verdurins\u2019 if there was a chance of my being amused there, suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved, which would have made him exclaim: \u201cOn guard!\u201d my mother had gone on to say: \u201cListen, Judge Toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with Mme. Bon-temps. They asked me no questions. But I seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to Albertine would be the joy of her aunt\u2019s life. I think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you. At the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her, the sort of friends they more or less know that we have, all that is not, I fancy, left out of account, although it may be a minor consideration. I should not have mentioned it to you myself, because I attach no importance to it, but as I imagine that people will mention it to you, I prefer to get a word in first.\u201d \u201cBut you yourself, what do you think of her?\u201d I asked my mother. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not I that am going to marry her. You might certainly do a thousand times better. But I feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you. As a matter of fact, I cannot tell you what I think of Albertine; I don\u2019t think of her. I shall say to you, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u2018She has good qualities, at least I suppose so. But at this first stage I can praise her only by negatives. One thing she is not, she has not the Rennes accent. In time, I shall perhaps say, she is something else. And I shall always think well of her if she can make you happy.\u2019\u201d But by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness, my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which I had been plunged long ago when, my father having allowed me to go to Ph\u00e8dre and, what was more, to take to writing, I had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility, the fear of distressing him, and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer, to begin by regarding Albertine as in the past, so as to find out whether I really loved her. I might take her, as a distraction, to see the Verdurins, and this thought reminded me that I had come there myself that evening only to learn whether Mme. Putbus was staying there or was expected. In any case, she was not dining with them. \u201cSpeaking of your friend Saint-Loup,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose, for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the Guermantes; \u201cyou know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the Princesse de Guermantes. I may tell you that, so far as I am concerned, all that society gossip leaves me cold.\u201d I was seized by a fear that I might have spoken unfeelingly to Robert about the girl in question, a girl full of sham originality, whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent. Hardly ever do we hear anything that does \u2018not make us regret something that we have said. I replied to Mme. de Cambremer, truthfully as it happened, that I knew nothing about it, and that anyhow I thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged. \u201cThat is perhaps why it is not yet official, anyhow there is a lot of talk about it.\u201d \u201cI ought to warn you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin observed dryly to Mme. de Cambremer, having heard her talking to me about Morel and supposing, when Mme. de Cambremer lowered her voice to speak of Saint-Loup\u2019s engagement, that Morel was still under discussion. \u201cYou needn\u2019t expect any light music here. In matters of art, you know, the faithful who come to my Wednesdays, my children as I call them, are all fearfully advanced,\u201d she added with an air of proud terror. \u201cI say to them sometimes: My dear people, you move too fast for your Mistress, not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring. Every year it goes a little farther; I can see the day coming when they will have no more use for Wagner or Indy.\u201d \u201cBut it is splendid to be advanced, one can never be advanced enough,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the dining-room, trying to identify the things that her mother-in-law had left there, those that Mme. Verdurin had brought with her, and to convict the latter red-handed of want of taste. At the same time, she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most, M. de Charlus. She thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist. \u201cHe seems intelligent.\u201d \u201cWhy, his mind is extremely active for a man of his age,\u201d said I. \u201cAge? But he doesn\u2019t seem at all old, look, the hair is still young.\u201d (For, during the last three or four years, the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions, and everybody at the same radius from the centre as Mme. de Cambremer would say \u2018the hair,\u2019 not without an affected smile. At the present day, people still say \u2018the hair\u2019 but, from an excessive use of the article, the pronoun will be born again.) \u201cWhat interests me most about M. de Charlus,\u201d she went on, \u201cis that one can feel that he has the gift. I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. Things that can be learned do not interest me.\u201d This speech was not incompatible with Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s own distinction which was, in the fullest sense, imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme. de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. \u201cThat is why,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cBrichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition, interests me far less.\u201d But Brichot, at that moment, was occupied with one thing only; hearing people talk about music, he trembled lest the subject should remind Mme. Verdurin of the death of Dechambre. He decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory. M. de Cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question: \u201cYou mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Brichot, proud to display his learning before so many strangers, among whom, I had told him, he would be certain to interest one at least. \u201cWe have only to consider how often, even in the names of people, a tree is preserved, like a fern in a piece of coal. One of our Conscript Fathers is called M. de Saulces de Freycinet, which means, if I be not mistaken, a spot planted with willows and ashes, salix et fraxinetum; his nephew M. de Selves combines more trees still, since he is named de Selves, de sylvis.\u201d Saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn. He could, since Brichot was talking all the time, preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of M. and Mme. Verdurin\u2019s wit. And growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free, he had been touched when he heard M. Verdurin, notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinner-party, tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of M. Saniette who never drank anything else. (The generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed.) Moreover, Mme. Verdurin had actually smiled once at Saniette. Decidedly, they were kind people. He was not going to be tortured any more. At this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom I have forgotten to mention, an eminent Norwegian philosopher who spoke French very well but very slowly, for the twofold reason that, in the first place, having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes (he did, nevertheless, make some), he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary, and secondly, being a metaphysician, he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it, which, even in a Frenchman, causes slowness of utterance. He was, otherwise, a charming person, although similar in appearance to many other people, save in one respect. This man so slow in his diction (there was an interval of silence after every word) acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said good-bye. His haste made one suppose, the first time one saw him, that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear \u2014 colleague,\u201d he said to Brichot, after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term, \u201cI have a sort of \u2014 desire to know whether there are other trees in the \u2014 nomenclature of your beautiful French \u2014 Latin \u2014 Norman tongue. Madame\u201d (lie meant Madame Verdurin, although he dared not look at her) \u201chas told me that you know everything. Is not this precisely the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, it is the moment for eating,\u201d interrupted Mme. Verdurin, who saw the dinner becoming interminable. \u201cVery well,\u201d the Scandinavian replied, bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile. \u201cBut I must point out to Madame that if I have permitted myself this questionnaire \u2014 pardon me, this questation \u2014 it is because I have to return to-morrow to Paris to dine at the Tour d\u2019Argent or at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, My French \u2014 brother \u2014 M. Boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism \u2014 pardon me, certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled.\u201d \u201cThe Tour d\u2019Argent is not nearly as good as they make out,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin sourly. \u201cIn fact, I have had some disgusting dinners there.\u201d \u201cBut am I mistaken, is not the food that one consumes at Madame\u2019s table an example of the finest French cookery?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not positively bad,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, sweetening. \u201cAnd if you come next Wednesday, it will be better.\u201d \u201cBut I am leaving on Monday for Algiers, and from there I am going to the Cape. And when I am at the Cape of Good Hope, I shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague \u2014 pardon me, I shall no longer be able to meet my brother.\u201d And he set to work obediently, after offering these retrospective apologies, to devour his food at a headlong pace. But Brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies, and replied, so greatly interesting the Norwegian that he again stopped eating, but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course. \u201cOne of the Forty,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cis named Houssaye, or a place planted with hollies; in the name of a brilliant diplomat, d\u2019Ormesson, you will find the elm, theulmus beloved of Virgil, which has given its name to the town of Ulm; in the names of his colleagues, M. de la Boulaye, the birch (bouleau), M. d\u2019Aunay, the alder (aune), M. de Buissi\u00e8re, the box (buis), M. Albaret, the sapwood (aubier)\u201d (I made a mental note that I must tell this to C\u00e9leste), \u201cM. de Cholet, the cabbage (chou), and the apple-tree (pommier) in the name of M. de la Pommeraye, whose lectures we used to attend, do you remember, Saniette, in the days when the worthy Porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth, as Proconsul in Odeonia?\u201d \u201cYou said that Cholet was derived from chou,\u201d I remarked to Brichot. \u201cAm I to suppose that the name of a station I passed before reaching Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Frichoux, comes from chou also?\u201d \u201cNo, Saint-Frichoux is Sanctus Fruc-tuosus, asSanctus Ferreolus gave rise to Saint-Fargeau, but that is not Norman in the least.\u201d \u201cHe knows too much, he\u2019s boring us,\u201d the Princess muttered softly. \u201cThere are so many other names that interest me, but I can\u2019t ask you everything at once.\u201d And, turning to Cottard, \u201cIs Madame Putbus here?\u201d I asked him. On hearing Brichot utter the name of Saniette, M. Verdurin cast at his wife and at Cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest. \u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, who had overheard my question, \u201cI have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of Venice, we are rid of her for this year.\u201d \u201cI shall myself be entitled presently to two trees,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cfor I have more or less taken a little house between Saint-Martin-du-Chene and Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs.\u201d \u201cBut that is quite close to here, I hope that you will come over often with Charlie Morel. You have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains, you are only a step from Donci\u00e8res,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who hated people\u2019s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them. She knew how stiff the climb was to la Raspeli\u00e8re, even if you took the zigzag path, behind F\u00e9terne, which was half-an-hour longer; she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them, or even, having in reality stayed away, might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at Douville-F\u00e9terne, and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot. To this invitation M. de Charlus responded with a silent bow. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week, he seems a tough customer,\u201d the doctor whispered to Ski, for having remained quite simple, notwithstanding a surface-dressing of pride, he made no attempt to conceal the fact that Charlus had snubbed him. \u201cHe is doubtless unaware that at all the watering-places, and even in Paris in the wards, the physicians, who naturally regard me as their \u2018chief,\u2019 make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present, not that they need to be asked twice. It makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable,\u201d he added carelessly. \u201cIndeed at Donci\u00e8res the medical officer of the regiment, who is the doctor who attends the Colonel, invited me to luncheon to meet him, saying that I was fully entitled to dine with the General. And that General is a Monsieur de something. I don\u2019t know whether his title-deeds are more or less ancient than those of this Baron.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him, his is a very humble coronet,\u201d replied Ski in an undertone, and added some vague statement including a word of which I caught only the last syllable, -ast, being engaged in listening to what Brichot was saying to M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, as for that, I am sorry to say, you have probably one tree only, for if Saint-Martin-du-Ch\u00eane is obviouslySanctus Martinus juxta quercum, on the other hand, the word if may be simply the root ave, eve, which means moist, as in Aveyron, Lod\u00e8ve, Yvette, and which you see survive in our kitchen-sinks (\u00e9viers). It is the word eau which in Breton is represented by ster, Ster-maria, Sterlaer, Sterbouest, Ster-en-Dreuchen.\u201d I heard no more, for whatever the pleasure I might feel on hearing again the name Stermaria, I could not help listening to Cottard, next to whom I was seated, as he murmured to Ski: \u201cIndeed! I was not aware of it. So he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind! He is one of the happy band, is he? He hasn\u2019t got rings of fat round his eyes, all the same. I shall have to keep my feet well under me, or he may start squeezing them. But I\u2019m not at all surprised. I am used to seeing noblemen in the bath, in their birthday suits, they are all more or less degenerates. I don\u2019t talk to them, because after all I am in an official position and it might do me harm. But they know quite well who I am.\u201d Saniette, whom Brichot\u2019s appeal had frightened, was beginning to breathe again, like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder, when he heard M. Verdurin interrogate him, fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking, so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure. \u201cBut you never told us that you went to those matin\u00e9es at the Od\u00e9on, Saniette?\u201d Trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant, Saniette replied, making his speech as diminutive as possible, so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow: \u201cOnly once, to the Chercheuse.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that he says?\u201d shouted M. Verdurin, with an air of disgust and fury combined, knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible. \u201cIt is impossible to understand what you say, what have you got in your mouth?\u201d inquired M. Verdurin, growing more and more furious, and alluding to Saniette\u2019s defective speech. \u201cPoor Saniette, I won\u2019t have him made unhappy,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin in a tone of false pity, so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband\u2019s insolent intention. \u201cI was at the Ch . . . Che..\u201d \u201cChe, che, try to speak distinctly,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word you say.\u201d Almost without exception, the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man\u2019s skin has aroused the thirst for blood. For the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike. And we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of, which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired. It is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings. \u201cCome, now, it is not his fault,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIt is not mine either, people ought not to dine out if they can\u2019t speak properly.\u201d \u201cI was at the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit by Favart.\u201d \u201cWhat! It\u2019s theChercheuse d\u2019Esprit that you call the Chercheuse? Why, that\u2019s marvellous! I might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it,\u201d cried M. Verdurin, who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary, were not artistic, were not \u2018one of us,\u2019 if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works. For instance, one was expected to say the Malade, the Bourgeois; and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand \u2018shop,\u2019 just as in a drawing-room a person proves that he is not in society by saying \u2018M. de Montesquiou-F\u00e9zensac\u2019 instead of \u2018M. de Montesquieu.\u2019 \u201cBut it is not so extraordinary,\u201d said Saniette, breathless with emotion but smiling, albeit he was in no smiling mood. Mme. Verdurin could not contain herself. \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d she cried with a titter. \u201cYou may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d M. Verdurin went on in a gentler tone, addressing both Saniette and Brichot: \u201cIt is quite a pretty piece, all the same, the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d Uttered in a serious tone, this simple phrase, in which one could detect no trace of malice, did Saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment. He was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence. Brichot was more loquacious. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he replied to M. Verdurin, \u201cand if it could be passed off as the work of some Sarmatian or Scandinavian author, we might put forward the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece. But, be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle Favart, he had not the Ibsenian temperament.\u201d (Immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair, remembering the Norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that Brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name Bussi\u00e8re.) \u201cHowever, now that Porel\u2019s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a Tolstoist of rigorous observance, it may come to pass that we shall witnessAnna Karenina or Resurrection beneath the Od\u00e9onian architrave.\u201d \u201cI know the portrait of Favart to which you allude,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI have seen a very fine print of it at Comtesse Mol\u00e9\u2018s.\u201d The name of Comtesse Mol\u00e9 made a great impression upon Mme. Verdurin. \u201cOh! So you go to Mme. de Mol\u00e9\u2018s!\u201d she exclaimed. She supposed that people said Comtesse Mol\u00e9, Madame Mol\u00e9, simply as an abbreviation, as she heard people say \u2018the Rohans\u2019 or in contempt, as she herself said: \u2018Madame la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2019 She had no doubt that Comtesse Mol\u00e9, who knew the Queen of Greece and the Principessa di Caprarola, had as much right as anybody to the particle, and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage, and one who had been extremely civil to herself. And so, to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the Comtesse her \u2018de,\u2019 she went on: \u201cBut I had no idea that you knew Madame de Mol\u00e9!\u201d as though it had been doubly extraordinary, both that M. de Charlus should know the lady, and that Mme. Verdurin should not know that he knew her. Now society, or at least the people to whom M. de Charlus gave that name, forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole. And so it is comprehensible that, in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes, a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends: \u201cBut how in the world do you come to know him?\u201d whereas to be surprised at a Frenchman\u2019s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together M. de Charlus and the Comtesse Mol\u00e9. What is more, even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society, how could there be anything strange in the fact of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing of it, since she was meeting M. de Charlus for the first time, and his relations with Mme. Mol\u00e9 were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him, about whom, to tell the truth, she knew nothing. \u201cWho was it that played this Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit, my good Saniette?\u201d asked M. Verdurin. Albeit he felt that the storm had passed, the old antiquarian hesitated before answering. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou frighten him, you make fun of everything that he says, and then you expect him to answer. Come along, tell us who played the part, and you shall have some galantine to take home,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, making a cruel allusion to the penury into which Saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend. \u201cI can remember only that it was Mme. Samary who played the Zerbine,\u201d said Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine? What in the world is that,\u201d M. Verdurin shouted, as though the house were on fire. \u201cIt is one of the parts in the old repertory, like Captain Fracasse, as who should say the Fire-eater, the Pedant.\u201d \u201cAh, the pedant, that\u2019s yourself. The Zerbine! No, really the man\u2019s mad,\u201d exclaimed M. Verdurin. Mme. Verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine, he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means. You are like M. de Longepierre, the stupidest man I know, who said to us quite calmly the other day \u2018the Banat.\u2019 Nobody had any idea what he meant. Finally we were informed that it was a province in Serbia.\u201d To put an end to Saniette\u2019s torture, which hurt me \u2018more than it hurt him, I asked Brichot if he knew what the word Balbec meant. \u201cBalbec is probably a corruption of Dalbec,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne would have to consult the charters of the Kings of England, Overlords of Normandy, for Balbec was held of the Barony of Dover, for which reason it was often styled Balbec d\u2019Outre-Mer, Balbec-en-Terre. But the Barony of Dover was itself held of the Bishopric of Bayeux, and, notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the Templars, from the time of Louis d\u2019Harcourt, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Bishop of Bayeux; it was the Bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of Balbec. So it was explained to me by the incumbent of Douville, a bald person, eloquent, fantastic, and a devotee of the table, who lives by the Rule of Brillat-Savarin, and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy, while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes.\u201d While Brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things, Saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen. The witty remark was what was known as a \u2018comparison,\u2019 but had changed its form, for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles, an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another, and so forth. . . . At one time the typical \u2018comparison\u2019 was the \u2018height of. . . . \u2019 But this was out of date, no one used it any more, there was only Cottard left to say still, on occasion, in the middle of a game of piquet: \u201cDo you know what is the height of absent-mindedness, it is to think that the Edict (l\u2019edit) of Nantes was an Englishwoman.\u201d These \u2018heights\u2019 had been replaced by nicknames. In reality it was still the old \u2018comparison,\u2019 but, as the nickname was in fashion, people did not observe the survival. Unfortunately for Saniette, when these \u2018comparisons\u2019 were not his own, and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus, he produced them so timidly that, notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature, nobody saw the point. And if on the other hand the joke was his own, as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful, and the latter had repeated it, appropriating the authorship, the joke was in that case known, but not as being Saniette\u2019s. And so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised, but, because he was its author, he was accused of plagiarism. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d Brichot continued, \u201cBee, in Norman, is a stream; there is the Abbey of Bee, Mobec, the stream from the marsh (Mor or Mer meant a marsh, as in Morville, or in Bricquemar, Alvimare, Cambremer), Bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from Briga, a fortified place, as in Bricqueville, Bricquebose, le Bric, Briand, or indeed Brice, bridge, which is the same asbruck in German (Innsbruck), and as the English  which ends so many place-names (Cambridge, for instance). You have moreover in Normandy many other instances of bec: Caudebec, Bolbec, le Robec, le Bec-Hellouin, Becquerel. It is the Norman form of the German bach Offenbach, Anspach. Varaguebec, from the old word varaigne, equivalent to warren, preserved woods or ponds. As for Dal,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit is a form of thal, a valley: Darnetal, Rosendal, and indeed, close to Louviers, Becdal. The river that has given its name to Balbec, is, by the way, charming. Seen from a falaise (fels in German, you have indeed, not far from here, standing on a height, the picturesque town of Falaise), it runs close under the spires of the church, which is actually a long way from it, and seems to be reflecting them.\u201d \u201cI should think,\u201d said I, \u201cthat is an effect that Elstir admires greatly. I have seen several sketches of it in his studio.\u201d \u201cElstir! You know Tiche,\u201d cried Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut do you know that we used to be the dearest friends? Thank heaven, I never see him now. No, but ask Cottard, Brichot, he used to have his place laid at my table, he came every day. Now, there\u2019s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus. I shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me; you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now, which I don\u2019t care for at all, not at all! Why! I made him do me a portrait of Cottard, not to mention all the sketches he has made of me.\u201d \u201cAnd he gave the Professor purple hair,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a Fellow of the College. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir, whether you find that my husband has purple hair.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, raising her chin with an air of contempt for Mme. Cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking, \u201che was a brave colourist, a fine painter. Whereas,\u201d she added, turning again to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you call it painting, all those huge she-devils of composition, those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me. For my part, I call it daubing, it\u2019s all so hackneyed, and besides, it lacks relief, personality. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHe revives the grace of the eighteenth century, but in a modern form,\u201d Saniette broke out, fortified and reassured by my affability. \u201cBut I prefer Helleu.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not in the least like Helleu,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cYes, he has the fever of the eighteenth century. He\u2019s a steam Watteau,\u201d and he began to laugh. \u201cOld, old as the hills, I\u2019ve had that served up to me for years,\u201d said M. Verdurin, to whom indeed Ski had once repeated the remark, but as his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible, it is not your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, \u201cbecause he was really gifted, he has wasted a charming temperament for painting. Ah! if he had stayed with us! Why, he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day. And it is a woman that has dragged him down so low! Not that that surprises me, for he was a pleasant enough man, but common. At bottom, he was a mediocrity. I may tell you that I felt it at once. Really, he never interested me. I was very fond of him, that was all. For one thing, he was so dirty. Tell me, do you, now, really like people who never wash?\u201d \u201cWhat is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating?\u201d asked Ski. \u201cIt is called strawberry mousse,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut it is ex-qui-site. You ought to open bottles of Ch\u00e2teau-Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, port wine.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how he amuses me, he never drinks anything but water,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay. \u201cBut not to drink,\u201d Ski went on, \u201cyou shall fill all our glasses, they will bring in marvelous peaches, huge nectarines, there against the sunset; it will be as gorgeous as a fine Veronese.\u201d \u201cIt would cost almost as much,\u201d M. Verdurin murmured. \u201cBut take away those cheeses with their hideous colour,\u201d said Ski, trying to snatch the plate from before his host, who defended his gruy\u00e8re with his might and main. \u201cYou can realise that I don\u2019t regret Elstir,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to me, \u201cthat one is far more gifted. Elstir is simply hard work, the man who can\u2019t make himself give up painting when he would like to. He is the good student, the slavish competitor. Ski, now, only follows his own fancy. You will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner.\u201d \u201cAfter all, I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t invite his wife,\u201d said Cottard, \u201che would be with us still.\u201d \u201cWill you mind what you\u2019re saying, please, I don\u2019t open my doors to street-walkers, Monsieur le Professeur,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who had, on the contrary, done everything in her power to make Elstir return, even with his wife. But before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel, had told Elstir that the woman he loved was stupid, dirty, immoral, a thief. For once in a way she had failed to effect a breach. It was with the Verdurin salon that Elstir had broken; and he was glad of it, as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation. \u201cHe really is magnificent, the Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not declare outright that I keep a disorderly house? Anyone would think you didn\u2019t know what Madame Elstir was like. I would sooner have the lowest street-walker at my table! Oh no, I don\u2019t stand for that sort of thing. Besides I may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife, when the husband no longer interests me, he is out of date, he can\u2019t even draw.\u201d \u201cThat is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceven at the time when he had talent, for he had it, the wretch, and to spare, what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence.\u201d Mme. Verdurin, in passing this judgment upon Elstir, had not waited for their quarrel, or until she had ceased to care for his painting. The fact was that, even at the time when he formed part of the little group, it would happen that Elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom, rightly or wrongly, Mme. Verdurin considered a goose, which, in her opinion, was not the conduct of an intelligent man. \u201cNo,\u201d she observed with an air of finality, \u201cI consider that his wife and he are made for one another. Heaven knows, there isn\u2019t a more boring creature on the face of the earth, and I should go mad if I had to spend a couple of hours with her. But people say that he finds her very intelligent. There\u2019s no use denying it, our Tiche was extremely stupid. I have seen him bowled over by people you can\u2019t conceive, worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan. Well! He wrote to them, he argued with them, he, Elstir! That doesn\u2019t prevent his having charming qualities, oh, charming and deliciously absurd, naturally.\u201d For Mme. Verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies. A false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth. Certainly, people\u2019s follies are insupportable. But a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted. So that the oddities of charming people exasperate us, but there are few if any charming people who are not, at the same time, odd. \u201cLook, I shall be able to shew you his flowers now,\u201d she said to me, seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise. And she took M. de Cambremer\u2019s arm again. M. Verdurin tried to apologise for this to M. de Charlus, as soon as he had got rid of Mme. de Cambremer, and to give him his reasons, chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title, momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled. But first of all he was anxious to make it clear to M. de Charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities. \u201cExcuse my mentioning so small a point,\u201d he began, \u201cfor I can understand how little such things mean to you. Middle-class minds pay attention to them, but the others, the artists, the people who are really of our sort, don\u2019t give a rap for them. Now, from the first words we exchanged, I realised that you were one of us!\u201d M. de Charlus, who gave a widely different meaning to this expression, drew himself erect. After the doctor\u2019s oglings, he found his host\u2019s insulting frankness suffocating. \u201cDon\u2019t protest, my dear Sir, you are one of us, it is plain as daylight,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. \u201cObserve that I have no idea whether you practise any of the arts, but that is not necessary. It is not always sufficient. Dechambre, who has just died, played exquisitely, with the most vigorous execution, but he was not one of us, you felt at once that he was not one of us. Brichot is not one of us. Morel is, my wife is, I can feel that you are. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201d interrupted M. de Charlus, who was beginning to feel reassured as to M. Verdurin\u2019s meaning, but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud. \u201cOnly that we put you on the left,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with a comprehending, genial, insolent smile, replied: \u201cWhy! That is not of the slightest importance,here!\u201d And he gave a little laugh that was all his own \u2014 a laugh that came to him probably from some Bavarian or Lorraine grandmother, who herself had inherited it, in identical form, from an ancestress, so that it had been sounding now, without change, for not a few centuries in little old-fashioned European courts, and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare. There are times when, to paint a complete portrait of some one, we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description, and our portrait of the figure that M. de Charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh, so delicate, so light, just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those \u2018small trumpets,\u2019 with a sound so entirely their own, for which the composer wrote this or that part. \u201cBut,\u201d M. Verdurin explained, stung by his laugh, \u201cwe did it on purpose. I attach no importance whatever to title of nobility,\u201d he went on, with that contemptuous smile which I have seen so many people whom I have known, unlike my grandmother and my mother, assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess, before others who thus, they supposed, would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you see, since we happened to have M. de Cambremer here, and he is a Marquis, while you are only a Baron. . . . \u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d M. de Charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished Verdurin, \u201cI am also Duc de Brabant, Damoiseau de Montargis, Prince d\u2019Oloron, de Carency, de Viareggio and des Dunes. However, it is not of the slightest importance. Please do not distress yourself,\u201d he concluded, resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words: \u201cI could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin came across to me to shew me Elstir\u2019s flowers. If this action, to which I had grown so indifferent, of going out to dinner, had on the contrary, taking the form that made it entirely novel, of a journey along the coast, followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea, produced in me a sort of intoxication, this feeling had not been dispelled at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cJust look at this, now,\u201d said the Mistress, shewing me some huge and splendid roses by Elstir, whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out, however, with almost too creamy a relief from the flower-stand upon which they were arranged. \u201cDo you suppose he would still have to touch to get that? Don\u2019t you call that striking? And besides, it\u2019s fine as matter, it would be amusing to handle. I can\u2019t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them. One could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect.\u201d And the Mistress\u2019s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her; behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her, she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them, in the course of a morning, in their freshness, so that, they on the table, it leaning against the back of a chair, had been able to meet face to face at the Mistress\u2019s luncheon party, the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait. Almost only, for Elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain. He had shewn in this water-colour the appearance of the roses which he had seen, and which, but for him, no one would ever have known; so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter, like a skilful gardener, had enriched the family of the Roses. \u201cFrom the day he left the little nucleus, he was finished. It seems, my dinners made him waste his time, that I hindered the development of his genius,\u201d she said in a tone of irony. \u201cAs if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist,\u201d she exclaimed with a burst of pride. Close beside us, M. de Cambremer, who was already seated, seeing that M. de Charlus was standing, made as though to rise and offer him his chair. This offer may have arisen, in the Marquis\u2019s mind, from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite. M. de Charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a Prince, and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it. And so he exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing? I beg of you! The idea!\u201d The astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically \u2018Guermantes\u2019 which became even more evident in the imperative, superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down, as though to force him to remain seated, upon the shoulders of M. de Cambremer who had not risen. \u201cCome, come, my dear fellow,\u201d the Baron insisted, \u201cthis is too much. There is no reason for it! In these days we keep that for Princes of the Blood.\u201d I made no more effect on the Cambremers than on Mme. Verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house. For I remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences; at times I even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine. I enraged Mme. de Cambremer by telling her that I had supposed the place to be more in the country. On the other hand I broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door. \u201cI see you like draughts,\u201d they said to me. My praise of the patch of green lining-cloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success: \u201cHow frightful!\u201d cried the Marquise. The climax came when I said: \u201cMy greatest joy was when I arrived. When I heard my step echoing along the gallery, I felt that I had come into some village council-office, with a map of the district on the wall.\u201d This time, Mme. de Cambremer resolutely turned her back on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the arrangement too bad?\u201d her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony. \u201cThey have some fine things.\u201d But, inasmuch as malice, when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits, finds fault with everything, in the persons or in the houses, of the people who have supplanted the critic: \u201cYes, but they are not in the right places. Besides, are they really as fine as all that?\u201d \u201cYou noticed,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness, \u201cthere are some Jouy hangings that are worn away, some quite threadbare things in this drawing-room!\u201d \u201cAnd that piece of stuff with its huge roses, like a peasant woman\u2019s quilt,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy, impressionist painting and Debussy\u2019s music. And, so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste: \u201cAnd they have put up windscreens! Such bad style! What can you expect of such people, they don\u2019t know, where could they have learned? They must be retired tradespeople. It\u2019s really not bad for them.\u201d \u201cI thought the chandeliers good,\u201d said the Marquis, though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers, just as inevitably, whenever anyone spoke of a church, whether it was the Cathedral of Chartres, or of Rheims, or of Amiens, or the church at Balbec, what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be: \u201cthe organ-loft, the pulpit and the misericords.\u201d \u201cAs for the garden, don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cIt\u2019s a massacre. Those paths running all crooked.\u201d I seized the opportunity while Mme. Verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which M. de Cambremer had brought me, and in which his mother invited me to dinner. With that faint trace of ink, the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future I should be able to recognise among a thousand, without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens, than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision. Indeed a paralytic, stricken with agraphia after a seizure, and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it, would have gathered that Mme. de Cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions. He would have guessed also the period in which the Marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play Chopin\u2019s music. It was the time when well-bred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives. Mme. de Cambremer combined the two rules in one. A laudatory adjective was not enough for her, she followed it (after a little stroke of the pen) with a second, then (after another stroke), with a third. But, what was peculiar to herself was that, in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed, the sequence of the three epithets assumed in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo. Mme. de Cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen Saint-Loup and had appreciated more than ever his \u2018unique \u2014 rare \u2014 real\u2019 qualities, that he was coming to them again with one of his friends (the one who was in love with her daughter-in-law), and that if I cared to come, with or without them, to dine at F\u00e9terne she would be \u2018delighted \u2014 happy \u2014 pleased.\u2019 Perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady, while determined to utter three exclamations, was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first. Add but a fourth adjective, and, of her initial friendliness, there would be nothing left. Moreover, with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance, Mme. de Cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word (which might in time begin to ring false) \u2018sincere,\u2019 the word \u2018true.\u2019 And to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled, she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective \u2018true\u2019 before its noun, and planted it boldly after. Her letters ended with: \u201cCroyez \u00e0 mon amiti\u00e9 vraie.\u201d \u201cCroyez \u00e0 ma sympathie vraie.\u201d Unfortunately, this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the time-honoured formulas, of the meaning of which people have ceased to think. I was, however, hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of M. de Charlus, who, still on the same topic, was saying to M. de Cambremer: \u201cYou reminded me, when you offered me your chair, of a gentleman from whom I received a letter this morning, addressed: \u2018To His Highness, the Baron de Charlus,\u2019 and beginning \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be sure, your correspondent was slightly exaggerating,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer, giving way to a discreet show of mirth. M. de Charlus had provoked this; he did not partake in it. \u201cWell, if it comes to that, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI may observe that, heraldically speaking, he was entirely in the right. I am not regarding it as a personal matter, you understand. I should say the same of anyone else. But one has to face the facts, history is history, we can\u2019t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it. I need not cite the case of the Emperor William, who at Kiel never ceased to address me as \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 I have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the Dukes of France, which was an abuse of the privilege, but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at France herself.\u201d \u201cMore delicate, perhaps, than sincere,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cAh! There I must differ from you. Observe that, personally, a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that Hohenzollern, a Protestant to boot, and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the King of Hanover, can be no favourite of mine,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with whom the annexation of Hanover seemed to rankle more than that of Alsace-Lorraine. \u201cBut I believe the feeling that turns the Emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere. Fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor. He is on the contrary marvellously intelligent; it is true that he knows nothing about painting, and has forced Herr Tschudi to withdraw the Elstirs from the public galleries. But Louis XIV did not appreciate the Dutch Masters, he had the same fondness for display, and yet he was, when all is said, a great Monarch. Besides, William II has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that Louis XIV failed to do, and I hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the Roi Soleil. The Republic made a great mistake, to my mind, in rejecting the overtures of the Hohenzollern, or responding to them only in driblets. He is very well aware of it himself and says, with that gift that he has for the right expression: \u2018What I want is a clasped hand, not a raised hat.\u2019 As a man, he is vile; he has abandoned, surrendered, denied his best friends, in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the Eulenburg affair, and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him: \u201cThe Emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial. But he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion. We would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed.\u201d \u201cAll that, however, has nothing to do with what I was trying to explain, which is that, in Germany, mediatised Princes like ourselves are Durchlaucht, and in France our rank of Highness was publicly recognised. Saint-Simon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part, in which he is entirely mistaken. The reason that he gives, namely that Louis XIV forbade us to style him the Most Christian King and ordered us to call him simply the King, proves merely that we held our title from him, and not that we had not the rank of Prince. Otherwise, it would have to be withheld from the Duc de Lorraine and ever so many others. Besides, several of our titles come from the House of Lorraine through Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Espinay, my great-grandmother, who was the daughter of the Damoiseau de Commercy.\u201d Observing that Morel was listening, M. de Charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim. \u201cI have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of Gotha, but in the second, not to say the first, that the account of our family ought to be included,\u201d he said, without stopping to think that Morel did not know what \u2018Gotha\u2019 was. \u201cBut that is his affair, he is the Head of my House, and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass, I have only to shut my eyes.\u201d \u201cM. Brichot interests me greatly,\u201d I said to Mme. Verdurin as she joined me, and I slipped Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s letter into my pocket. \u201cHe has a cultured mind and is an excellent man,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cOf course what he lacks is originality and taste, he has a terrible memory. They used to say of the \u2018forebears\u2019 of the people we have here this evening, the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, that they had forgotten nothing. But they had at least the excuse,\u201d she said, borrowing one of Swann\u2019s epigrams, \u201cthat they had learned nothing. Whereas Brichot knows everything, and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner. I\u2019m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages.\u201d While Mme. Verdurin was speaking, it occurred to me that I had determined to ask her something, but I could not remember what it was. I could not at this moment say what Mme. Verdurin was wearing that evening. Perhaps even then I was no more able to say, for I have not an observant mind. But feeling that her dress was not unambitious I said to her something polite and even admiring. She was like almost all women, who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth, and is a judgment impartially, irresistibly pronounced, as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person. And so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question, habitual in the circumstances: \u201cYou like it?\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re talking about Brichot. Eh, Chantepie, Freycinet, he spared you nothing. I had my eye on you, my little Mistress!\u201d \u201cI saw you, it was all I could do not to laugh.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about Chantepie, I am certain,\u201d said M. Verdurin, as he came towards us. I had been alone, as I thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood, in failing to notice that, while he discussed etymologies, Brichot had been provoking derision. And inasmuch as the expressions which, for me, gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them, as unimportant, they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of Mme. Verdurin who saw that I had \u2018swallowed\u2019 Brichot, as before I had appeared stupid to Mme. de Guermantes, because I enjoyed going to see Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. With Brichot, however, there was another reason. I was not one of the little clan. And in every clan, whether it be social, political, literary, one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation, in an official speech, in a story, in a sonnet, everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there. How many times have I found myself, after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly old-fashioned Academician, on the point of saying to Bloch or to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cHow charming this is!\u201d when before I had opened my mouth they exclaimed, each in a different language: \u201cIf you want to be really amused, read a tale by So-and-so. Human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths.\u201d Bloch\u2019s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style, pleasant enough in themselves, were slightly faded; that of Mme. de Guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant, for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me. I was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the Verdurins\u2019 apparent friendliness for Brichot than to hear, some days later, at F\u00e9terne, the Cambremers say to me, on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la Raspeli\u00e8re: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you can be sincere, after all they\u2019ve done to it.\u201d It is true that they admitted that the china was good. Like the shocking windscreens, it had escaped my notice. \u201cAnyhow, when you go back to Balbec, you will know what Balbec means,\u201d said M. Verdurin ironically. It was precisely the things Brichot had told me that interested me. As for what they called his mind, it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan. He talked with the same irritating fluency, but his words no longer carried, having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes; what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience. \u201cTake care,\u201d Mme. Verdurin murmured, pointing to Brichot. The latter, whose hearing remained keener than his vision, darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a short-sighted philosopher. If his bodily eyes were less good, his mind\u2019s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things. He saw how little was to be expected of human affection, and resigned himself to it. Undoubtedly the discovery pained him. It may happen that even the man who on one evening only, in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy, realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud, or too forward, or whatever it may be, returns home miserable. Often it is a difference of opinion, or of system, that has made him appear to other people absurd or old-fashioned. Often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself. He could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned, he is tempted to pay a call, to write a letter: on second thoughts, he does nothing, awaits the invitation for the following week. Sometimes, too, these discomfitures, instead of ending with the evening, last for months. Arising from the instability of social judgments, they increase that instability further. For the man who knows that Mme. X despises him, feeling that he is respected at Mme. Y\u2019s, pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house. This however is not the proper place to describe those men, superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it, glad to be invited, embittered by being disparaged, discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated, ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new, and when they have begun to forget those of the old. We may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that Brichot felt at one which he knew to be final. He was not unaware that Mme. Verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly, even at his infirmities, and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection, submitting himself to the facts, he continued nevertheless to regard the Mistress as his best friend. But, from the blush that swept over the scholar\u2019s face, Mme. Verdurin saw that he had heard her, and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening. I could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to Saniette. \u201cWhat! Not kind to him! Why, he adores us, you can\u2019t imagine what we are to him. My husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity, and you must admit that he has every reason, but when that happens why doesn\u2019t he rise in revolt, instead of cringing like a whipped dog? It is not honest. I don\u2019t like it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t always try to calm my husband, because if he went too far, all that would happen would be that Saniette would stay away; and I don\u2019t want that because I may tell you that he hasn\u2019t a penny in the world, he needs his dinners. But after all, if he does mind, he can stay away, it has nothing to do with me, when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot.\u201d \u201cThe Duchy of Aumale was in our family for years before passing to the House of France,\u201d M. de Charlus was explaining to M. de Cambremer, before a speechless Morel, for whom, as a matter of fact, the whole of this dissertation was, if not actually addressed to him, intended. \u201cWe took precedence over all foreign Princes; I could give you a hundred examples. The Princesse de Croy having attempted, at the burial of Monsieur, to fall on her knees after my great-great-grandmother, that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock, made the officer on duty remove it, and reported the matter to the King, who ordered Mme. de Croy to call upon Mme. de Guermantes and offer her apologies. The Duc de Bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands, we obtained the King\u2019s authority to have them lowered. I know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one\u2019s own family. But it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger. Our battle-cry, after we abandoned that of the Dukes of Brabant, was Passavant! So that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first, which we had established for so many centuries in war, should afterwards have been confirmed to us at Court. And, egad, it has always been admitted there. I may give you a further instance, that of the Princess of Baden. As she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same Duchesse de Guermantes of whom I was speaking just now, and had attempted to go in first to the King\u2019s presence, taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn (although there could be no reason for it), the King called out: \u2018Come in, cousin, come in; Mme. de Baden knows very well what her duty is to you.\u2019 And it was as Duchesse de Guermantes that she held this rank, albeit she was of no mean family herself, since she was through her mother niece to the Queen of Poland, the Queen of Hungary, the Elector Palatine, the Prince of Savoy-Carignano and the Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England.\u201d \u201cMaecenas atavis \u00e9dite regibus!\u201d said Brichot, addressing M. de Charlus, who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked Brichot, anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech. \u201cI was referring, Heaven forgive me, to a dandy who was the pick of the basket\u201d (Mme. Verdurin winced) \u201cabout the time of Augustus\u201d (Mme. Verdurin, reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket, assumed a more serene expression), \u201cof a friend of Virgil and Horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic, his royal descent, in a word I was referring to Maecenas, a bookworm who was the friend of Horace, Virgil, Augustus. I am sure that M. de Charlus knows all about Maecenas.\u201d With a gracious, sidelong glance at Mme. Verdurin, because he had heard her make an appointment with Morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also, \u201cI should say,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cthat Maecenas was more or less the Verdurin of antiquity.\u201d Mme. Verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction. She went over to Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, your father\u2019s friend,\u201d she said to him. \u201cOne can see that he\u2019s an educated man, and well bred. He will get on well in our little nucleus. What is his address in Paris?\u201d Morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards. Mme. Verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first. To the general astonishment, M. de Charlus, who never referred to his own considerable gifts, accompanied, in the purest style, the closing passage (uneasy, tormented, Schumannesque, but, for all that, earlier than Franck\u2019s Sonata) of the Sonata for piano and violin by Faur\u00e9. I felt that he would furnish Morel, marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity, with just those qualities that he lacked, culture and style. But I thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift. M. de Charlus was not very different from his brother, the Duc de Guermantes. Indeed, a moment ago (though this was rare), he had spoken as bad French as his brother. He having reproached me (doubtless in order that I might speak in glowing terms of Morel to Mme. Verdurin) with never coming to see him, and I having pleaded discretion, he had replied: \u201cBut, since it is I that asks you, there is no one but I who am in a position to take offence.\u201d This might have been said by the Duc de Guermantes. M. de Charlus was only a Guermantes when all was said. But it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the Duke would have chosen one of Virgil\u2019s shepherds or Plato\u2019s disciples, and at once qualities unknown to the Duc de Guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made M. de Charlus an exquisite pianist, an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste, an eloquent talker. Who would ever have detected that the rapid, eager, charming style with which M. de Charlus played the Schumannesque passage of Faur\u00e9\u2018s Sonata had its equivalent \u2014 one dares not say its cause \u2014 in elements entirely physical, in the nervous defects of M. de Charlus? We shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects, and why it is that a Greek of the time of Socrates, a Roman of the time of Augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men, and not men-women such as we see around us to-day. Just as he had genuine artistic tendencies, which had never come to fruition, so M. de Charlus had, far more than the Duke, loved their mother, loved his own wife, and indeed, years after her death, if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears, but superficial tears, like the perspiration of an over-stout man, whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion. With this difference, that to the latter we say: \u201cHow hot you are,\u201d whereas we pretend not to notice other people\u2019s tears. We, that is to say, people in society; for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage. His sorrow after the death of his wife, thanks to the habit of falsehood, did not debar M. de Charlus from a life which was not in harmony \u2022with it. Indeed later on, he sank so low as to let it be known that, during the funeral rites, he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address. And it may have been true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the piece eame to an end, I ventured to ask for some Franck, which appeared to cause Mme. de Cambremer such acute pain that I did not insist. \u201cYou can\u2019t admire that sort of thing,\u201d she said to me. Instead she asked for Debussy\u2019s F\u00eates, which made her exclaim: \u201cAh! How sublime!\u201d from the first note. But Morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only, and in a spirit of mischief, without any intention to deceive, began a March by Meyerbeer. Unfortunately, as he left little interval and made no announcement, everybody supposed that he was still playing Debussy, and continued to exclaim \u2018Sublime!\u2019 Morel, by revealing that the composer was that not of Pell\u00e9as but of Robert le Diable created a certain chill. Mme. de Cambremer had scarcely time to feel it, for she had just discovered a volume of Scarlatti, and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse. \u201cOh! Play this, look, this piece, it\u2019s divine,\u201d she cried. And yet, of this composer long despised, recently ^promoted to the highest honours, what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping, while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor. But Morel had had enough music, and as he insisted upon cards, M. de Charlus, to be able to join in, proposed a game of whist. \u201cHe was telling the Master just now that he is a Prince,\u201d said Ski to Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut it\u2019s not true, they\u2019re quite a humble family of architects.\u201d \u201cI want to know what it was you were saying about Maecenas. It interests me, don\u2019t you know!\u201d Mme. Verdurin repeated to Brichot, with an affability that carried him off his feet. And so, in order to shine in the Mistress\u2019s eyes, and possibly in mine: \u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Madame, Maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that Chinese god who numbers more followers in France to-day than Brahma, than Christ himself, the all-powerful God Ubedamd.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was no longer content, upon these occasions, with burying her head in her hands. She would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon Princess Sherbatoff; were the latter within reach the Mistress would cling to her shoulder, dig her nails into it, and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek. Concealed by this protecting screen, she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands. Mme. Verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to Beethoven quartets, so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep. \u201cI am quite serious, Madame,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cToo numerous, I consider, to-day is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe. As a matter of doctrine, I have no objection to offer to some Nirvana which will dissolve us in the great Whole (which, like Munich and Oxford, is considerably nearer to Paris than Asni\u00e8res or Bois-Colombes), but it is unworthy either of a true Frenchman, or of a true European even, when the Japanese are possibly at the gates of our Byzantium, that socialised anti-militarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse.\u201d Mme. Verdurin felt that she might dispense with the Princess\u2019s mangled shoulder, and allowed her face to become once more visible, not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath. But Brichot was determined that I should have my share in the entertainment, and having learned, from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably, that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them, to make them feel themselves important, to make them regard you as a reactionary: \u201cI have no wish to blaspheme against the Gods of Youth,\u201d he said, with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name. \u201cI have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the Mallarm\u00e9an chapel in which our new friend, like all the young men of his age, must have served the esoteric mass, at least as an acolyte, and have shewn himself deliquescent or Rosicrucian. But, really, we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big A, who, when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon Zola, inject themselves with Verlaine. Become etheromaniacs out of Baude-lairean devotion, they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may, one day or another, demand of them, anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated, enervating atmosphere, heavy with unwholesome vapours, of a symbolism of the opium-pipe.\u201d Feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for Brichot\u2019s inept and motley tirade, I turned to Ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged; he replied that he was certain of his facts, and added that I myself had said that his real name was Gandin, Le Gandin. \u201cI told you,\u201d was my answer, \u201cthat Mme. de Cambremer was the sister of an engineer, M. Legrandin. I never said a word to you about M. de Charlus. There is about as much connexion between him and Mme. de Cambremer as between the Great Cond\u00e9 and Racine.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I thought there was,\u201d said Ski lightly, with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train. \u201cDo you intend to remain long on this coast?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked M. de Charlus, in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to Paris. \u201cGood Lord, one never knows,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a nasal drawl. \u201cI should like to stay here until the end of September.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin; \u201cthat is the time for fine storms at sea.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, that is not what would influence me. I have for some time past unduly neglected the Archangel Saint Michael, my patron, and I should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast, on the 29th of September, at the Abbey on the Mount.\u201d \u201cYou take an interest in all that sort of thing?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anti-clericalism, had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the Baron \u2018fail\u2019 her for forty-eight hours. \u201cYou are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness,\u201d M. de Charlus replied insolently. \u201cI have told you that Saint Michael is one of my glorious patrons.\u201d Then, smiling with a benevolent ecstasy, his eyes gazing into the distance, his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious: \u201cIt is so beautiful at the offertory when Michael stands erect by the altar, in a white robe, swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to God.\u201d \u201cWe might go there in a party,\u201d suggested Mme. Verdurin, notwithstanding her horror of the clergy. \u201cAt that moment, when the offertory begins,\u201d went on M. de Charlus who, for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in Parliament, never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it, \u201cit would be wonderful to see our young friend Palestrinising, indeed performing an aria by Bach. The worthy Abbot, too, would be wild with joy, and that is the greatest homage, at least the greatest public homage that I can pay to my Holy Patron. What an edification for the faithful! We must mention it presently to the young Angelico of music, a warrior like Saint Michael.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette, summoned to make a fourth, declared that he did not know how to play whist. And Cottard, seeing that there was not much time left before our train, embarked at once on a game of \u00e9cart\u00e9 with Morel. M. Verdurin was furious, and bore down with a terrible expression upon Saniette. \u201cIs there anything in the world that you can play?\u201d he cried, furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist, and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar. He, in his terror, did his best to look clever. \u201cYes, I can play the piano,\u201d he said. Cottard and Morel were seated face to face. \u201cYour deal,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cSuppose we go nearer to the card-table,\u201d M. de Charlus, worried by the sight of Morel in Cottard\u2019s company, suggested to M. de Cambremer. \u201cIt is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much. The only kings that we have left, in France at least, are the kings in the pack of cards, who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso,\u201d he added a moment later, from an admiration for Morel which extended to his way of playing cards, to flatter him also, and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI-ee cut,\u201d said (imitating the accent of a cardsharper) Cottard, whose children burst out laughing, like his students and the chief dresser, whenever the master, even by the bedside of a serious case, uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d said Morel, seeking advice from M. de Charlus. \u201cJust as you please, you\u2019re bound to lose, whatever you play, it\u2019s all the same (c\u2019est \u00e9gal).\u201d \u201cEgal . . . Ingalli?\u201d said the doctor, with an insinuating, kindly glance at M. de Cambremer. \u201cShe was what we call a true diva, she was a dream, a Carmen such as we shall never see again. She was wedded to the part. I used to enjoy too listening to Ingalli \u2014 married.\u201d The Marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of well-bred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests, and adopt English manners by way of apology for a scornful expression: \u201cWho is that gentleman playing cards, what does he do for a living, what does he sell? I rather like to know whom I am meeting, so as not to make friends with any Tom, Dick or Harry. But I didn\u2019t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him.\u201d If M. Verdurin, availing himself of this phrase, had indeed introduced M. de Cambremer to his fellow-guests, the other would have been greatly annoyed. But, knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed, he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air, without risk to himself. The pride that M. Verdurin took in his intimacy with Cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor. But it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days. Then, when Cottard was scarcely known to the public, if you spoke to M. Verdurin of his wife\u2019s facial neuralgia: \u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d he would say, with the artless self-satisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous, and that everybody knows the name of their family singing-master. \u201cIf she had an ordinary doctor, one might look for a second opinion, but when that doctor is called Cottard\u201d (a name which he pronounced as though it were Bouchard or Charcot) \u201cone has simply to bow to the inevitable.\u201d Adopting a reverse procedure, knowing that M. de Cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous Professor Cottard, M. Verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s our family doctor, a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes; he is not a doctor, he is a friend, I don\u2019t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you, in any case to us it is the name of a very good man, of a very dear friend, Cottard.\u201d This name, murmured in a modest tone, took in M. de Cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else. \u201cCottard? You don\u2019t mean Professor Cottard?\u201d At that moment one heard the voice of the said Professor who, at an awkward point in the game, was saying as he looked at his cards: \u201cThis is where Greek meets Greek.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, to be sure, he is a professor,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cWhat! Professor Cottard! You are not making a mistake?-You are quite sure it\u2019s the same man? The one who lives in the Rue du Bac?\u201d \u201cYes, his address is 43, Rue du Bac. You know him?\u201d \u201cBut everybody knows Professor Cottard. He\u2019s at the top of the tree! You might as well ask me if I knew Bouffe de Saint-Biaise or Courtois-Suffit. I could see when I heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person, that is why I took the liberty of asking you.\u201d \u201cCome now, what shall I play, trumps?\u201d asked Cottard. Then abruptly, with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances, as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death, but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards, Cottard, deciding to play a trump, assumed a sombre, suicidal air, and, borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins, played his card as though it were his life, with the exclamation: \u201cThere it is, and be damned to it!\u201d It was not the right card to play, but he had a consolation. In the middle of the room, in a deep armchair, Mme. Cottard, yielding to the effect, which she always found irresistible, of a good dinner, had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her. In vain might she sit up now and again, and smile, whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her, she sank back, in spite of herself, into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady. More than the noise, what awakened her thus for an instant only, was the giance (which, in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut, and foresaw, for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise), the glance with which the Professor drew the attention of those present to his wife\u2019s slumbers. To begin with, he merely looked at her and smiled, for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner (or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on, but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason, so many and diverse were the views that he held about it), as an all-powerful and teasing husband, he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife, to rouse her only partly at first, so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Mme. Cottard was sound asleep. \u201cNow then, L\u00e9ontine you\u2019re snoring,\u201d the professor called to her. \u201cI am listening to Mme. Swann, my dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard replied faintly, and dropped back into her lethargy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect nonsense,\u201d exclaimed Cottard, \u201cshe\u2019ll be telling us presently that she wasn\u2019t asleep. She\u2019s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all.\u201d \u201cThey imagine it, perhaps,\u201d said M. de Cambremer with a laugh. But the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing, and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him. \u201cPeople do not imagine that they never sleep,\u201d he promulgated in a dogmatic tone. \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Marquis with a respectful bow, such as Cottard at one time would have made. \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d Cottard went on, \u201cthat you have never administered, as I have, as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking som-nolescence.\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d replied the Marquis, laughing with a superior air, \u201cI have never taken trional, or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach. When a man has been out shooting all night, like me, in the forest of Chantepie, I can assure you he doesn\u2019t need any trional to make him sleep.\u201d \u201cIt is only fools who say that,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cTrional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone. You mention trional, have you any idea what it is?\u201d \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep.\u201d \u201cYou are not answering my question,\u201d replied the Professor, who, thrice weekly, at the Faculty, sat on the board of examiners. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not, but what it is. Can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer with embarrassment. \u201cI prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 Port.\u201d \u201cWhich are ten times as toxic,\u201d the Professor interrupted. \u201cAs for trional,\u201d M. de Cambremer ventured, \u201cmy wife goes in for all that sort of thing, you\u2019d better talk to her about it.\u201d \u201cShe probably knows just as much about it as yourself. In any case, if your wife takes trional to make her sleep, you can see that mine has no need of it. Come along, L\u00e9ontine, wake up, you\u2019re getting ankylosed, did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner? What will you be like when you\u2019re sixty, if you fall asleep now like an old woman? You\u2019ll go and get fat, you\u2019re arresting the circulation. She doesn\u2019t even hear what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re bad for one\u2019s health, these little naps after dinner, ain\u2019t they, Doctor?\u201d said M. de Cambremer, seeking to rehabilitate himself with Cottard. \u201cAfter a heavy meal one ought to take exercise.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cWe have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced.\u201d \u201cThen it is sleep that stops digestion.\u201d \u201cThat depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion, stomachic digestion, intestinal digestion; it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine. Now then, L\u00e9ontine, quick march, it is time we were going.\u201d This was not true, for the doctor was going merely to continue his game, but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations. Whether a determination to remain awake survived in Mme. Cottard, even in the state of sleep, or because the armchair offered no support to her head, it was jerked mechanically from left to right, and up and down, in the empty air, like a lifeless object, and Mme. Cottard, with her nodding poll, appeared now to be listening to music, now to be in the last throes of death. Where her husband\u2019s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect, her sense of her own stupidity proved successful. \u201cMy bath is nice and hot,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut the feathers in the dictionary . . . \u201d she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright. \u201cOh! Good lord, what a fool I am. Whatever have I been saying, I was thinking about my hat, I\u2019m sure I said something silly, in another minute I should have been asleep, it\u2019s that wretched fire.\u201d Everybody began to laugh, for there was no fire in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume II ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, herself laughing, and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away, with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight, the last traces of sleep, \u201cI must offer my humble apologies to dear Mme. Verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth.\u201d But her smile at once grew sorrowful, for the Professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail, had shouted at her: \u201cLook at yourself in the glass, you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne, you look just like an old peasant.\u201d \u201cYou know, he is charming,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201che has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character. And then, he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole Faculty had given him up. He spent three nights by his bedside, without ever lying down. And so Cottard to me, you know,\u201d she went on, in a grave and almost menacing tone, raising her hand to the twin spheres, shrouded in white tresses, of her musical temples, and as though we had wished to assault the doctor, \u201cis sacred! He could ask me for anything in the world! As it is, I don\u2019t call him Doctor Cottard, I call him Doctor God! And even in saying that I am slandering him, for this God does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible.\u201d \u201cPlay a trump,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a delighted air. \u201cA trump, here goes,\u201d said the violinist. \u201cYou ought to have declared your king first,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cyou\u2019re not paying attention to the game, but how well you play!\u201d \u201cI have the king,\u201d said Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that business up there with the sticks?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, drawing M. de Cambremer\u2019s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece. \u201cAre they your arms?\u201d she added with an ironical disdain. \u201cNo, they are not ours,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cWe bear, barry of five, embattled counter-embattled or and gules, as many trefoils countercharged. No, those are the arms of the Arrachepels, who were not of our stock, but from whom we inherited the house, and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here. The Arrachepels (formerly Pelvilains, we are told) bore or five piles couped in base gules. When they allied themselves with the F\u00e9terne family, their blazon changed, but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or, a dexter canton ermine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one for her!\u201d muttered Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a d\u2019Arrachepel or de Rachepel, as you please, for both forms are found in the old charters,\u201d continued M. de Cambremer, blushing vividly, for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him, and he was afraid that Mme. Verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her. \u201cThe history books say that, in the eleventh century, the first Arrachepel, Mace, named Pelvilain, shewed a special aptitude, in siege warfare, in tearing up piles. Whence the name Arrachepel by which he was ennobled, and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms. These are the piles which, to render fortifications more impregnable, used to be driven, plugged, if you will pardon the expression, into the ground in front of them, and fastened together laterally. They are what you quite rightly called sticks, though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good Lafontaine. For they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable. Of course, with our modern artillery, they make one smile. But you must bear in mind that I am speaking of the eleventh century.\u201d \u201cIt is all rather out of date,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut the little campanile has a character.\u201d \u201cYou have,\u201d said Cottard, \u201cthe luck of . . . turlututu,\u201d a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using Moli\u00e8re\u2019s. \u201cDo you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind being in his shoes,\u201d said Morel, who was tired of military service. \u201cOh! What a bad patriot,\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who could not refrain from pinching the violinist\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army,\u201d Cottard pursued, determined to make his joke, \u201cit\u2019s because he has only one eye.\u201d \u201cYou are up against it, Doctor,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, to shew Cottard that he knew who he was. \u201cThis young man is astonishing,\u201d M. de Charlus interrupted innocently. \u201cHe plays like a god.\u201d This observation did not find favour with the doctor, who replied: \u201cNever too late to mend. Who laughs last, laughs longest.\u201d \u201cQueen, ace,\u201d Morel, whom fortune was favouring, announced triumphantly. The doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune, and admitted, spellbound: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cWe are so pleased to have met M. de Charlus,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cHad you never met him before? He is quite nice, he is unusual, he is of a period\u201c (she would have found it difficult to say which), replied Mme. Verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur, a judge and a hostess. Mme. de Cambremer asked me if I was coming to F\u00e9terne with Saint-Loup. I could not suppress a cry of admiration when I saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, presently, when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up, it will be a thousand times better.\u201d \u201cAre you staying any time in this neighbourhood, Madame?\u201d M. de Cambremer asked Mme. Cottard, a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement. \u201cOh, certainly, Sir, I regard this annual exodus as most important for the children. Whatever you may say, they must have fresh air. The Faculty wanted to send me to Vichy; but it is too stuffy there, and I can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger. Besides, the Professor, with all the examinations he has to hold, has always got his shoulder to the wheel, and the hot weather tires him dreadfully. I feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that. Whatever happens we shall stay another month at least.\u201d \u201cAh! In that case we shall meet again.\u201d \u201cBesides, I shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to Savoy, and won\u2019t be finally settled here for another fortnight.\u201d \u201cI like the view of the valley even more than the sea view,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on. \u201cYou are going to have a splendid night for your journey.\u201d \u201cWe ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready, if you are absolutely determined to go back to Balbec to-night,\u201d M. Verdurin said to me, \u201cfor I see no necessity for it myself. We could drive you over to-morrow morning. It is certain to be fine. The roads are excellent.\u201d I said that it was impossible. \u201cBut in any case it is not time yet,\u201d the Mistress protested. \u201cLeave them alone, they have heaps of time. A lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait. They are far happier here. And you, my young Mozart,\u201d she said to Morel, not venturing to address M. de Charlus directly, \u201cwon\u2019t you stay the night? We have some nice rooms facing the sea.\u201d \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d M. de Gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed card-player who had not heard. \u201cHe has a pass until midnight only. He must go back to bed like a good little boy, obedient, and well-behaved,\u201d he added in a complaisant, mannered, insistent voice, as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell, in passing, upon any reference to Morel, from touching him with (failing his fingers) words that seemed to explore his person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the sermon that Brichot had addressed to me, M. de Cambremer had concluded that I was a Dreyfusard. As he himself was as anti-Dreyfusard as possible, out of courtesy to a foe, he began to sing me the praises of a Jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the Chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved. \u201cAnd my cousin\u2019s opinions were the exact opposite,\u201d said M. de Cambremer; he omitted to mention what those opinions were, but I felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face, opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained. \u201cWell, you know, I call that really fine!\u201d was M. de Cambremer\u2019s conclusion. It is true that he was hardly employing the word \u2018fine\u2019 in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works, but works, anyhow, of art. M. de Cambremer often made use of this term, when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh. \u201cWhat, you have gained half-a-stone in two months. I say, that\u2019s fine!\u201d Refreshments were set out on a table. Mme. Verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred. M. de Charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the card-table from which he did not stir. Mme. Verdurin asked him: \u201cHave you tasted my orangeade?\u201d Upon which M. de Charlus, with a gracious smile, in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body, replied: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, it was strawberry-juice, I think, it was delicious.\u201d It is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them. If a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the Immaculate Conception, or in the innocence of Dreyfus, or in a plurality of worlds, and wishes to keep his opinion to himself, you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts. But on hearing M. de Charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d one could say: \u201cThere, he likes the stronger sex,\u201d with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed, a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years. Perhaps the people who conclude from a man\u2019s way of saying: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d a love of the kind called unnatural, have no need of any such scientific knowledge. But that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret. Without saying it in so many words to oneself, one feels that it is a gentle, smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms. And it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where, in exile, ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion, they know how to arrange a drawing-room, compose \u2018interiors.\u2019 M. de Charlus was not in the least perturbed that Mme. Verdurin should be standing, and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to Morel. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it criminal,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to the Baron, \u201cthat that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a card-table. When anyone can play the violin like that!\u201d \u201cHe plays cards well, he does everything well, he is so intelligent,\u201d said M. de Charlus, keeping his eye on the game, so as to be able to advise Morel. This was not his only reason, however, for not rising from his chair for Mme. Verdurin. With the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art, instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be, he would create a sort of tableau-vivant for himself after Saint-Simon; and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Uxelles, who interested him from other aspects also, and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated, with a pretence of laziness, before all the most distinguished persons at court. \u201cBy the way, Charlus,\u201d said Mme. Verdurip, who was beginning to grow familiar, \u201cyou don\u2019t know of any ruined old nobleman in your Faubourg who would come to me as porter?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes . . . why, yes,\u201d replied M. de Charlus with a genial smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t advise it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI should be afraid for your sake, that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther.\u201d This was the first skirmish between them. Mme. Verdurin barely noticed it. There were to be others, alas, in Paris. M. de Charlus remained glued to his chair. He could not, moreover, restrain a faint smile, seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middle-class cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of Mme. Verdurin. The Mistress appeared not at all surprised by the Baron\u2019s posture, and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by M. de Cambremer. But first of all, she wished to clear up the mystery of M. de Charlus\u2019s relations with Comtesse Mole. \u201cYou told me that you knew Mme. de Mol\u00ea. Does that mean, you go there?\u201d she asked, giving to the words \u2018go there\u2019 the sense of being received there, of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her. M. de Charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain, an affectation of precision and in a sing-song tone: \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d This \u2018sometimes\u2019 inspired doubts in Mme. Verdurin, who asked: \u201cHave you ever met the Duc de Guermantes there?\u201d \u201cAh! That I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the Duc de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cAnd how should I not know him?\u201d replied M. de Charlus, his lips curving in a smile. This smile was ironical; but as the Baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen, he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips, so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a good-natured smile. \u201cWhy do you say: \u2018How should I not know him?\u2019 \u201c \u201cBecause he is my brother,\u201d said M. de Charlus carelessly, leaving Mme. Verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her, was a natural son, or a son by another marriage. The idea that the brother of the Duc de Guermantes might be called Baron de Charlus never entered her head. She bore down upon me. \u201cI heard M. de Cambremer invite you to dinner just now. It has nothing to do with me, you understand. But for your own sake, I do hope you won\u2019t go. For one thing, the place is infested with bores. Oh! If you like dining with provincial Counts and Marquises whom nobody knows, you will be supplied to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d \u201cI think I shall be obliged to go there once or twice. I am not altogether free, however, for I have a young cousin whom I cannot leave by herself\u201d (I felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take Albertine about). \u201cBut as for the Cambremers, as I have been introduced to them. . . . \u201d \u201cYou shall do just as you please. One thing I can tell you: it\u2019s extremely unhealthy; when you have caught pneumonia, or a nice little chronic rheumatism, you\u2019ll be a lot better off!\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t the place itself very pretty?\u201d \u201cMmmmyess. . . . If you like. For my part, I confess frankly that I would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley. To begin with, if they\u2019d paid us I wouldn\u2019t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to M. Verdurin. If your cousin suffers at all from nerves. . . . But you yourself have bad nerves, I think you have choking fits. Very well! You shall see. Go there once, you won\u2019t sleep for a week after it; but it\u2019s not my business.\u201d And without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying: \u201cIf it would amuse you to see the house, which is not bad, pretty is too strong a word, still it is amusing with its old moat, and the old drawbridge, as I shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once, very well, come that day, I shall try to bring all my little circle, then it will be quite nice. The day after to-morrow we are going to Harambouville in the carriage. It\u2019s a magnificent drive, the cider is delicious. Come with us. You, Brichot, you shall come too. And you too, Ski. That will make a party which, as a matter of fact, my husband must have arranged already. I don\u2019t know whom all he has invited, Monsieur de Charlus, are you one of them?\u201d The Baron, who had not heard the whole speech, and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to Harambouville, gave a start. \u201cA strange question,\u201d he murmured in a mocking tone by which Mme. Verdurin felt hurt. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbefore you dine with the Cambremers, why not bring her here, your cousin? Does she like conversation, and clever people? Is she pleasant? Yes, very well then. Bring her with you. The Cambremers aren\u2019t the only people in the world. I can understand their being glad to invite her, they must find it difficult to get anyone. Here she will have plenty of fresh air, and lots of clever men. In any case, I am counting on you not to fail me next Wednesday. I heard you were having a tea-party at Rivebelle with your cousin, and M. de Charlus, and I forget who\u2019 else. You must arrange to bring the whole lot on here, it would be nice if you all came in a body. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to get here, the roads are charming; if you like I can send down for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you find attractive in Rivebelle, it\u2019s infested with mosquitoes. You are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rock-cakes. My cook makes them far better. I can let you have them, here, Norman rock-cakes, the real article, and shortbread; I need say no more. Ah! If you like the filth they give you at Rivebelle, that I won\u2019t give you, I don\u2019t poison my guests, Sir, and even if I wished to, my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service. Those rock-cakes you get down there, you can\u2019t tell what they are made of. I knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them, which carried her off in three days. She was only seventeen. It was sad for her poor mother,\u201d added Mme. Verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering. \u201cHowever, go and have tea at Rivebelle, if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window. But one thing I beg of you, it is a confidential mission I am charging you with, on the stroke of six, bring all your party here, don\u2019t allow them to go straggling away by themselves. You can bring whom you please. I wouldn\u2019t say that to everybody. But I am sure that your friends are nice, I can see at once that we understand one another. Apart from the little nucleus, there are some very pleasant people coming on Wednesday. You don\u2019t know little Madame de Longpont. She is charming, and so witty, not in the least a snob, you will find, you\u2019ll like her immensely. And she\u2019s going to bring a whole troop of friends too,\u201d Mme. Verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other\u2019s example. \u201cWe shall see which has most influence and brings most people, Barbe de Longpont or you. And then I believe somebody\u2019s going to bring Bergotte,\u201d she added with a vague air, this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning, to the effect that the great writer\u2019s health was causing grave anxiety. \u201cAnyhow, you will see that it will be one of my most successful Wednesdays, I don\u2019t want to have any boring women. You mustn\u2019t judge by this evening, it has been a complete failure. Don\u2019t try to be polite, you can\u2019t have been more bored than I was, I thought myself it was deadly. It won\u2019t always be like to-night, you know! I\u2019m not thinking of the Cambremers, who are impossible, but I have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant, well, compared with my little nucleus, they didn\u2019t exist. I heard you say that you thought Swann clever. I must say, to my mind, his cleverness was greatly exaggerated, but without speaking of the character of the man, which I have always found fundamentally antipathetic, sly, underhand, I have often had him to dinner on Wednesdays. Well, you can ask the others, even compared with Brichot, who is far from being anything wonderful, a good assistant master, whom I got into the Institute, Swann was simply nowhere. He was so dull!\u201d And, as I expressed a contrary opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to say a word against him to you, since he was your friend, indeed he was very fond of you, he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way, but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting, at our dinners. That, after all, is the supreme test. Well, I don\u2019t know why it was, but Swann, in my house, never seemed to come off, one got nothing out of him. And yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here.\u201d I assured her that he was highly intelligent. \u201cNo, you only think that, because you haven\u2019t known him as long as I have. One got to the end of him very soon. I was always bored to death by him.\u201d (Which may be interpreted: \u201cHe went to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and the Guermantes and knew that I didn\u2019t.\u201d) \u201cAnd I can put up with anything, except being bored. That, I cannot and will not stand!\u201d Her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which Mme. Verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group. She did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom, just as she was unable to go for a cruise, because of sea-sickness. I thought to myself that what Mme. Verdurin said was not entirely false, and, whereas the Guermantes would have declared Brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met, I remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior, if not to Swann himself, at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the Guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries; I asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that I should make, and with the earnestness of a Christian influenced by Port-Royal when he considers the problem of Grace. \u201cYou will see,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cwhen one has society people together with people of real intelligence, people of our set, that\u2019s where one has to see them, the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind, is only one-eyed here. Besides, the others don\u2019t feel at home any longer. So much so that I\u2019m inclined to ask myself whether, instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything, I shan\u2019t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus. However: you are coming again with your cousin. That\u2019s settled. Good. At any rate you will both find something to eat here. F\u00e9terne is starvation corner. Oh, by the way, if you like rats, go there at once, you will get as many as you want. And they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay. Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger. I\u2019m sure, when I go there, I shall have my dinner before I start. The more the merrier, you must come here first and escort me. We shall have high tea, and supper when we get back. Do you like apple-tarts? Yes, very well then, our chef makes the best in the world. You see, I was quite right when I told you that you were meant to live here. So come and stay. You know, there is far more room in the house than people think. I don\u2019t speak of it, so as not to let myself in for bores. You might bring your cousin to stay. She would get a change of air from Balbec. With this air here, I maintain I can cure incurables. I have cured them, I may tell you, and not only this time. For I have stayed quite close to here before, a place I discovered and got for a mere song, a very different style of house from their Raspelicre. I can shew you it if we go for a drive together. But I admit that even here the air is invigorating. Still, I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, the whole of Paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner. That has always been my luck. Anyhow, give your cousin my message. We shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley, you ought to see it in the morning, with the sun shining on the mist! By the way, who is this Robert de Saint-Loup of whom you were speaking?\u201d she said with a troubled air, for she had heard that I was to pay him a visit at Donci\u00e8res, and was afraid that he might make me fail her. \u201cWhy not bring him here instead, if he\u2019s not a bore. I have heard of him from Morel; I fancy he\u2019s one of his greatest friends,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin with entire want of truth, for Saint-Loup and Morel were not even aware of one another\u2019s existence. But having heard that Saint-Loup knew M. de Charlus, she supposed that it was through the violinist, and wished to appear to know all about them. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking up medicine, by any chance, or literature? You know, if you want any help about examinations, Cottard can do anything, and I make what use of him I please. As for the Academy later on, for I suppose he\u2019s not old enough yet, I have several notes in my pocket. Your friend would find himself on friendly soil here, and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house. Life\u2019s not very exciting at Donci\u00e8res. But you shall do just what you please, then you can arrange what you think best,\u201d she concluded, without insisting, so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth, and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful, to wit despotism, was named liberty. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you,\u201d she said, at the sight of M. Verdurin who, with gestures of impatience, was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawing-room above the valley, like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air. \u201cHas Saniette been annoying you again? But you know what an idiot he is, you have to resign yourself to him, don\u2019t work yourself up into such a state. I dislike this sort of thing,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbecause it is bad for him, it sends the blood to his head. But I must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with Saniette, and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house. For my part I must admit that he\u2019s so gloriously silly, I can\u2019t help enjoying him. I dare say you heard what he said after dinner: \u2018I can\u2019t play whist, but I can the piano.\u2019 Isn\u2019t it superb? It is positively colossal, and incidentally quite untrue, for he knows nothing at all about either. But my husband, beneath his rough exterior, is very sensitive, very kind-hearted, and Saniette\u2019s self-centred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy. Come, dear, calm yourself, you know Cottard told you that it was bad for your liver. And it is I that will have to bear the brunt of it all,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cTo-morrow Saniette will come back all nerves and tears. Poor man, he is very ill indeed. Still, that is no reason why he should kill other people. Besides, even at times when he is in pain, when one would like to be sorry for him, his silliness hardens one\u2019s heart. He is really too stupid. You have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill, and he is not to come again, since that\u2019s what he\u2019s most afraid of, it will have a soothing effect on his nerves,\u201d Mme. Verdurin whispered to her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right. But those on the other side shewed the valley, now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight. Now and again one heard the voices of Morel and Cottard. \u201cYou have a trump?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAh! You\u2019re in luck, you are,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Morel, in answer to his question, for he had seen that the doctor\u2019s hand was full of trumps. \u201cHere comes the lady of diamonds,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s a trump, you know? My trick. But there isn\u2019t a Sorbonne any longer,\u201d said the doctor to M. de Cambremer; \u201cthere\u2019s only the University of Paris.\u201d M. de Cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him. \u201cI thought you were talking about the Sorbonne,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cI heard you say: tu nous la sors bonne,\u201d he added, with a wink, to shew that this was meant for a pun. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d he said, pointing to his adversary, \u201cI have a Trafalgar in store for him.\u201d And the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor, for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter, which in his family, in the \u2018breed\u2019 of the Cottards, was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction. In the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement. Cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously, but one fine day, nobody ever knew by whose intervention, wifely, professorial perhaps, the rubbing of the hands had disappeared. The doctor even at dominoes, when he got his adversary on the run, and made him take the double six, which was to him the keenest of pleasures, contented himself with shaking his shoulders. And when \u2014 which was as seldom as possible \u2014 he went down to his native village for a few days, and met his first cousin, who was still at the hand-rubbing stage, he would say to Mme. Cottard on his return: \u201cI thought poor Ren\u00e9 very common.\u201d \u201cHave you the little dee-ar?\u201d he said, turning to Morel. \u201cNo? Then I play this old David.\u201d \u201cThen you have five, you have won!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great victory, Doctor,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cA Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Cottard, turning to face the Marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark. \u201cIf there is still time,\u201d he said to Morel, \u201cI give you your revenge. It is my deal. Ah! no, here come the carriages, it will have to be Friday, and I shall shew you a trick you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d M. and Mme. Verdurin accompanied us to the door. The Mistress was especially coaxing with Saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up, my boy,\u201d said M. Verdurin, whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone. \u201cOne would say the weather had changed.\u201d These words filled me with joy, as though the profoundly hidden life, the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature, hinted at other changes, these occurring in my own life, and created fresh possibilities in it. Merely by opening the door upon the park, before leaving, one felt that a different \u2018weather\u2019 had, at that mo-merit, taken possession of the scene; cooling breezes, one of the joys of summer, were rising in the fir plantation (where long ago Mme. de Cambremer had dreamed of Chopin) and almost imperceptibly, in caressing coils, capricious eddies, were beginning their gentle nocturnes. I declined the rug which, on subsequent evenings, I was to accept when Albertine was with me, more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold. A vain search was made for the Norwegian philosopher. Had he been seized by a colic? Had he been afraid of missing the train? Had an aeroplane come to fetch him? Had he been carried aloft in an Assumption? In any case he had vanished without anyone\u2019s noticing his departure, like a god. \u201cYou are unwise,\u201d M. de Cambremer said to me, \u201cit\u2019s as cold as charity.\u201d \u201cWhy charity?\u201d the doctor inquired. \u201cBeware of choking,\u201d the Marquis went on. \u201cMy sister never goes out at night. However, she is in a pretty bad state at present. In any case you oughtn\u2019t to stand about bare-headed, put your tile on at once.\u201d \u201cThey are not frigorifie chokings,\u201d said Cottard sententiously. \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d M. de Cambremer bowed. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your opinion. . . . \u201d \u201cOpinions of the press!\u201d said the doctor, smiling round his glasses. M. de Cambremer laughed, but, feeling certain that he was in the right, insisted: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said, \u201cwhenever my sister goes out after dark, she has an attack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use quibbling,\u201d replied the doctor, regardless of his want of manners. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t practise medicine by the seaside, unless I am called in for a consultation. I am here on holiday.\u201d He was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked. M. de Cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together: \u201cWe are fortunate in having quite close to us (not on your side of the Day, on the opposite side, but it is quite narrow at that point) another medical celebrity, Doctor du Boulbon,\u201d Cottard, who, as a rule, from \u2018deontology,\u2019 abstained from criticising his colleagues, could not help exclaiming, as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino: \u201cBut he is not a doctor. He practises \u2018a literary medicine, it is all fantastic therapeutics, charlatanism. All the same, we are on quite good terms. I should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit, if I weren\u2019t leaving.\u201d But, from the air which Cottard assumed in speaking of du Boulbon to M. de Cambremer, I felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which, in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor, Virgil (who took all their patients from them as well), the doctors of Salerno had chartered, but which sank with them on the voyage. \u201cGood-bye, my dear Saniette, don\u2019t forget to come to-morrow, you know how my husband enjoys seeing you. He enjoys your wit, your intellect; yes indeed, you know quite well, he takes sudden moods, but he can\u2019t live without seeing you. It\u2019s always the first thing he asks me: \u2018Is Saniette coming? I do so enjoy seeing him.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d said M. Verdurin to Saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the Mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated Saniette. Then looking at his watch, doubtless so as not to prolong the leave-taking in the damp night air, he warned the coachmen not to lose any time, but to be careful when going down the hill, and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train. This was to set down the faithful, one at one station, another at another, ending with myself, for no one else was going as far as Balbec, and beginning with the Cambremers. They, so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la Raspeli\u00e8re at night, took the train with us at Douville-F\u00e9terne. The station nearest to them was indeed not this, which, being already at some distance from the village, was farther still from the mansion, but la Sogne. On arriving at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, M. de Cambremer made a point of giving a \u2018piece,\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to say, to the Verdurins\u2019 coachman (the nice, sensitive coachman, with melancholy thoughts), for M. de Cambremer was generous, and in that respect took, rather, \u2018after his mamma.\u2019 But, possibly because his \u2018papa\u2019s\u2019 strain intervened at this point, he felt a scruple, or else that there might be a mistake \u2014 either on his part, if, for instance, in the dark, he were to give a you instead of a franc, or on the recipient\u2019s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him. And so he drew attention to it: \u201cIt is a franc I\u2019m giving you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to the coachman, turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight, and so that the faithful might report his action to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Twenty sous is right, as it\u2019s only a short drive.\u201d He and Mme. de Cambremer left us at la Sogne. \u201cI shall tell my sister,\u201d he repeated to me, \u201cthat you have choking fits, I am sure she will be interested.\u201d I understood that he meant: \u2018will be pleased.\u2019 As for his wife, she employed, in saying good-bye to me, two abbreviations which, even in writing, used to shock me at that time in a letter, although one has grown accustomed to them since, but which, when spoken, seem to me to-day even to contain in their deliberate carelessness, in their acquired familiarity, something insufferably pedantic: \u201cPleased to have met you,\u201d she said to me; \u201cgreetings to Saint-Loup, if you see him.\u201d In making this speech, Mme. de Cambremer pronounced the name \u2018Saint-Loupe.\u2019 I have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing, or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced. However it may be, for some weeks afterwards, she continued to say \u2018Saint-Loupe\u2019 and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same. If other people said \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 they would insist, would say emphatically \u2018Saint-Loupe,\u2019 whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them. But, no doubt, women of greater brilliance than Mme. de Cambremer told her, or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation, and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society, for shortly afterwards Mme. de Cambremer was again saying \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out, whether because she had lectured him, or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant, and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction, energy and ambition had yielded, it must have been on good grounds. The worst of her admirers was her husband. Mme. de Cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent. As soon as she began to attack me, or anyone else, in this fashion, M. de Cambremer would start watching her victim, laughing the while. As the Marquis had a squint \u2014 a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles \u2014 the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye. So a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky. His monocle moreover protected, like the glass over a valuable picture, this delicate operation. As for the actual intention of his laughter, it was hard to say whether it was friendly: \u201cAh! You rascal! You\u2019re in an enviable position, aren\u2019t you. You have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit!\u201d Or coarse: \u201cWell, Sir, I hope you\u2019ll learn your lesson, you\u2019ve got to eat a slice of humble pie.\u201d Or obliging: \u201cI\u2019m here, you know, I take it with a laugh because it\u2019s all pure fun, but I shan\u2019t let you be ill-treated.\u201d Or cruelly accessory: \u201cI don\u2019t need to add my little pinch of salt, but you can see, I\u2019m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you. I\u2019m wriggling like a hunchback, therefore I approve, I, the husband. And so, if you should take it into your head to answer back, you would have me to deal with, my young Sir. I should first of all give you a pair of resounding smacks, well aimed, then we should go and cross swords in the forest of Chantepie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the correct interpretation of the husband\u2019s merriment, the wife\u2019s whimsies soon came to an end. Whereupon M. de Cambremer ceased to laugh, the temporary pupil vanished and as one had forgotten for a minute or two to expect an entirely white eyeball, it gave this ruddy Norman an air at once anaemic and ecstatic, as though the Marquis had just undergone an operation, or were imploring heaven, through his monocle, for the palms of martyrdom", "http://genius.com/Marcel-proust-chapter-2-lyrics"], "399277": ["Too Young To Fall In Love by\u00a0M\u00f6tley\u00a0Cr\u00fce", "Too Young To Fall In Love Lyrics\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou say our love\nIs like dynamite\nOpen your eyes\nBecause it's like fire and ice\nWell you're killing me\nYour love's a guillotine\nWhy don't you just set me free\n\n[Chorus]\nToo young to fall in love\nI'm too young\nToo young to fall in love\nI'm too young\nToo young to fall in love\nI'm too young\nToo young to fall in love\nMuch too young\nToo young to fall in love\nI'm too young, too young\nTo fall in love\n\n[Verse 2]\nRun for the hills\nWe're both sinners and saints\nNot a woman, but a whore\nI can just taste the hate\nWell now I'm killing you\nWatch your face turning blue\nNot yet a man\nJust a punk in the street\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou say our love\nIs like dynamite\nWell its no surprise\nCause you've got one-way eyes\nWell you're killing me\nYour love's a guillotine\nNot yet a man\nJust a punk in the street\n\n[Chorus]", "http://genius.com/Motley-crue-too-young-to-fall-in-love-lyrics"], "1023278": ["Go West Young Man by\u00a0Michael\u00a0W.

He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diy\u00e1r Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sud\u00e1n, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayh\u00fan and Jayh\u00fan,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself.

Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, \"Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!\" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, \"Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:\" so quoth he to himself, \"If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:\" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of C\u00e6sarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, \"O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing\"[FN#146]\u2014a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, \"Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb.\" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Mak\u00e1n and his sister Nuzhat al-Zam\u00e1n.[FN#149] They answered \"Hearing and obedience,\" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest.\" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, \"O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afr\u00edd\u00fan,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,\u2014whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance.\" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, \"O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money.\" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, \"Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle.\" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, \"Ye have delay of three days.\" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, \"I hear and I obey;\" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, \"Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!\" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,\n\n\"Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    course through plain and wood:\nNo work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    gifts, Giver of all good!\"\n\nAnd as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,\n\n\"The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    debonnair:\nDouble its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   fair:\nVirgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ensnare;\nAnd like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    their hair:\nShooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  compare;\nOverpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.\"\n\nSharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,\n\n\"She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    straight slender stature enshamed the lance:\nShe burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    beauties have habitance:\nAnd the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.\"\n\nThen Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, \"Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!\" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, \"O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!\" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, \"O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?\"; and she answered, \"Yea,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, \"By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?\", and she answered, \"Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed\" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, \"Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do.\" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!\"[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, \"Do thou as I have done.\" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, \"He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others.\" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, \"O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!\" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, \"Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me.\" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, \"Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!\" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, \"Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so.\" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, \"I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?\" Quoth he, \"The wise man is he who taketh warning by others.\" Thereupon quoth she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee.\" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, \"Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions\"); \"Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!\" Rejoined the damsel, \"I am content herewith!\" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, \"And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!\" Then said she, \"Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam.\" Sharrkan replied, \"By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!\" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, \"Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!\"[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, \"Cross the stream to me;\" but she replied, \"It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me.\" \"I cannot do that,\" quoth he, and quoth she, \"O boy, I will come across to thee.\" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, \"O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,\" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, \"O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?\"; and he answered, \"O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!\" \"As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,\" she replied, \"it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous.\" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, \"Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?\" \"'Twas not for lack of strength in me,\" he answered; \"nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy.\" She laughed and said, \"I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long.\" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, \"Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you.\" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, \"Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), \"had I been Master al-Safd\u00ed, Master Mohammed Kim\u00e1l or Ibn al-Sadd\u00ed,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind.\" When she heard his words she said to him, \"Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round.\" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, \"O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way.\" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, \"Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!\" adding, \"Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us.\" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, \"Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?\" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), \"O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?\" So she turned to him laughing and said, \"What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer.\" \"Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,\" replied he, \"and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!\" \"None baulk kindliness save the base,\" she rejoined, \"honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest.\" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, \"Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent.\" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, \"O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours.\" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, \"O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am.\" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!\" \"Knowest thou Sharrkan?\" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople.\" \"O my lady,\" said Sharrkan, \"I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies.\" \"Now by the virtue of thy faith,\" she replied, \"did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), \"Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,\" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,\n\n\"An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.\"\n\nSo she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -\n\n\"For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pleading must bow:\nWhen I saw it I cried, \"To night * The moon at its fullest doth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    show;\nTho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would deal him a throw.\"\n\nThe two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, \"Ascend, O my lord, this throne.\" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, \"She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered.\" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,\n\n\"I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    what shall be my rede?\nWould any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleight would I be free'd:\nBut ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  can I trust my need!\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, \"Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!\" and broke out into these couplets,\n\n\"With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that sways with swimming gait\nShe deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   hide its ban and bate\nWhile hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    now necklaced and now separate.\"\n\nShe gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, \"In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?\"; adding, \"Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait.\" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, \"I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!\" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me.\" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, \"Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat.\" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, \"By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now.\" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, \"O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!\" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, \"O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!\" \"To hear is to obey,\" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,\n\n\"Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.\nI love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   rue the love in wrong head born and bred:\nHaply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the hapless heart by force of thee misled!\nThou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  life the deemster who would doom me dead.\"\n\nThereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, \"O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?\"; and he answered, \"Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips.\" She laughed and continued, \"If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?\" \"I should no longer,\" quoth he, \"be master of my senses.\" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,\n\n\"The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    alo\u00eb?\nI'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     cruelty!\nMy freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bitterly.\"\n\nWhen she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, \"She is gone to her sleeping chamber,\" whereto he rejoined, \"Under Allah's ward and His good guard!\" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, \"My mistress biddeth thee to her.\" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, \"Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?\"; and he answered \"Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter.\" \"Let me hear it,\" quoth she, so he began quoting,\n\n\"Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   freest with our name and fame!\nBy Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   less the more I claim:\nI dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that dearest dame;\nLike wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    siesta done, thin air became.\"\n\nWhen she heard this she said, \"Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang\" (and she began to recite),\n\n\"Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     beauty's bestest boon;\nAnd girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   cheeks her sandal-shoon!\n\nAnd indeed,\" quoth she, \"'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness.\" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, \"O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;\" and he answered, \"Yes, I know them better than any;\" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Jamil, in Holy war go fight!\" to me they say: * What war save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?\nTo me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:\nAn ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'\nAnd when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!\nThou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'\"\n\n\"Thou hast spoken right well,\" said she, \"O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,\n\n'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'\"\n\n\"O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan, \"she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee.\" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, \"Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!\" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,\n\n\"He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.\nPure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     roses with rubies vie:\nMeseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.\"\nWhen the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,\ntaking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, \"O son of King\nOmar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"but do not thou with me as said the poet,\n'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:\nI brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me:\n'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:\nAnd if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'\"\n\nThen she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, \"If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game.\" \"This is only our first,\" replied he, \"judge not by this bout.\" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, \"Thou art beaten in everything;\" and he replied, \"O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?\" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,\n\n\"Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     showeth.\nThen drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     forth goeth.\"\n\nThey ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,\n\n\"Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart\nE'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.\"\n\nWhile they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue \"Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!\" When he heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait.\" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, \"Who are ye?\" \"O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,\" answered the leading Knight, \"dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?\" \"Not I,\" she replied, \"who may he be?\" Quoth the Patrician, \"This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion.\" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, \"What be thy name?\" and he answered, \"I am M\u00e1s\u00farah, son of thy slave Maus\u00farah bin K\u00e1shardah, Knight of Knights.\" \"And how?\" quoth she, \"durst thou enter my presence without leave?\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them.\" \"These words be ill words,\" rejoined the Princess, \"and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi.\" \"O Abr\u00edzah,\" replied Masurah, the Knight, \"I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy.\" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). \"Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!\" Quoth Masurah, \"I will not return without him.\" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, \"Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand.\" \"Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,\" answered Masurah the Knight, \"I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort.\" When she heard this, she said, \"The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fiftieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, \"This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant.\" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first.\" Quoth she, \"Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom.\" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, \"How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?\" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, \"Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?\" \"That would be villainy,\" said she; \"Let one have at one.\" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, \"Take wreak for your chief!\" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, \"O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!\" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, \"Who is left in the convent?\"; and they replied, \"None but the gate keepers;\" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks.\" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, \"Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee.\" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,\n\n\"How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     bravest to lions a prey:\nAsk of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     days of the foray and fray:\nWhen I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, \"O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?\" \"To guard thee against these caitiffs,\"[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, \"How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?\"; and they answered, \"O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights.\" Quoth she, \"I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;\" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, \"Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!\" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, \"Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee.\" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, \"By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?\" \"Even so,\" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, \"Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee.\" \"What is it?\" asked he and she answered, \"It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country.\" Quoth he, \"O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune.\" Quoth she, \"Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:\u2014'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do.\" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, \"Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure.\" \"Go now to thine army,\" she replied, \"and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together.\" As he turned to depart she said, \"Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,\" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,\n\n\"I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     left hand held her in a close embrace:\n'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'\"\n\nThen Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] \"Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners.\" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry \"March! March!\" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called \"To horse!\" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, \"By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives.\" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?\" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, \"Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!\" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, \"By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!\" \"Know, O King,\" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all.\" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, \"When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens.\" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, \"Verily this day we did not win our will of these;\" and he replied, \"At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one.\" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, \"Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load.\" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, \"Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours.\" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, \"Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!\" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, \"What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him.\" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech \"Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway.\" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, \"Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men.\" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, \"Tomorrow shall decide the matter!\" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, \"O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.\"[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, \"What moved thee to a deed like this?\"; and she answered, \"I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat.\" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, \"Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!\" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, \"It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour.\" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, \"She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,\" he said to his father, \"the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,\" he continued, \"we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she.\" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, \"The King calleth for thee;\" she replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, \"Here be they with me, O King of the age!\" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, \"O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman.\" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, \"O King, hast thou a son other than myself?\" He answered, \"Yes, and he is now six years old;\" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, \"The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!\", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, \"How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes\" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine.\" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, \"He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?\" Quoth she, \"Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it.\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, \"Fear nothing,\" and talked with him awhile and continued, \"I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil.\" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, \"O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea.\" \" 'Tis well,\" rejoined she; \"if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you.\" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, \"Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?\" \"O King,\" answered Sophia, \"and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter.\" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, \"O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present.\" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, \"As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.\"[FN#218] \"Thy rede is aright,\" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, \"To thy companionship!\"; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marj\u00e1nah, and said, \"Go in to thy lady and speak with her.\" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, \"Tell me what hath befallen me.\" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, \"Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me.\" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, \"Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,\n\n'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'\"\n\nMarjanah answered her, \"It is thine to command; I will obey;\" and Abrizah said, \"I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will.\" \"O Princess,\" Marjanah replied, \"what thou wouldest do is well.\" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, \"I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead.\" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, \"Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" replied Marjanah, \"I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazb\u00e1n,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land.\" She rejoined, \"Call him that I may talk with him;\" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!\" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. \"How ever,\" she said to herself, \"of a truth, Need giveth the law;\" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, \"O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?\" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; \"O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires\" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee.\" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, \"O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses.\" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, \"I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches.\" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, \"Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;\" and cried to Marjanah, \"Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me.\" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said \"O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours.\" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\" And she was wroth with him and cried, \"Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this.\" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]\n\n\"O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of time, mischance and misery!\nWhoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'\nAnd if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,\nUpon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  all, however far or near they be;\nAnd with Yam\u00e1ni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sight my face who makes for villeiny,\nThe face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?\"\n\nWhen Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yam\u00e1ni[FN#225] glance the victim lie\nMy heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  patience done to die:\nFrom glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;\nThough at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!\"\n\nWhen Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, \"Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?\" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, \"Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!\" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, \"Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, \"Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!\" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, \"None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;\" and she continued to her son, \"Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire.\" \"By the virtue of the Messiah,\" replied he, \"I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say.\" Then quoth she, \"Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person.\" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-third Night.\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, \"How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!\" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, \"Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?\" \"O my father,\" replied Sharrkan, \"every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'\" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, \"O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time.\" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, \"O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony.\" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Ir\u00e1k passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, \"I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage.\" But his father forbade him saying, \"Wait till next year and I will go and thou too.\" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, \"I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" exclaimed she, \"take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!\" And he answered, \"As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any.\" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Araf\u00e1t and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, \"O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!).\" \"I also desire so to do,\" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!\" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, \"Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!\" Presently her brother said to her, \"O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat.\" \"By Allah! O my brother,\" replied she, \"I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living.\" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, \"Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!\" He rejoined, \"Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!\" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, \"O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land.\" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, \"I wish thee to bear me to the bazar.\" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, \"Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health.\" \"On my head be it!\" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, \"How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?\" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, \"Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?\" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, \"Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!\" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick.\" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, \"O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!\" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, \"What is now thy state, O my son?\" \"Praise be to Allah,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time.\" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, \"Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day.\" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, \"Eat, O my son!\" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, \"How is it with thee now, O my son?\" \"Thanks be to Allah for recovery!\" he replied: \"may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me.\" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, \"O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?\"; whereto he answered, \"Yes!\" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body.\" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, \"This is doing injury to the keeper's rights.\" Replied the Fireman, \"The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!\" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, \"Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!\" \"Leave this talk,\" replied the other, \"and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding.\" \"Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,\" said Zau al-Makan; \"and after I will tell thee my story.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage.\" And he added, \"But where am I now?\" \"Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,\" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,\n\n\"In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    them made me suffer resurrection throe:\nOh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;\nNor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    lighten, easing this excess of woe:\nQuoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' \"\n\nThen he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, \"Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery.\" Asked Zau al-Makan, \"How far is it hence to Damascus?\" Answered the other, \"Six days' journey.\" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Wilt thou send me thither?\" \"O my lord,\" quoth the Stoker, \"how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee.\" Then said he to his wife, \"Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men.\" Replied she, \"I will go with you both;\" and he rejoined, \"Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!\" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, \"Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in.\" Replied he, \"Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Thy will is mine.\" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!\" So he asked one of the eunuchs, \"Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, \"These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria.\" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,\n\n\"Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in my spirit shall ever dwell!\nYour charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no pleasures its sour dispel;\nIf Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     love I'll tell.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, \"O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee.\" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:\nAll thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:\nSay is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   of day?\"\n\nAnd he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, \"Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?\" \"Yes,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land.\" Said the Stoker, \"And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel.\" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, \"Allah abundantly requite thee for me!\" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, \"This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk.\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother.\" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,\n\n\"Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   tormentry,\nAnd cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy\nAnd longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy\nNo cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:\nThe love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]\nO thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:\nBy Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:\nO Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!\"\n\nThen she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, \"This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her.\" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, \"Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?\" When she heard this, she said to him, \"By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!\" Quoth he, \"Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children.\" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, \"Haply I may trust myself to this old man.\" Then she said to him, \"O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am.\" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, I have got my desire!\" Then he turned to her and replied, \"There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us.\" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, \"O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!\" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, \"O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?\" When he heard her reply he cried out, \"O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?\" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, \"An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!\" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, \"How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?\" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, \"O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?\" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, \"By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!\" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,\n\n\"Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   condition for human race:\nIn this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    transgress his determined place:\nHow long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    in parlous case!\nAllah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    with disgrace after so much grace!\nMy wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     to greet his face:\nO thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tears shall flow evermore!\"\n\nWhen she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, \"I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done.\" \"Yes; whatso thou doest is right,\" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, \"Whatso thou doest is right!\" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, \"O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!\" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, \"I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price.\" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, \"How old is she?\" He answered \"She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, \"O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee.\" Quoth the Badawi, \"An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot.\" Rejoined the merchant, \"It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once.\" \"I agree with thee to this condition,\" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, \"O N\u00e1jiyah[FN#247]!\" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee.\" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, \"If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her.\" Then he bespake her, \"Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?\" She turned to him and replied, \"This also was registered in the Book of Destiny.\" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, \"I believe this one cometh to buy me;\" and she continued, \"If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer.\" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, \"And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe.\" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, \"What is her price, for indeed she is noble?\" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, \"Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!\" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, \"Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest.\" \"And how much wilt thou give me for her?\" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, \"Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire.\" Rejoined the Badawi, \"None shall name it but thou thyself.\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces.\" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, \"Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist.\" And he cried out to her, saying, \"Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee.\" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosro\u00ebs and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?\" Cried the Badawi, \"And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her.\" \"With thy leave,\" said the merchant, \"I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.\"[FN#250] Replied the other, \"Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked.\" Quoth the trader, \"Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.\"[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, \"O my mistress, what is thy name?\" She answered, \"Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?\" Thereupon the merchant enquired, \"Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?\" \"Yes,\" replied she, \"my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age.\" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, \"Hast thou not a sick brother?\" \"Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,\" quoth she, \"but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem.\" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, \"Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her.\" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,\n\n\"Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dwellest in my heart!\nAllah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Time, all dangers thwart!\nMine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    tears-ah me, how fast they start!\nWould Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in what house and tribe thou art\nA fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tear drops for my sole desert?\nAn thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and couch coals' burning smart?\nAll things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   this grief is hard to dree.\"\n\nWhen the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, \"Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, \"There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant.\" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,\n\n\"And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     sore disgrace.\nShe weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'What cure can meet this fatal case?'\"\n\nWhen she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, \"By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire.\" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt.\" \"Take her,\" quoth the Badawi, \"and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.\"[FN#254] Said the merchant, \"I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her.\" \"Allah will open!\"[FN#255] replied the Badawi. \"Seventy thousand,\" said the merchant. \"Allah will open!\" repeated the Badawi: \"this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces.\" The merchant rejoined, \"Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force.\" The Badawi continued, \"Say on!\" \"An hundred thousand,\" quoth the merchant. \"I have sold her to thee at that price,\" answered the Badawi; \"I shall be able to buy salt with her.\" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, \"Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also.\" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, \"All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic.\" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, \"O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee.\" Replied she, \"By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad.\" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, \"By Allah, I have won my wish!\" Then he said to her, \"Hast thou been shown to him in time past?\" She answered, \"No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus.\" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; \"and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burh\u00e1n; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Bayt\u00e1r, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge.\" Then quoth she to the merchant, \"Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out \"Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,\n\n\"I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?\nWhat makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    every lover strength such memories to own?\nHow sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:\nI pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to lover wightwi' love so woe begone\nComplains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pangs can break not only heart but stone.\"\n\nAnd when she had ended writing the verses she continued, \"These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,\n\n'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:\nNo lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight\nI bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' \"\nThen her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,\n\n\"Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     severed sleep and eyes for aye.\nI waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wouldst never say.\"\n\nThen she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, \"This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman.\" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, \"As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it.\" And she replied \"Hearing is obeying.\" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, \"Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!\" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, \"O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities.\" Quoth the King, \"Let me see it.\" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, \"O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences.\" Quoth the King to the trader, \"Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" replied the merchant; \"but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise.\" Said the King, \"I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her.\" Said the merchant, \"I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand.\" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, \"I will give thee a higher price than this for her;\" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, \"Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit.\" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, \"I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her.\" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, \"I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions.\" They answered, \"There is no evil in that!\"; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, \"Ye be welcome!\" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, \"This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King.\" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, \"O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty.\" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, \"O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects.\" She replied, saying: \"O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shad\u00edd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosro\u00ebs also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-first night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosro\u00ebs wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mans\u00far[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abb\u00e1s of T\u00fas said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n wrote to his brother Abd al-Az\u00edz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khatt\u00e1b[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n\nBy open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:\nWhoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     goal.'\"\n\nAnd Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, \"Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this.\" When she heard their words and understood them she said, \"As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Mays\u00fan, mother of Yez\u00edd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahn\u00e1f son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khatt\u00e1b,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Ab\u00fa M\u00fas\u00e1 al-Ash\u00e1ri[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziy\u00e1d.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest\" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basr\u00ed,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shadd\u00e1d, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,\n\n'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious\nis man happiest:\nIn truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make\nthe pious choicely blest.'\nThen quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter.\" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, \"When Omar bin Abd al-Az\u00edz[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, F\u00e1timah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, \"Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marw\u00e1n such as Abd al-Malik and Wal\u00edd and Sulaym\u00e1n[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Kh\u00e1lid bin Safw\u00e1n[FN#295] said, 'Y\u00fasuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, \"How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, \"Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well.\" There said the Kazis, \"O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives.\" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, \"Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds.\" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, \"There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me.\" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, \"After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-eighth night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, \"My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes.\" Then he wrote in verse,\n\n\"That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     heart's most honourable place I keep:\nSans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.\"\n\nThe letter went on, \"And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us.\" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, \"This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt.\" Quoth he, \"It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]\" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, \"Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?\" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, \"I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; and he continued, \"Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave.\" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, \"How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain.\" Then he raised his head and sighing said, \"O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know.\" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, \"What wilt thou call the girl?\" \"Call her Kuzia Fak\u00e1n,\"[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, \"After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, \"And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad.\" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, \"Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;\" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, \"O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?\" Replied she, \"Seek advice from thyself!\" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), \"Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free.\" \"Be it so,\" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and b\u00e2t-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, \"Who be the leader of the caravan?\" and they answered, \"The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, \"I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object.\" \"With joy and good will,\" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, \"Do thou mount with me.\" But he replied, \"Not so: I will be thy servant.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"There is no help for it but thou ride awhile.\" \"'Tis well,\" quoth the Stoker; \"I will ride when I grow tired.\" Then said Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk.\" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Ham\u00e1h,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diy\u00e1r Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:\nAh me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!\nNow trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:\nWhen say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' \"\n\nThereupon said to him the Fireman, \"Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" cried the other, \"cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!\" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,\n\n'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    despaireth me\nFor friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gree:\nIt minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.\nSay sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in joy and glee?\nO blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree,\nOf friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    calamity:\nAll bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    enemy.\nHe[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dregs, did he:\nI see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thee.\nTime! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    infancy,\nWhen joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    at me!\nWho aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    misery,\nThat wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?\nDoomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and care.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, \"What is thy will?\" Quoth she, \"Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now.\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I did not hear him\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, \"Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping.\" But she said, \"Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter.\" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, \"Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?\" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, \"By Allah, 'twas not I!\" Rejoined the Eunuch, \"Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake.\" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, \"Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt\"; so he answered, \"By Allah, I know not who it was.\" Said the Eunuch, \"By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him.\" \"By Allah,\" replied the Fireman, \"I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!\" Quoth the Eunuch, \"If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand.\" Said the Fireman, \"Go thou back and I will bring him to thee.\" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, \"None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer.\" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, \"What wilt thou do?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart.\" Quoth the other, \"Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch.\" \"Tell me what happened,\" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, \"Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'\" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, \"Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;\" and Zau al-Makan retorted, \"Needs must I recite verses.\" \"Verily,\" said the Stoker, \"needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?\" But Zau al-Makan answered, \"I will not be turned away from my purpose.\"[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sped:\nIf the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:\nIf the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   luscious red:\nO Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.\"\nAnd he also improvised the two following distichs,\n\n\"We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:\nWho shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Delight?''[FN#312]\n\nAnd as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, \"Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, \"Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him.\" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, \"It was thou didst recite the verses!\" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, \"No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!\" But the Eunuch said, \"I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him.\" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, \"By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all.\" \"Rise up and fare with me,\" rejoined the Eunuch, \"and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself.\" Quoth the Stoker, \"Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me.\" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened.\" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, \"Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.\"[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, \"Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee.\" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,\n\n\"I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:\nHe chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    grievously.\nThe blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    land[FN#314] to see:'\nThey ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    love to be:'\nThey ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ignomy:'\nWhate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flee:\nNor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me shame.\n\nHardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, \"Peace be with thee, O my lord!\" \"And on thee be peace,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!\" \"O my lord,\" continued the Eunuch\u2014-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!\"[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, \"O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news.\" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, \"Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him.\" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, \"How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!\" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, \"O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding.\" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, \"Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land.\" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition.\" Replied he, \"With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought.\" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, \"Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father.\" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, \"Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me.\" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, \"Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, \"Allah reunite him with what he loveth!\" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, \"Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country.\" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]\n\n\"Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    that hometh Hinda be forever blest'\nHer love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   before or after can for man have zest\n'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:\nHail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:\nAllah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.\"\nAnd also these,\n\n\"I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   highs\nI'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     maidens soft and white:\nTo sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bowl, while eyes rain lively light\n'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bank flowing through my garden site.\"\n\nWhen he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, \"O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!\" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, \"O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!\" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,\n\n\"Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]\nComes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   good news, rise, gird thy waist\nI spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Kausar[FN#319] on those lips\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]\n\n\"Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    railed from these eyne;\nAnd sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    never sound from tongue of mine:\nJoy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    eyes draws gouts of brine:\nTears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pleasure and you weep for pine!\"\n\nThey sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, \"Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me.\" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, \"Do thou begin thy tale.\" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, \"Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!\" And she added, \"Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee.\" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, \"Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him.\" Said she, \"Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power.\" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, \"Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me.\" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, \"Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan.\" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, \" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.\"[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time.\" \"Be it as thou biddest,\" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, \"Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us.\" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, \"Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!\" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, \"Oh would I knew what is become of him!\"; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, \"Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime.\" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, \"Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"What I feared hath befallen me.\" And he repeated this couplet,\n\n\"'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.\"\n\nThen the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, \"Take him off the ass.\" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, \"If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it.\" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, \"O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap.\" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, \"Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;\" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, \"Stay, and your loading delay!\"; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, \"What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?\" Asked they, \"Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?\" and he answered, \"I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad.\" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, \"In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan.\" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, \"Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!\" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, \"King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them.\" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, \"Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can.\" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, \"O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence.\" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, \"I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan.\" \"Aright thou reckest,\" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, \"Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.\"[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, \"How blessed is this gurney!\", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, \"The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both.\" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, \"I accept this position;\" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, \"O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?\" \"O my son,\" replied the Chamberlain, \"thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case.\" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sh\u00e1hmiy\u00e1nah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the \"Light of the Place.\" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, \"We hear and we obey;\" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, \"Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere.\" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, \"This needs must be!\" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, \"Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?\" \"I have no knowledge of the cause,\" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, \"I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" \"Know then, O King,\" replied Dandan, \"that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran\u2014and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, \"Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Sidd\u00edk[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     thee back the heart offended:\nFor hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     may nevermore be mended.'\n\nThe maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'\" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eightieth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukm\u00e1n[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,\n\nFreest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    others err, self error ne'er can sight:\nRiches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:\nIf by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    wrong and if the door be right, go right!'\n\nContinued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'\u00edd bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,\n\n'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban\nTo two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah trouble to thy brother man.'\nAnd how well saith the poet,\n\n'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     one who did collect,\nThou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     he did elect.'\n\nThen the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abid\u00edn,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufy\u00e1n al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Kh\u00e1lid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal\"[FN#354]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, \"And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' M\u00e1lik bin Din\u00e1r,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mans\u00far bin Amm\u00e1r,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Din\u00e1r used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Ab\u00fa H\u00e1zim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shih\u00e1b: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting\u2014thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm bin Adham, and Shak\u00edk al-Balkh\u00ed was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imr\u00e1n, 'A man once asked of H\u00e1tim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Ab\u00fa Han\u00edfah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One\n\nday a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,\n\n'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'\n\nAl-Rab\u00ed a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakr\u00e1 that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-H\u00e1ris bin Lab\u00edb al-Saff\u00e1r, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Han\u00edfah that the Commander of the Faithful, Ab\u00fa Ja'afar al-Mans\u00far, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe\u2014and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,\n\n'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and of grace entire:\nCast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    done by vain desire!'\n\nAmong the sayings of Sufy\u00e1n al-Thaur\u00ed, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halw\u00e1,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, \"O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, \"Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;\" and he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"Thou continues\" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, \"Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee.\" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, \"Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts.\" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, \"As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour.\" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, \"None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'\" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, \"It were fitting thou go forth to meet him.\" Zau al- Makan replied, \"I hear and I consent;\" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, tell me thy history.\" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, \"Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do.\" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, \"O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth.\" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, \"Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack.\" Said Hardub, \"Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power.\" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, \"The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them.\" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;\" and she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!\" And she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {\u200bhe standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us.\" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, \"Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!\" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, \"Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!\" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, \"Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat.\" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting \"Allaho Akbar!\" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, \"Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us.\" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, \"In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan.\" \"Tomorrow,\" said King Afridun, \"I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, L\u00fak\u00e1 bin Shaml\u00fat; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense.\" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, \"I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction.\" Quoth Luka, \"Hearkening and obedience;\" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, \"Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Sh\u00e1m[FN#393]!\" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, \"Of a surety they seek for thee.\" Said he, \"Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me.\" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, \"Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,\" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,\n\n\"I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     main:\nI have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:\nI have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     scabbard\" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.\"\n\nLuka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, \"By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!\" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, \"Where be the crosses?\" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, \"Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!\" and he answered, \"Adsum!\"[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, \"Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea.\" He replied, \"To hear is to obey!\"; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, \"On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;\" and the host of the Infidels shouted, \"Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!\" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, \"Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!\"[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, \"Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan.\" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, \"Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!\" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted \"Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!\" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, \"Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!\" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    locks, on day of fight and fray,\nO'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     many a whis kered knight to win the day.\"\nAnd as singeth another,\n\n\"I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     serve those looks that sword like show!'\nSays he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     who sweets of love unknow!'\"\n\nWhen Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, \"I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling.\" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, \"Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!\" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, \"O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay.\" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith.\" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of C\u00e6sarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, \"Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee.\" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, \"Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!\" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, \"O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!\" Replied the Patriarch, \"Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you.\" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, \"O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan.\" Replied the King, \"Be it so whenever thou wilt.\" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najr\u00e1n,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, \"Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?\" \"Yes,\" answered they; and he rejoined, \"Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward.\" \"O King,\" replied they, \"we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice.\" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, \"May the Messiah never fail thee!\" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.\u2014 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayh\u00e1nah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,\n\n\"Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     lesser men dost blench\nWho gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     carrion stench!\n\nAnd now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, \"O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides.\" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, \"It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear.\" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: \"These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith.\" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, \"Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem.\" Replied they, \"O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!\" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, \"Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!\" Replied they, \"How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?\" Then said she, \"We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'\" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,\n\n'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    soul in sea of bale and bate\nUnless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     than this doleful strait:\nO Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brighter charms thy shine abate,\nSay, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     barricado'd succour's gate?'\n\n\"When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,\" the old woman continued, \"how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man.\" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, \"Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, \"And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon.\" \"With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife.\" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, \"Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight.\" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,\n\n\"To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    back be borne a list;\nComes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    comes the friend withouten tryst.\"\nAnd these words of another,\n\n\"War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   scymitar for sire\nWith every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   won from Doom his dear desire!\"\n\nAnd when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, \"Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!\" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   frame her greeny cloak had spread.\nLooking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    waters balance in their bed,\nBut look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   leaf o'erwaves thy head.\"\n\nAnd as another saith,\n\n\"The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  is creeping shade of tamarisk stems\nRound legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   blossoms are the diadems.\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, \"O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels.\" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, \"O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us.\" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, \"We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels.\" Replied they, \"O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gh\u00e1zi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias.\" Asked Sharrkan, \"What was it ye won?\" \"O King,\" answered they, \"we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks.\" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, \"Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?\" Quoth they, \"We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price.\" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, \"Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, \"Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.\"[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,\n\n\"Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    art thou and this is time for aid:\nCast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]\nFor Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!\"\n\nWhen the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, \"I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down.\" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, \"Eat, O ascetic!\" But she said, \"This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King.\" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Sal\u00e1m or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, \"Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him.\" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present.\" Said the Wazir Dandan, \"And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world.\" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them \"Wherefore come ye?\", whereto they answered, \"O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?\" She rejoined, \"To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him.\" Quoth they, \"We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople.\" Now when she heard their words she said, \"By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakian\u00fas[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tam\u00e1sil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan.\" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage.\" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, \"I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage.\" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, \"As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you.\" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, \"Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms.\" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, \"Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!\" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, \"I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last.\" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, \"Slay this damned fellow.\"[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, \"By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them.\" His brother replied, \"And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople.\" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, \"Who can have given these troops information of us?\" Replied Sharrkan, \"O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;\" and the Wazir Dandan continued, \"If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them.\" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, \"What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour.\" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, \"Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight.\" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, \"Belike, he hath died a martyr.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ.\" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!\" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?\" Quoth the accursed hag, \"Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes.\" \"Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,\" rejoined Sharrkan, \"for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us.\" Replied she, \"I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain.\" Sharrkan said, \"As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs.\" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, \"Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake.\" Quoth they, \"We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah.\" \"If I do your bidding,\" replied she, \"blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee.\" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, \"Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn.\" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, \"Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?\" Answered he, \"Here am I!\" Take with thee thy Wazir,\" said she, \"and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople.\" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;\" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), \"When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun.\" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, \"Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!\" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, \"By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect.\" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not.\" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then Zau Al-Makan said, \"By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man who be with us?\" They rejoined, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, \"Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us.\" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, \"O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you.\" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, \"Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?\" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades \"What shall we do?\"; whereto all answered, \"That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us.\" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, \"If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him.\" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make.\" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, \"When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems.\" And quoth one of them, \"Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!\" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, \"It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please.\" Said they, \"This is the right course;\" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, \"O my brother, how win free?\" \"By Allah,\" replied Zau al Makan, \"I know not; for here we be like birds in cage.\" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, \"I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile.\" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, \"Better we take each one of us a steed.\" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, \"Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose.\" \"What is it?\" asked they and he answered, \"I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape.\" Rejoined Sharrkan, \"By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, \"I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it.\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\"; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, \"The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!\" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, \"They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you.\" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, \"What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith.\" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, \"Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!\" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, \"O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Mal\u00fakhin\u00e1 in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence.\" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, \"I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive.\" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, \"Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople.\" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, \"Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!\" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, \"O friend of Allah what is behind thee?\" Answered she, \"Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels.\" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, \"The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left.\" Said Bahram, \"O holy man! when didst thou leave them?\" \"But this night,\"[FN#437] replied she. He cried, \"Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.\"[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him.\" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. \"There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.\"[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, \"Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them.\" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]\n\n\"Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    not mine aid to be!\nThough was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    which vouchsafed victory:\nThou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    con quering sword of valiancy:\nThou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    generous boons dealt fain and free:\nThou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Age's noblest he!\nGarred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     back dight in War's cramoisie:\nThen made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   turning made them flee,\nAnd left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:\nThen came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for town and wold to see;\nWhen slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wherein sweet rill-lets well.\"\n\nBut, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, \"Welcome O pious recluse!\" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, \"In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man.\" And she cried to them, \"Haste! Haste!\" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, \"Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith.\" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, \"If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees.\" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom.\" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, \"There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;\" and Sharrkan cried out, \"How is it with the Moslems?\" \"All are sound and safe,\" replied they, \"and we came not but out of concern for you.\" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, \"O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?\" He answered, \"All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?\" Quoth Tarkash; \"It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious.\" They questioned him, \"And how did the Holy Man reach you?\"; and he replied, \"Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman.\" \"There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,\" said Sharrkan, \"but where is he now?\" They rejoined, \"We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless.\" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, \"This was writ in the Book.\" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, \"Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south.\" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, \"O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!\" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, \"By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!\" Said Sharrkan, \"Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment.\" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, \"Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!\" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,\n\n\"He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.\"[FN#444]\n\nSo the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, \"Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding.\" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: \"From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done.\" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, \"See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread.\" Rejoined Afridun, \"May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!\" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, \"Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!\" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, \"Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!\" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, \"O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought.\" Replied the Sultan, \"As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!\" \"It is my wish,\" added Sharrkan, \"to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee.\" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, \"I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance.\" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, \"What is with thee of news?\"; and quoth he, \"I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems.\" When Sharrkan heard this he said, \"O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye.\" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, \"No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered.\" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, \"Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shaw\u00e1hi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi.\" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, \"Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?\" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, \"Sharrkan is victor!\" and others, \"Afridun will conquer!\"; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt.\" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, \"May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan.\" Replied Afridun, \"To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail.\" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, \"The world will not readily afford his like!\" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, \"Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!\" And Sharrkan said, \"Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"All are weeping for thee.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?\" Now he was sitting by him and said, \"At thy head.\" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, \"O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work.\" Sharrkan rejoined, \"Pray for me,\" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, \"We will be thy sacrifice.\" He replied, \"By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses.\" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, \"Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?\" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, \"O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess.\" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,\n\n\"On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would collar Doom:\nHis steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    her nightliest gloom:\nWhose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rolling in thun d'rous boom:\nIf he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]\n\nThen each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of C\u00e6sarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" (God is most Great) and \"There is no god but the God!\", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, \"Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!\"; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee.\" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, \"By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!\" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, \"To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege.\" Then said Sharrkan to them, \"Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up.\" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, \"Welcome to the Holy Man!\" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, \"The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him.\" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, \"By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!\" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, \"Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me.\" So she turned and said to him from afar, \"Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society.\" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, \"I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning.\" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, \"Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered.\" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, \"Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?\" Quoth the Wazir, \"And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!\" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, \"By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!\" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, \"Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead.\" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, \"To hear is to obey!\" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, \"We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it.\" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, \"Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news.\" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, \"Who art thou?\"; and quoth she, \"I am Zat al- Dawahi.\" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, \"What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain.\" He answered, \"Yes;\" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!\" Then said she to King Afridun, \"Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses.\" Replied Afridun, \"Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness.\" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: \"From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!\" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, \"Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam.\" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, \"By Allah, my heart shrank from her!\" Quoth the Sultan, \"How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople.\" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,\n\n\"Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     be without a failure shall become;\nSoon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.\"\n\nWherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms.\" He replied, \"O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects.\" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him K\u00e1nm\u00e1k\u00e1n.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, \"Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, \"Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan.\" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Thy design is good.\" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]\nTill reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   men's souls who one sole God adore:\nNe'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   which heads of bearers bore:\nAh no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heaven earth ever covered o'er.\nIs the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    splendour o'er thy face shall pour?\nPraise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   confined he shall dispread the more!\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,\n\n\"Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done\nLeftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    th' ex change secure thee every benison!\nThou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.\nI see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   else must seek but please the Truthful One:\nTh' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:\nI bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.\"\n\n\nWhen the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,\n\n\n\"Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.\nSee'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     fray?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        dismay.[FN#458]\nBy Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:\nSave that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.\"\n\n\nAnd when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, \"I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened.\" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With joy and good will.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows\":\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.\u2014 cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it \"objectionable,\" reduces it to two of its episodes, Az\u00edz-cum-Az\u00edzah and T\u00e1j al-Mul\u00fak. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) \"Scharkan, Conte Arabe,\" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupr\u00e9. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. C\u00e6sarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. \"Nakf\u00far\" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which C\u00e6sarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that C\u00e9sar\u00e9e is a \"ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique\" (p. 20).\n\n[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.\n\n[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful \"King Kulayb,\" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.\n\n[FN#141] China.\n\n[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).\n\n[FN#143] In full \"Sharrun k\u00e1na\" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (k\u00e1na) that is, \"bane to the foe\" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance \"Al-Dalhamah\" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.\n\n[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).\n\n[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as \"Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia\" and to Moslems as \"Aye Sof\u00edyeh\" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called S\u00edr\u00edn and the other M\u00e1riyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed \"Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah.\" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with \"Bismillah,\" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually \"King of Arabia.\"\n\n[FN#146] This prayer before \"doing the deed of kind\" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.\n\n[FN#147] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).\nTorrens in his Notes cites Drayton's \"Moon-calf':\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Bring forth the birth-stool\u2014no, let it alone;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    She is so far beyond all compass grown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Some other new device us needs must stead,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Or else she never can be brought to bed.\nIt is the \"groaning-chair\" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This \"Kurs\u00ed al-wil\u00e1dah\" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called \"lower animals.\" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.\n\n[FN#148] Some Orientalists call \"lullilooing\" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others \"Ziraleet\" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically \"Tahl\u00edl\" and vulgarly \"Zaghrutah\" (Plur. Zagh\u00e1rit) and Persians \"Kil.\" Finally in Don Quixote we have \"Lelilies,\" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )\n\n[FN#149] i.e. \"Light of the Place\" (or kingdom) and \"Delight of the\nAge.\"\n\n[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zoh\u00e1k or Zahh\u00e1k to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.\n\n[FN#151] Arab. \"Yun\u00e1n\" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.\n\n[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold\n\"Philippi\" and \"Alexanders.\"\n\n[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), \"Ces talismans travaill\u00e9s par le ciseau du c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Califaziri,\" adding in a note, \"Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.\"\n\n[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.\n\n[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull\nEdit.\n\n[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.\n\n[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.\n\n[FN#158] In Arab. \"Khazinah\" or \"Khaznah\" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 \"K\u00eds\" or purses (each=\u00a35). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=\u00a335,000.\n\n[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.\n\n[FN#160] Arab \"Gh\u00e1bah\" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.\n\n[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunn\u00e1r or girdle.\n\n[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)\n\n[FN#163] \"Daw\u00e1h\u00ed,\" plur. of D\u00e1hiyah = a mishap. The title means \"Mistress of Misfortunes\" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Z\u00e1t al-Daw\u00e1h\u00ed.\n\n[FN#164] Arab. \"Kunfuz\"=hedgehog or porcupine.\n\n[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. \"\u00c9tourdie que vous \u00eates,\" says M. Riche, toning down the text.\n\n[FN#166] Arab. \"Zirt,\" a low word. The superlative \"Zarr\u00e1t\" (fartermost) or, \"Abu Zirt\" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Tagg\u00e1a (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.\n\n[FN#167] Arab. \"kicked\" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as \"spurring\" and \"pricking over the plain,\" because apt to give a wrong idea.\n\n[FN#168] Arab. \"Allaho Akbar!\" the classical Moslem slogan.\n\n[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.\n\n[FN#170] \"Batr\u00edk\" (vulg. Bitr\u00edk)=patricius, a title given to\nChristian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or\nNobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. K\u00e1id) two\nhundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or\nBatrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)\n\n[FN#171] Arab. \"K\u00e1zi al-Kuz\u00e1t,\" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Ab\u00fa Y\u00fasuf Ya'akab al-Ans\u00e1ri: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.\n\n[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: \"O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed\" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and D\u00edmnah) says:\u2014 \"Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly.\" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), \"Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;\" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came.\" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated \"Art thou not with thy Lord ?\" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.\n\n[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.\n\n[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)\n\n[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.\n\n[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. \"Kayim\" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or \"professor\" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)\n\n[FN#177] Lit. \"laughed in his face\" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.\n\n[FN#178] Arab. \"Abu riy\u00e1h\"=a kind of child's toy. It is our \"bull-roarer\" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.\n\n[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called \"Sea of Daylam.\" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. \"Dilem.\"\n\n[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.\n\n[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these \"captives possessed by the right hand.\"\n\n[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.\n\n[FN#183] And Solomon said, \"O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?\" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, \" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted\" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balk\u00eds or Bilk\u00eds (says the Durrat al-Ghaww\u00e1s) daughter of Hoz\u00e1d bin Sharhab\u00edl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical \" Queen of Sheba.\" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tab\u00e1bi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.\n\n[FN#184] Arab. \"Fass,\" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify \"a fine gem.\"\n\n[FN#185] This prominence of the glut\u00e6i muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind\n\n[FN#186] The \"bull\" is only half mine.\n\n[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the \"hot eye\" is one full of tears.\n\n[FN#188] i.e., \"Coral,\" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older \"Morgiana.\" I do not see why Preston in Al-Har\u00edni's \"Makamah (S\u00e9ance) of Singar\" renders it pearls, because Golius gives \"small pearls,\" when it is evidently \"coral.\" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.\n\n[FN#189] Arab. \"'Ud Jalaki\"=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.\n\n[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with \"pure\" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the \"Sanam\" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says \"it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise.\" (?)\n\n[FN#191] This \"hysterical\" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.\n\n[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the \u00c6olipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.\n\n[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed R\u00e1w\u00ed or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet S\u00e1hib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n A. H. 65-86.\n\n[FN#194] Jam\u00edl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with\nAl-Kuthayrir.\n\n[FN#195] Arab. \"Tafazzal,\" a word of frequent use in conversation=\"favour me,\" etc.\n\n[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin \"antimonium\" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zark\u00e1 (the blue eyed) of Yam\u00e1mah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Rib\u00e1h ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zark\u00e1 from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, \"O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!\" adding, in Rajaz verse:\u2014\n\nI swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!\n\nShe then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:\n\n\"Sharper-sighted than Zark\u00e1 of Jau\" (Yam\u00e1mah).\n\nSee C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.\n(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).\nI have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and\nfailed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.\n\n[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.\n\n[FN#198] Arab. \"Al-fil,\" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived \"elephant\" from P\u00edl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix\u2014as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-H\u00e1ris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of \"eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa.\" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.\n\n[FN#199] Arab. \"Shaukat\" which may also mean the \"pride\" or \"mainstay\" (of the army).\n\n[FN#200] Lit. \"smote him on the tendons of his neck.\" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.\n\n[FN#201] Arab. \"Dir\u00e1s.\" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called \"Norag,\" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the \"Tibn\" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.\n\n[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.\n\n[FN#203] Arab. \"Bika'\u00e1\": hence the \"Buka'ah\" or Clesyria.\n\n[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds \"unscientific \" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. \"Khatt\u00e1f,\" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of \"captivus\" through Italian and French\n\n[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.\n\n[FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.\n\n[FN#207] The \"wrecker\" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore\n\n[FN#208] Arab. \"Jokh\": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.\n\n[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.\n\n[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.\n\n[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated\n\n[FN#212] In text \"Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,\" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a \"Kal\u00e1m w\u00e1ti.\" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)\n\n[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.\n\n[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)\n\n[FN#215] Arab. \"Ashhab.\" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.\n\n[FN#216] She had already said to him \"Thou art beaten in everything!\"\n\n[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.\n\n[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such \"hocussing\" would be held quite fair.\n\n[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the \"wine-service\" was on a larger scale.\n\n[FN#220] Here the \"Bhang\" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.\n\n[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first \"sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called \" Saf\u00edyu'llah,\" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)\n\n[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.\n\n[FN#223] Arab. \"Insh\u00e1d,\" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt \"Munshid\" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.\n\n[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.\n\n[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'\u00e1. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword \"Samsam\" or \"Samsamah.\" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took \"Samsam\" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of \"Samsam.\"\n\n[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the \"Romance of Dalhamah\" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, \"If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.\"\n\n[FN#227] Arab. \"Sadda'l-Akt\u00e1r,\" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. \"Sadd,\" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymph\u00e6a and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.\n\n[FN#228] Arab. \"Al Marh\u00famah\": equivalent to our \"late lamented.\"\n\n[FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced \"Mahmal,\" and by Egyptians and Turks \"Mehmel.\" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).\n\n[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).\n\n[FN#231] \"Ir\u00e1k\" (Mesopotamia) means \"a level country beside the banks of a ever.\"\n\n[FN#232] \"Al Kuds,\" or \"Bays al-Mukaddas,\" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).\n\n[FN#233] \"Follow the religion of Abraham\" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled \"Khal\u00edlu'llah,\" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.\n\n[FN#234] Ab\u00e1, or Ab\u00e1yah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Al-Wakk\u00e1d,\" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"M\u00e1 al-Khal\u00e1f\" (or \"Khil\u00e1f\") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix \u00c6gyptiaca.\n\n[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.\n\n[FN#238] i.e., \"Thou art only just recovered.\"\n\n[FN#239] To \"Nakh\" is to gurgle \"Ikh! Ikh!\" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called \"Barr al-Man\u00e1khah\" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our \"Gee\" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.\n\n[FN#240] Arab. \"Laza,\" the Second Hell provided for Jews.\n\n[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1, note 199] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses \"Arabs of the Desert ;\" \"Arabs who dwell in tents,\" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). \"A'ar\u00e1bi\" is the classical word and the origin of \"Arab\" is disputed. According to Pocock (Not\u00e6 Spec. Hist. Arab.): \"Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited.\" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its \"Arabah,\" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of \"Arab\" from \"Ya'arab\" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called \"Eretz Ereb\" (or \"Arab\")=land of the West; but in Arabic \"Gharb\" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.\n\n[FN#242] \"When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,\" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.\n\n[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) \"Tartur\" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian \"Khalb\u00fas\" or \"Maskharah\" and the Turkish \"Sutari.\" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.\n\n[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say \"gnaw,\" which is not so good.\n\n[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first \"Shaykh.\"\n\n[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being \"sweated\" was soft and was soon worn down.\n\n[FN#247] Fem. of N\u00e1j\u00ed (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.\n\n[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). \"When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation.\" The longer answer to \"Peace be with (or upon) thee! \" is still universally the custom. The \"Salem\" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.\n\n[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.\n\n[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.\n\n[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.\n\n[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.\n\n[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.\n\n[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making \"doss stick.\"\n\n[FN#255] Arab \"Yaftah'Allah\" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.\n\n[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed (Mohammed ibn Idr\u00eds) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)\n\n[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"Bakh\" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin \"Euge.\"\n\n[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to \"skip\" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.\n\n[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)\nwhich means \"Flour and milk,\" or \"high lion.\" The text alludes to\nArdeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of\nBabak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See\nD,Herberot, and the Dabistan.\n\n[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, \"Folk follow their King's faith,\"\n\"Cujus regio ejus religio\" etc.\n\n[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).\n\n[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.\n\n[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying \"Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.\"\n\n[FN#265] Our \"honour amongst thieves.\"\n\n[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the \"sons of the little mother\" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.\n\n[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tam\u00edm and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, \"Sire of the Sea.\"\n\n[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by \"Takhf\u00edf\"; the Lib\u00e1n Sh\u00e1mi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions\n\n[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, \"This is the C\u00e6sar of the Arabs,\" while his wife called him a \"fatted ass.\"\n\n[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when \"exercised\" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; \"woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;\" and the modern addition is, \"whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.\"\n\n[FN#271] i.e. \"When ready and in erection.\"\n\n[FN#272] \"And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls\" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.\n\n[FN#273] It was popularly said that \"Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend.\" Entitled \"The Just\" he was murdered by Abu L\u00fal\u00faah, alias F\u00edr\u00faz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Magh\u00edrah for denying him justice.\n\n[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See\nD'Herbelot s.v. \"Asch\u00e1ri.\"\n\n[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph\nMu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.\n\n[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin As\u00e1kir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: \"never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:\" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called \"writer of the Koran\" from his edition of the M.S., and \"Lord of the two Lights\" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or\" limping Othman,\" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijm\u00e1' al-Muslim\u00edn, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies \"Lynch law.\" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.\n\n[FN#277] \"N\u00e1r\" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. \"bring me a light, a coal (bassah)\" etc.; but if you say \"bring me fire! \" the enemy will probably remark \"He wanteth fire even before his time!\" The slang expression would be \"bring the sweet.\" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)\n\n[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, \"All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali.\" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, \"This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar.\" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a \"pocket. Hercules,\" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his \"Cantiloquium\" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his \"Sentences\" and D'Herbelot s. D. \"Ali\" and \"Gebr.\" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.\n\n[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.\n\n[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from \"shad\" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).\n\n[FN#281] \"Haphsa\" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.\n\n[FN#282] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)\n\n[FN#283] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#284] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.\n\n[FN#285] A theologian of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#286] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, \" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee.\" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,\n\n[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. \"Bikr\" is the usual form, but \"Bakr,\" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him \"Pir-i-Kaft\u00e1r,\" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.\n\n[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.\n\n[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of\nOmar bin al-Khattab.\n\n[FN#290] Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.\n\n[FN#291] So the Turkish proverb \"The fish begins to stink at the head.\"\n\n[FN#292] Calling to the slaves.\n\n[FN#293] When the \"Day of Arafat\" (9th of Z\u00fa'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or \" Lesser Pilgrimage\" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title \"Hajj al-Asghar\" the \"Lesser Hajj.\" But \"Umrah\" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Saf\u00e1 (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady F\u00e1timah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).\n\n[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.\n\n[FN#295] Chief of the Ban\u00fa Tam\u00edn, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tam\u00edm, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor an uncle nobler than Tam\u00edm.\n\nThe high minded Tam\u00edn is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, \"Art thou now Tam\u00edn and then Kays?\"\n\n[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.\n\n[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).\n\n[FN#298] Or \"clothe thee in worn-out clothes\" i.e. \"Become a Fakir\" or religious mendicant.\n\n[FN#299] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.\n\n[FN#300] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Az\u00e1n or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the \"Ik\u00e1mah\" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the \"Sortes Coranic\u00e6,\" etc.\n\n[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.\n\n[FN#302] Meaning, \"It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,\" appropriate if not neat.\n\n[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from \"Bukhtar\" (Bactria), the \"Eastern\" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.\n\n[FN#304] \"Kayl\u00falah\" is the \"forty-winks\" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, \"Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not.\" \"Ayl\u00falain\" is slumbering after morning prayers (our \"beauty-sleep\"), causing heaviness andid leness: \"Ghayl\u00falah\" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: \"Kayl\u00falah\" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and \"Fayl\u00falah\" is slumbering after sunset\u2014both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)\n\n[FN#305] The Biblical \"Hamath\" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Har\u00e1m).\n\n[FN#306] When they say, \"The levee flashes bright on the hills of\nAl-Yaman,\" the allusion is to the south quarter, where\nsummer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,\nI have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and\nAl-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.\n[FN#307] Again \"he\" for \"she,\" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the \"veiled sex.\" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.\n\n[FN#308] The normal pun on \"Nuzhat al-Zaman\" = Delight of the Age or Time.\n\n[FN#309] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.\n\n[FN#310] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the \"B\u00e1d- i-Sab\u00e1\"=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.\n\n[FN#311] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.\n\n[FN#312] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.\n\n[FN#313] The idea is essentially Eastern, \"A lion at home and a lamb abroad\" is the popular saying.\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Hubb al-Watan\" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says \"Min al-Im\u00e1n\" (=is part of man's religion).\n\n[FN#315] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.\n\n[FN#316] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.\n\n[FN#317] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.\n\n[FN#318] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.\n\n[FN#319] \"Kausar,\" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.\n\n[FN#320] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.\n\n[FN#321] The \"insula\" of Sancho Panza.\n\n[FN#322] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.\n\n[FN#323] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.\n\n[FN#324] I have derived this word from the Persian \"rang\"=colour, hue, kind.\n\n[FN#325] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"N\u00edmshah\" from the Pers. N\u00edmchah, a \"half-sword,\" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).\n\n[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.\n\n[FN#328] Arab. \"Marh\u00fam\" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, \"of blessed memory\" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of \"upon whom be peace,\" as opposed to the imprecation, \"May the name of the wicked rot!\"\n\n[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.\n\n[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for \"another and a better.\"\n\n[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the \"Mi'r\u00e1j\" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.\n\n[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).\n\n[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to \"hanging judges\" in the Far West.\n\n[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon. He will be noticed in a future Night.\n\n[FN#336] \u00c6sop, according to the Arabs: of him or rather of the two\nLukmans, more presently.\n\n[FN#337] Koran ii. 185.\n\n[FN#338] Mohammed.\n\n[FN#339] One of the Ash\u00e1b or Companions of Mohammed.\n\n[FN#340] A noted traditionist at Cufa in the seventh century.\n\n[FN#341] Koran, chaps. lxxiv. I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. \"Clots of Blood.\" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.\n\n[FN#342] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.\n\n[FN#343] In the Mac. Edit. \"Abd\" for \"Sa'id.\" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.\n\n[FN#344] Arab. \"Shirk,\" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by \"polytheism,\" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea\n\n[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams\n(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.\n\n[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)g\u00e1h. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Nam\u00e1z-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the \"Ta'ar\u00edf,\" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Al-H\u00e1fi,\" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Kh\u00e1lid bin Wal\u00edd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahb\u00e1r near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halb\u00e1un) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the \"Ingr\u00edz\" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.\n\n[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.\n\n[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.\nThose curious about these unimportant names will consult the great\nBiographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by Baron\nMacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).\n\n[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the \"Im\u00e1m\" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means \"leader\": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an \"Imam to mankind.\"\n\n[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.\n\n[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.\n\n[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for \"differing in opinion\" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.\n\n[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).\n\n[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#357] \"Azal,\" opp. to \"Abad,\" eternity without end, infinity.\n\n[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.\n\n[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"M\u00fas\u00e1\": the Egyptian word was \"Mesu,\" the \"child\" or the \"boy\" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it \"Mosheh\" or \"one drawn out of the water;\" \"Mu\" in Egypt being water, the Arab \"Ma\"; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. \"Moyeh ,\" vulg. Egyptian for water.\n\n[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).\n\n[FN#362] Arab. \"Taub\" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. \"Tob\") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.\n\n[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a \"next world.\"\n\n[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)\n\n[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), \"The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey.\" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.\n\n[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.\nDisc. sect. viii.\n\n[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.\n\n[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).\n\n[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.\n\n[FN#371] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Daw\u00e1nik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.\n\n[FN#372] \"L\u00e1 rayba f\u00ed-hi\" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.\n\n[FN#373] Arab. \"Riv\u00e1l al-Ghayb,\" somewhat like the \"Himalayan Brothers\" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these \"Mard\u00e1n-i-Ghayb\" (Pers.), a \"class of people mounted on clouds,\" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu \"Lokap\u00e1las.\" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.\n\n[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.\n\n[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.\n\n[FN#376] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.\n\n[FN#377] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.\n\n[FN#378] Arab. \"Zunn\u00e1r,\" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the \"Janeo\" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocqui\u00e8re speak of \"Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,\" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.\n\n[FN#379] \"Sil\u00e1h d\u00e1r\" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an \"armour-bearer,\" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a \"young man\" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)\n\n[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.\n\n[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.\n\n[FN#382] Arab. \"Ghazwah,\" the corrupt Gallicism, now\nEuropeanised=raid, foray.\n[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.\n\n[FN#384] Arab. \"Nims\u00e1;\" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. \"Nemica\" (any Germans), literally meaning \"The dumb\" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.\n\n[FN#385] Arab. \"Dub\u00e1r\u00e1\" from the Slav. \"Dubrovnik,\" from \"Dub\" (an oak) and \"Dubrava\" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word \"Argosy.\" D'Herbelot calls it \"Dobravenedik\" or \"Good Venice,\" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).\n\n[FN#386] Arab. \"Jawarnah,\" or, \"J\u00farnah\" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.\n\n[FN#387] Arab. \"Banu'l-Asfar;\" which may mean \"Pale faces,\" in the sense of \"yeller girls\" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not \"white men,\" but \"red men;\" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste N\u00e1gar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. \"Svetadvipa\"\u2014Whiteman's Land.\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Al-Musakhkham.\" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnab\u00e6.) Hence the resurrection is called not \"Kiy\u00e1mah\" but \"Kum\u00e1mah\"=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, \"certain beasts in the shape of men\" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for \"Isa,\" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)\n\n[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.\n\n[FN#390] Again the coarsest word \"Khara.\" The allusion is to the\nvulgar saying, \"Thou eatest skite!\" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).\nDecent English writers modify this to, \"Thou eatest dirt:\" and Lord\nBeaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into \"eating sand.\"\n[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite\nEasterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a\nChristian parody the opening words of the Koran, \"Bismillahi 'l-\nRahm\u00e1ni 'l-Rah\u00edm, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,\" roughly translated,\n\n\"In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede.\" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.\n\n[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.\n\n[FN#393] Syria, the \"left-hand land\" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is \"Sh\u00e1mi sh\u00fami!\"\u2014the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanic\u00e8). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed \"Ab\u00fa Sh\u00e1m\" (Father of Syria) and insulted as \"Abuser of the Salt\" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were \"Bakh, bakh\" (=euge, before noticed), and \"Kakh,\" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to \"cack.\" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)\n\n[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. \"They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.\"\n\n[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.\n\n[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (\"I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,\" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle \"whose name shall be Ahmad.\" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial\u2014\"the mair the miracle,\" said the old Scotch lady. The \"Psalms of David\" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.\n\n[FN#397] Arab. \" Labbayka; \" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,\n\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\nL\u00e1 Shar\u00edka lake, Labbayk'!\nInna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\n\nSome add \"Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.\"With the \"Talbiyah\" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, \"By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!\" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun \"Talbiyah,\" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kiss\u00eds\" (plur.

The Lis\u00e1m of the African Taw\u00e1rik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The K\u00fafiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Co\u00ebffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littr\u00e9, the Learned, who in erudition was n\u00e9 coiff\u00e9, has missed this obvious derivation.\n\n[FN#404] \"Cutting,\" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and \"thrusting\" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.\n\n[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.\n\n[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where \"Koss the eloquent\" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najr\u00e1n (Nejr\u00e2n of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajj\u00e1, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.\n\n[FN#407] The Kant\u00e1r (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.\n\n[FN#408] Arab. \"Jur\u00e1b (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),\" the \"curdling of the testicles\" in fear is often mentioned.\n\n[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by medi\u00e6val Jews.\n\n[FN#410] Arab. \"Sah\u00e1kah,\" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this \"Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love \"; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as \"bazar\" hence Tabz\u00edr=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates \" Bazarah\" by slut or wench. He adds \" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zamb\u00far and which are cut off in girlhood.\" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabz\u00edr. Both writers confuse excision of the nymph\u00e6 with circumcision of the clitoris (Zamb\u00far) Al-Siy\u00fati (Kitab al-Iz\u00e1' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as \"Gamiani,\" and \"Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,\" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.\n\n[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile \"two reds,\" i.e. meat and wine; while the \"two reds,\" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:\u2014 \"Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent.\" (Mishk\u00e1t al-Mas\u00e1b\u00edh ii. 361.)\n\n\n[FN#412] These are the \"Hib\u00e1s\" or thin cords of wool which the\nBadawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.\n(Pilgrimage iii. 78).\n\n[FN#413] Crying out \"La il\u00e1ha illa 'llah.\" (There is no god but the\nGod.); technically called \"Tahl\u00edl.\"\n\n[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the \"Triloka\" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alam\u00edn (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.\n\n[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal.

The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).\n\n[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, \"until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.\"\n\n[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.\n\n[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osm\u00e1n P\u00e1sh\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, whom the English press dubbed \"Ghazi Osman.\"\n\n[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.\n\n[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: \" Shambar\" is the\nArab. form of the Persian \" Chambar.\"\n\n[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jal\u00e1l al-D\u00edn, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, \" they (martyrs) are not dead but living\" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.\n\n[FN#423] Tor is \"Mount Sinai\" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: \"It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safs\u00e1fah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of R\u00fcppell\" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the \"Sinaitic\" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Ar\u00e1if, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes \"Sain\u00e1\" and \"S\u00edn\u00edn\") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root \"Sanah\"=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with \"Sin,\" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.\n\n[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.\n\n[FN#425] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" lit. \"signs,\" here \"miracles of the truth,\" 1. c.

The Caliph Al-N\u00e1sir li-D\u00edni ll\u00e1h (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khald\u00fan, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.\n\n[FN#431] Mohammed who declared \"There is no monkery in Al-Islam,\" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhb\u00e1n).

Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that \"the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;\" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.\n\n[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed.

Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament.

In other words, we must consider the relation between our general subject of Christian tradition and the \u201ccanon\u201d of Scripture. When we speak of the \u201ccanon\u201d of Scripture we use the word in a different sense from that of \u201crule\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d; the \u201ccanon\u201d of Scripture is originally the \u201clist\u201d of books recognized by the church as her sacred writings, a use of the word first attested, it appears, in Athanasius.1\u00a0But inevitably, because of the close relation between Scripture and the rule of faith, something of the sense of authority has come to be attached in common usage to the terms \u201ccanon\u201d and \u201ccanonical\u201d when they refer to the books of the Bible.\n\nThis is an area in which the most biblicist and anti-traditionalist Christian communities rely perforce upon tradition, a tradition which in fact is more essential the more biblicist a community it is. For the more essential the more biblicist a community is, the more dependent it is for its authority on sola scriptura, and the more necessary it is to define\u00a0sola scriptura. In other words, the more Christians aim at being \u201cpeople of one book,\u201d the more important it is for them to know the limits of that one book.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Delimiting The Canon\n\nThere are some churches in which the limits of the canon are laid down by authority; their members (formally, at any rate) accept these limits because their church has defined them. This is true, for instance, of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and those churches which adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith. But what of churches which do not have the canon of Scripture delimited for them in this way? (I write now of my own heritage.) On what authority (say) do we accept the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, as commonly reckoned, either rejecting the Apocrypha altogether or else relegating them to an inferior or \u201cdeuterocanonical\u201d status? \u201cWe accept these thirty-nine books,\u201d it may be said, \u201cbecause they make up the Hebrew Bible which our Lord and the apostles acknowledged.\u201d True there seems to have been common ground between our Lord and the Jewish scribes of His day on the content of Scripture, however much they differed on its interpretation and application. We may be sure that He and they accepted the threefold corpus of Law, Prophets, and Writings as it was known from the second century B.C. if not earlier.2\u00a0But, in view of the fact that the precise limits of the third group, the \u201cWritings,\u201d do not appear to have been fixed by Jewish authority until the last quarter of the first century A.D., can we be quite sure that our Lord accepted (say) Ecclesiastes or Esther? lf, as the argument from silence might suggest, Esther was unknown as a canonical book to the Qumran community; would it be surprising to discover that it was similarly unknown in our Lord\u2019s circle? Yet we accept Ecclesiastes and Esther as part of Holy Scripture. Why? Not, in our case, because ecclesiastical authority so directs us stubborn individualists as many of us are. If ecclesiastical authority did so direct us, that in itself might stimulate us to refuse the direction. No, we accept them, l suppose, because we have \u201creceived\u201d them as included in Holy Writ, in other words, because of our tradition. Our tradition is not inviolably sacrosanct, but unless strong reason is shown for rejecting something that we so receive, like the canonicity of these books, we go along with it.\n\nTake an example of another kind: the Book of Enoch.4 We do not accept this book as canonical. It is not so accepted either by western Catholicism (the rock from which we were hewn) or by eastern Orthodoxy, although it is part of the Bible of the Monophysite Ethiopic church. Yet it is quoted, and quoted as authoritative, by a New Testament writer5. We cannot dismiss Jude\u2019s Enoch quotation as on a level with Paul\u2019s quotations from Menander6\u00a0or Epimenides7; Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch as other New Testament writers quote the Hebrew prophets, treating the words as a divine oracles8. No doubt it would put too great a strain on our intellectual agility to defend the divine inspiration of the whole Book of Enoch, even if other parts of it have influenced thought and language elsewhere in the New Testament.9\u00a0But it is not because of the difficulty of defending the inspiration of the Book of Enoch that we do not accept it; it is primarily because our tradition does not recognize it: we have not \"received\" it. Certainly, if valid arguments were forthcoming for the acceptance of this book, we might revise our tradition and accept it; otherwise, we go along with our tradition.\n\nHowever, Jude\u2019s quotation of a passage from the Book of Enoch as a divine oracle might prompt the query whether the Letter of Jude itself should be accepted as canonical. It was one the \u201cdisputed\u201d books in the early church,10 and Luther put it among the four New Testament books to which he accorded a lower canonical status than the other twenty-three.11\u00a0But this raises the problem of the New Testament canon, a knottier problem than that of the Old Testament canon. Apart from such questions as might be raised about \u201cmarginal\u201d books like Eccesiastes and Esther, the Christian biblicist can properly say that he accepts the Old Testament not on the authority of ecclesiastical tradition but on that of our Lord and the apostles. He has no such short answer to the question of the New Testament canon. These, then, are some of the questions which arise when this subject is under consideration.\n\n\nThe Old Testament Canon\n\nThe earliest Christians, as we have seen, found their sacred writings ready at hand in the books of the Hebrew Bible, either in their original text or in the Greek version. The acceptance of the Old Testament was indubitably something which they \u201creceived from the Lord\u201d by example as well as by instruction. For, to reproduce a purple passage from a distinguished Old Testament scholar of a past generation:\n\"For us its supreme sanction is that which it received from Christ Himself. It was the Bible of His education and the Bible of His ministry. He took for granted its fundamental doctrines about creation, about man and about righteousness; about God\u2019s Providence of the world and His purposes of grace through Israel. He accepted its history as the preparation for Himself, and taught His disciples to find Him in it. He used it to justify His mission and to illuminate the mystery of His Cross. He drew from it many of the examples and most of the categories of His gospel. He reinforced the essence of its law and restored many of its ideals. But, above all, He fed His own soul with its contents, and the great crises of His life sustained Himself upon it as upon the living and sovereign Word of God. These are the highest external proofs -- if indeed we can call them external-- for the abiding validity of the Old Testament in the life and doctrine of Christ\u2019s Church. What was indispensable to the Redeemer must always be indispensable to the redeemed.12\"\n\nIn the apostolic age there is no sign that Christians felt the need of a New Testament in the sense of a collection of writings. They had the sacred writings which their Lord used and fulfilled, writings which not only conveyed the way of \u201csalvation through faith in Christ Jesus\u201d but which also, being divinely inspired, were \u201cprofitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.13\u201d These writings, until well into the second century, constituted the church\u2019s Bible, read, of course, through Christian spectacles. From them the apostles of the first century and the apologists of the second century drew their basic texts as they proclaimed and defended the gospel; the reading of them was sufficient to convince a number of educated pagans of the truth of Christianity.14\n\nOne thing which does not seem to have greatly concerned those early Christians was the precise delimitation of their Bible. Actually, there was no particular reason why they should be greatly concerned; they were all agreed about its main contents. It is commonly supposed that the threefold division of the Hebrew Bible corresponds to three stages in the growth of the Hebrew canon.15\u00a0The Law and the Prophets were firmly established as well-defined bodies of canonical literature long before the Christian era, and so were most of the \u201cWritings.\u201d The grandson of Jesus ben Sira tells how his grandfather, at the beginning of the second century B.C., was a student of \u201cthe law and the prophets and the other books of our fathers.16\u201d Our Lord apparently knew His Bible as beginning with Genesis and ending with Chronicles,17\u00a0as the Hebrew Bible traditionally does and He is recorded as speaking of \u201ceverything that is written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms.\u201d Since the Psalter is the first book of the \u201cWritings,\u201d it has sometimes been thought that \u201cthe psalms\u201d here might indicate the whole group of documents which it introduces, but this is uncertain. This third group was not authoritatively \u201cclosed\u201d until after the catastrophe of A.D. 70, when the rabbis of Jamnia, Yochanan ben Zakkai and his colleagues, undertook the reconstitution of the Jewish polity on a religious basis. But although the \u201cWritings\" had remained open until then, so that they could freely discuss the admission of fresh documents or the eviction of others, their final decision seems to have been the confirmation of traditional practice.18\u00a0Josephus, writing towards the end of the first century, treats the whole canon of Hebrew scripture as closed and reckons its contents to be twenty-two books in all (a total designed to coincide with the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet).19\n\nChristians, however, and particularly Gentile Christians, would not feel bound by the decrees of Jamnia. The rank and file who used the Greek version might include among their sacred books works which were closely associated with those of whose canonicity there was no doubt, although the better informed made a distinction in theory, at least, between those which were part of the Hebrew Bible and those which were not. Here and there in the New Testament we find introduced by a formula which normally indicates a Scripture quotation something which cannot be identified in any Old Testament text known to us (or, for the matter of that, in any other text known to us).20\u00a0Jude not only quotes from the Book of Enoch,21\u00a0but also alludes to an incident which was probably recorded in the Assumption of Moses.22\u00a0It is striking, however, that from \u201cthe Books commonly called Apocrypha\u201d no quotation appears to be made by any New Testament writer.23\n\nThe earliest Christian list of Old Testament books, compiled about A.D. 170\u00a0by Melito, bishop of Sardis, was based on information which he received while travelling in Syria;24\u00a0it comprises all the books of the Hebrew Bible except Esther.25\u00a0Just a little later is a list preserved in a manuscript in the Library of the Greek Patriarchate in Jerusalem in which the title of each book is given both in Hebrew (or Aramaic) and in Greek.26\u00a0Origen (C. A.D. 230) also gives us a list of Old Testament books with their Hebrew and Greek titles; the Book of the Twelve Prophets is accidentally omitted from the textual tradition of his list but is required to make up his total. \u201cOutside these,\u201d he adds, \u201care the books of Maccabees.\u201d27\u00a0Athanasius (A.D. ) communicated to his fellow bishops a list of canonical books, including all the books of the Hebrew Bible except Esther; Esther he includes, along with Wisdom, Ben Sira, Judith, and Tobit, among those \u201cother \u2018books outside our list which are not canonical, but have been handed down from our fathers as suitable to be read to new converts.\"28\n\nAs late as the second half of the fourth century, then, there survived in the church a strong tradition putting the books contained in the Hebrew Bible on a higher level than those not contained in it, although doubts persisted regarding the status of Esther.\n\nThe question of the Old Testament canon is discussed by Jerome in the prologues to his Latin translation of the books of Samuel (or, as he called them, I and II Kings), of the Solomonic books and of Daniel. Jerome\u2019s acquaintance with Hebrew was far in advance of that of any other father of the western church --far in advance, one might say, of that of any other church father in west or east after the time of Origin -- and he attached high importance to the \u201cHebraic verity,\u201d as he put it. It was he who first used the adjective \u201capocryphal\u201d of the books outside the Hebrew canon,29\u00a0indicating not that they were in any sense spurious but that although the church \u201cdoes not receive them within the canonical scriptures,\u201d yet she \u201creads them for the edification of the people, not to confirm the authority of ecclesiastical dogmas.\u201d30\n\nBut Jerome\u2019s careful distinction tended to be forgotten by others who had no direct access, as he had, to the Hebrew Bible and who had received the books which he called the Apocrypha together with those which belonged to the Hebrew canon. Augustine, for example, reckons the Old Testament books as forty-four in number (including Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, I and II Maccabees),31\u00a0and the same view was accepted in his time by the Synod of Hippo (393) and the Third Synod of Carthage (397).\n\nBut the law was not laid down dogmatically about the limits of the Old Testament canon: they remained a matter of tradition until the sixteenth century.32\u00a0It was in the Reformation period that a serious issue was made of them. While the Anglicans and Lutherans generally followed the precedent of Jerome,33\u00a0treating the apocryphal books as unsuitable for the establishment of doctrine, the Council of Trent (1546) ignored his precedent and declared that all the books in the Vulgate were canonical without distinction, and at the opposite extreme the Reformers who followed the pattern of Geneva ultimately took the line that \u201cthe Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are not part of the canon of the Scripture and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.\u201d35\n\nThe position taken up at Trent was reaffirmed at Vatican Council I (1869-70),36 but in practice the distinction made by Jerome is observed today by many Roman Catholic scholars, who find it convenient to use the old classification of biblical books into \u201cprotocanonical\u201d and \u201cdeuterocanonical.\u201d37\u00a0But positions taken up in an atmosphere of controversy tend to be maintained as party traditions: there are, for example, some people even today who, not being well versed in the history or status of the apocryphal books, think of them as in some sense the perquisite of Rome. Thus a reviewer of the New English Bible, criticizing it for including these books, remarked: \u201cRome can rightly rejoice that at last her view of the canon of Scripture has displaced that of the Apostolic Church\u201d38\u00a0as though all the major Protestant versions of the complete Bible, from Coverdale to the Revised Standard Version, had not included the Apocrypha as a matter of course.\n\nThe New Testament Canon\n\nWhile the Old Testament constituted the church\u2019s earliest Bible, it was the Old Testament read and applied in the light of the gospel. The gospel God\u2019s final and perfect word to men was supremely authoritative, since it was embodied in Christ Himself, the church\u2019s Lord. But for a generation and more there was no need to appeal to a written record of the gospel even if from an early date there were notes or digests of the ministry or teaching of Jesus, compiled for the use of preachers or teachers, no particular authority attached to such notes or digests. The authority belonged to the message which they documented, and ultimately to the Lord whom the message proclaimed. His authority could not be rated below that of the prophets who foretold His coming: Clement of Rome, for instance, quotes \u201cthe words of the Lord Jesus\u201d on the same level as the Spirit\u2019s utterances through Jeremiah and Hannah.\u201d39\n\nThe authority of the Lord was exercised by His specially commissioned apostles,40\u00a0as may be seen both in those whose base was Jerusalem and in Paul as he pursued his Gentile mission and directed his Gentile churches. The Jerusalem decree of Acts l5:29 is an early example of the authority wielded by the Jerusalem apostles, and a careful reading of Paul\u2019s letters indicates that they or, if not themselves in person, then others in their name tried to extend their authority over his mission field.41\u00a0Paul, for his part, teaches his converts to recognize in his writings \u201ca command of the Lord\u201d (I Cor.\u00a014:37) and indicates that he lays down one \u201crule in all the churches\u201d (I Cor.\u00a07:17; cf.\u00a011:16;\u00a014:33b). But in writing to a church outside the area of his own apostolic responsibility, he shows the restraint and delicacy that he would have liked his fellow apostles to exhibit in their approach to his churches.42\n\nAfter the apostolic age, however, the recognition of separate spheres of apostolic service disappeared. While in the second century we find Marcion, on the one hand, venerating Paul as the only faithful apostle of Jesus,43\u00a0and the Ebionites, on the other hand, execrating the memory of Paul and exalting the names of Peter and especially James the Just,44\u00a0the church as a whole carried out in practice Paul\u2019s own exhortation to recognize that all the apostles and teachers \u201cwhether Paul or Apollos or Cephas\u201d belonged to them all (I Cor.\u00a03:22). However unhistorical we may judge the claim of the churches of Rome and Corinth to be joint-foundations of Peter and Paul,45\u00a0the attitude expressed in such a claim was a sound one. And this attitude finds expression in the New Testament canon, where every document that could colourably be called apostolic found its place in due course.\n\nThe gospels, anonymous though they were, were recognized as transcripts of the apostolic witness to Christ and, from an early point in the second century, were brought together, so that they no longer circulated separately in their respective constituencies but as a fourfold collection. It is difficult to say how far advanced this process was in the time of Ignatius, but he clearly had a written gospel to appeal to, and equally clearly he had to contend with more conservative brethren who disapproved of the idea of appealing to any written authority alongside the Old Testament scriptures as interpreted in the church\u2019s oral tradition. This is the point of the reference in his Letter to the Philadelphians, to those people who asserted \u201clf l do not find it in the archives [the Old Testament], l do not believe it [if it is contained] in the gospel.\u201d To which he replied \u201clt is written\u201d \u201cScripture says\u201d (meaning that the gospel is \u201cscripture\u201d). But they say, \u201cThat is the very point at question\u201d i.e., is the gospel\u201cscripture\u201d? And then Ignatius, like many another debater driven into a corner, takes refuge in rhetoric.\n\n\"But my archives are Jesus Christ; the inviolable archives are His cross, His death, His resurrection, and the faith which is exercised through Him. . . .46\"\n\nPlainly lgnatius regarded Jesus Christ as his \u201ctradition.\u201d Within that tradition everything had a place which bore true witness to Him: the Old Testament scriptures because they pointed forward to Him, the written gospel because it was the record of His incarnation and passion, the letters of the apostles because they were His delegates, and the church\u2019s faith and worship because they had their source in Him. Plainly, too, Ignatius had not thought his tradition through to first principles, so that he could give a logical defense of it in every part, including his recognition of the gospel as \u201cscripture.\u201d The earliest recognition of the New Testament writings was spontaneous and instinctive; the rationale of the canon came later. Hence the history of the canon at its outset has untidy edges; we cannot give a cut and dried account of its first formation any more than lgnatius or his contemporaries could have done.\n\nThe necessity of a canon of written documents as a check on the corruption of oral tradition was as apparent to many Gnostics as it was to those who maintained the tradition of the apostolic churches. Valentinus, according to Tertullian, used the whole New Testament canon,47\u00a0and the substantial truth of this statement has been confirmed in recent years by the evidence of Valentinian documents found among the Nag Hammadi papyri. The Gospel of Truth, for example, acknowledges the authority of every major section of the New Testament except the Pastoral Epistles.48\u00a0It was in their interpretation of the documents, not in their recognition of them, that the Valentinians were distinguished from the catholic church.49\n\nMarcion, for his part, also knew the value of an authoritative written canon and, strong in his cast-iron presuppositions, he promulgated his edition of the Euangelion and Apostolikon as (in his view) they must originally have been, thus creating a new tradition for his followers. The catholic leaders had an older tradition, but no doubt it was the promulgation of Marcion\u2019s canon that stimulated them, and especially the leaders of the Roman church, to define that tradition more precisely than they had thus far felt necessary. Whereas Marcion\u2019s canon expressed his exclusive devotion to Paul (Luke the evangelist enjoying special credit because of his association with Paul),50\u00a0the catholic canon was catholic in a further sense, comprising the writings of other apostles or \u201capostolic men\u201d alongside Paul, and of three other evangelists alongside Luke, and binding the Euangelion and Apostolikon together with Luke\u2019s second volume, henceforth called the Acts of the Apostles, which provided the sequel to the gospel story and the historical context of the apostolic letters, presenting independent evidence for the genuineness of Paul\u2019s apostolic claims51\u00a0and for the loyal witness of other apostles whom Marcion had denigrated. Acts was thus, as Harnack aptly put it, the \u201cpivot\u201d of the New Testament.52\n\nJustin Martyr attests the use of an informal New Testament canon; he tells how \u201cthe memoirs of the apostles,\u201d otherwise called \u201cgospels,\u201d were read in church in the same way as \u201cthe compositions of the prophets\u201d53\u00a0and quotes Old Testament texts together with passages from the writings of the new covenant (especially sayings of Jesus) as though they shared the same authority.54\u00a0If here and there his works contain traces of materials from the pseudonymous Gospels of Peter or Thomas, these are very few in comparison with his use of the fourfold Gospel.\n\nJustin\u2019s disciple Tatian is best known for his Diatessaron or Harmony of the four Gospels, which provides sufficient evidence of the separate level on which these four records were placed in his time. In places Tatian appears to have amplified the fourfold record by means of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which may have been a sectarian revision of Matthew but not to an extent which impairs the fourfold pattern of his Harmony.55\n\nFor Irenaeus, the fourfold Gospel is one of the facts of life, as axiomatic as the four pillars of the earth or the four winds of \u00a0heaven.56\u00a0This shows how thoroughly he and his contemporaries took it for granted that there were, and could be, only four gospel writings. Even more thoroughly did they take it for granted that these four could only be Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: this is something which, for them, did not even need to be proved. By the time of Irenaeus, too, the main contents of the catholic canon were fixed and accepted throughout the Christian world. He does not give us a formal list, but it is plain that for him the fourfold Gospel, Acts, the Pauline corpus, I Peter, I John, and Revelation were \u201cscripture\u201d (as also were I Clement and The Shepherd of Hermas).57\n\nThe earliest catholic list of New Testament books that has been preserved to us is that in the \u201cMuratorian\u201d canon, which probably represents the tradition of the Roman church at the end of the second century.58\u00a0The one surprise in this list is the omission of l Peter (this omission, in view of the corrupt state of the text in the only extant copy of the list, could conceivably be accidental).59\u00a0As it is, the list contains the four Gospels, Acts, the letters of Paul, Jude and John,60\u201cJohn\u2019s Apocalypse and Peter\u2018s,61\u201d with the Wisdom of Solomon.62\u00a0The Shepherd of Hermas, edifying as it is, is too recent to be reckoned canonical.63 The writings of the Valentinians, Marcionites, and Montanists are to be rejected.\n\nAs interesting as the contents of the list is the kind of argument put forward for the canonical acceptance of the various books. Luke was Paul\u2019s \u201clegal expert,\u201d an official who issued decrees and similar documents in accordance with his superior\u2019s judgement;64\u00a0thus Luke\u2019s writings are made to share Paul\u2019s authority. Luke\u2019s second volume is inappropriately called \u201cthe Acts of all the apostles\u201d possibly by way of anti-Marcionite emphasis but possibly also to make it clear that this was the only genuine book of apostolic Acts. In recent decades the five volumes of \u201cLeucian\u201d Acts had appeared-- of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas, and Paul65-- and the compiler of our list wishes it to be understood that it is to the canonical Acts, and not to these apocryphal works, that one must go in order to find an authentic record of the apostles\u2019 journeyings. Should anyone ask why Luke breaks off his narrative without tracing Paul\u2019s career to its end, the answer is that he narrated only those things which took place in his presence.66\u00a0This same insistence on eyewitness testimony --a further token of the author\u2019s acquaintance with Roman law --appears in his treatment of the Gospel of John, in which, he maintains, the Evangelist recorded only \u201cwhat we have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears and our hands have handled\u201d quoting I John l:l.\n\nWhen he comes to deal with the canonicity of Paul\u2019s letters, he makes the quite astonishing statement that Paul wrote letters to seven churches in accordance with the pattern set by John, who did the same in the Apocalypse. Presumably the canonicity of John\u2019s seven letters depended on his being a prophet, and the authority of Paul\u2019s letters was established by analogy with John\u2019s. 67\u00a0The same implication that prophecy is the main criterion of canonicity appears in his remark about The Shepherd of Hermas. This obviously could not be accepted as an apostolic writing, but its character would have qualified it for inclusion among the prophets, had the prophetic list not been closed long since.\n\nThe principal criterion of New Testament canonicity imposed in the early church was not prophetic inspiration but apostolic authorship or, if not authorship, then authority. In an environment where apostolic tradition counted for so much, the source and norm of that tradition were naturally found in the writings of apostles or of men closely associated with apostles. Mark and Luke, for instance, were known not to be apostles, but their close association with Peter and Paul6 8respectively was emphasized. As for the epistles, however, the tendency was for canonicity to be tied to the ascription of apostolic authorship. The Letter to the Hebrews, for example, was known in the Roman church earlier than anywhere else69\u00a0(so far as our evidence goes), but Rome was one of the last important churches to acknowledge it as canonical, just as Rome was one of the last important churches to ascribe Pauline authorship to it not out of conviction, but out of an unwillingness to be out of step in this regard with Alexandria and the other great eastern churches.\n\nThis unwillingness to be out of step with other churches reminds us that another criterion of canonicity was catholicity. A document which was acknowledged only in one small corner of Christendom was unlikely to win acceptance as canonical one which was acknowledged over the greater area of Christendom was likely to win still wider acceptance.\n\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries the definition of the New Testament canon continued to become more and more precise until in\u00a0367 Athanasius70\u00a0(followed by the Synod of Hippo in\u00a0393\u00a0and the Third Synod of Carthage in\u00a0397) listed as canonical the twenty-seven books which have been handed down to us. Until then it was customary to distinguish the (universally) acknowledged books and the disputed books, the spurious books (those laying false claim to apostolic authorship), and the heretical books which were erroneous and utterly to be repudiated. If a disputed book taught apostolic doctrine and was sufficiently ancient, it tended to be given the benefit of the doubt. The authorship of Jude, for example, was uncertain but, as Origen said, it was \u201cfull of words of heavenly grace\u201d72\u00a0and so it ultimately gained admission. The Shepherd of Hermas, on the other hand, popular as it was and recommended for reading in church, was known to be of post-apostolic origin and was so ruled out on the score of insufficient antiquity.73\n\nBut, as has already been said, these criteria of canonicity were largely devised to justify a tradition which already existed. Authority precedes canonicity that is to say, the various writings do not derive their authority from their inclusion in the canon, they were included in the canon because their authenticity was recognized.74\u00a0It is going too far to say, as Oscar Cullmann does, that \u201camong the early Christian writings the books which were to form the future canon forced themselves on tho Church by their intrinsic apostolic authority, as they do still, because the Kyrios Christ speaks in them\u201d75\u00a0- at least, if this is to be taken as a statement of history. \u201cIntrinsic apostolic authority\u201d is a difficult entity to define.\n\nWith our longer perspective we can say that the early church, in recognizing the books which make up the New Testament canon as uniquely worthy to stand alongside the sacred scriptures of the old covenant, was guided by a wisdom higher than its own. When we think of other early Christian documents more or less contemporary with the latest books of the New Testament --the Epistle of Clement of Rome, the Epistle of Barnabas, The Shepherd of Hermas, the Letters of lgnatius, and the Didache for example --we may be thankful that they did not succeed in gaining admission to the canon, although some of them were on the fringe of it for a considerable time. The question has been raised whether it is legitimate for us to defend the early church\u2019s decision about admission and exclusion with arguments quite different from those which were used at the time.76\u00a0But we have no option if we accept the canon we must defend our acceptance of it with arguments which we hold to be valid.\n\nThe Reformation And After\n\nAt the time of the Reformation, the canon of Scripture, like everything else that was handed down by tradition, was subjected to scrutiny. In many of the traditions handed down through medieval times, the Reformers recognized a close kinship to that \u201ctradition of men\u201d with which our Lord found fault because it displaced \u201cthe commandment of God.\u201d77\u00a0The danger of this tendency, said Calvin, lies in the fact that \u201cwhenever holiness is made to consist in anything else than in observing the law of God, men are led to believe that the law may be violated without danger.\u201d Then he adds \u201cLet any man now consider whether this wickedness does not at present abound more among the Papists than it formerly did among the Jews.\u201d78\u00a0And in many other places where the Gospels said \u201cPharisees\u201d the Reformers read \u201cPapists.\u201d Yet church tradition was not jettisoned completely by the mainstream Reformers; in doctrine and practice alike they went back beyond the Middle Ages to appeal to the fathers of the early centuries. Calvin himself was no mean patristic scholar and adduces patristic evidence freely and copiously in support of his arguments. But the fathers themselves were subject to the superior authority of Scripture. Calvin himself does not discuss the canon of the Scripture as distinct from its authority which he defends alike against those who in practice made it subordinate to church tradition and those who rejected it in favor of their private revelations.79\u00a0\u201cThose who are inwardly taught by the Holy Spirit acquiesce implicitly in Scripture. . . . Scripture, carrying its own evidence along with it, deigns not to submit to proofs and arguments, but owes the full conviction with which we ought to receive it to the testimony of the Spirit.\u201d80\u00a0He does not explicitly make the inward testimony of the Spirit a criterion of canonicity, but if the question had been directly put to him how he knew (say) that the Hebrew and Aramaic text of Daniel was Scripture whereas the additions in the Greek version were not, he might well have done so. The apostolicity of I I Peter is for him secondary,81\u00a0but \"it contains nothing unworthy of Peter, and.. . . shows throughout the power and grace of the apostolic spirit. . . . Certainly since the majesty of the Spirit of Christ expresses itself in all parts of the epistle, l have a dread of repudiating it, even though I do not recognize in it the genuine language of Peter.\u201d82\u00a0This is in effect, an appeal \u201d to the testimony of the Spirit for decision regarding a \"disputed\" book.83\n\nLuther expressed himself more freely, if less systematically.He translated the apocryphal books along with the Hebrew Bible, but gave them the same inferior rank as Jerome did. The same inferior rank, indeed, was given with emphasis to one of the books of the Hebrew Bible \u201cI hate Esther and II Maccabees so much \u201d he said,\u201c that I wish they did not exist. There is too much Judaism in them and much heathen vice.\u201d84\u00a0But within the New Testament also he assigned a lower rank to some books than to others. As is well known, in the list of books prefaced to his German New Testament he attaches serial numbers to the first \"twenty-three, which he calls elsewhere \u201cthe right certain capital books,\u201d85\u00a0and separates off the remaining four Hebrews, James Jude, and Revelation by a space and by the absence of serial numbers, In his prefaces to these books he indicates his reasons for relegating them to what was in essence deuterocanonical status. Hebrews, he reckoned, contained some \"wood, straw and hay\u201d along with the \u201cgold, silver and precious stones\" which were built into its fabric, and so it could not be placed on a level with the apostolic epistles.\u201d86James contradicted the doctrine of Justification by faith, and although it pressed home the \u2018law of God, it bore no evangelical witness to Christ.87\u00a0Jude, which he (mistakenly, no doubt) regarded as an abstract of ll Peter, was \"an unnecessary epistle to include among the capital books which ought to lay the foundation of faith\u201d; it was also held against it that it included uncanonical teaching and history (a reference to the Enoch quotation and the dispute about the body of Moses).88\u00a0Revelation \u201clacks everything that I hold as apostolic or prophetic\u201d89although the sharpness of this judgement, expressed in 1522, was subsequently mitigated.\n\nTo a large degree Luther\u2019s deuterocanonical books coincide with those which the early church ranked as disputed, but it was not the verdict of the early church that weighed with Luther so much as evangelical content. Therefore he had no difficulty about ll Peter or ll and lll John, although their apostolicity was questioned in the early church. The criterion of canonicity at least for protocanonicity, for inclusion among the \"capital books\"was for Luther \u201cwhat presses home Christ\" (was Christum treibet)90\u00a0Not the identity of the writer, but the character of the writing, is what counts. \u201cThat which does not teach Christ is not apostolic, even if Peter or Paul taught it. Again, that which does preach Christ is apostolic even if Judas, Annas, Pilate or Herod did it.\"91\u00a0In this Luther shows himself a true disciple of Paul: \u201ceven if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to You a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed\u201d (Gal\u00a01:8)\n\nLuther's criterion is still widely accepted. When Dr.Norman Snaith delivered his Fernley Hartley Lecture on the Distinctive Ideas of the Old Testament, he found that the distinctive ideas were those which were taken up and brought to perfection in the New Testament, not least in the letters of Paul, while \"the true development from Pauline theology is to be found in Luther and in John Wesley.92\u00a0Some readers might find it a surprising coincidence that the finest flowering of the biblical revelation should be discerned in the tradition of which Dr. Snaith is himself such a worthy and devoted exponent; but l have no doubt he is right --although too may not be entirely unbiased in this regard.\n\nQuite similar is the argument of the late Edward J. Carnell that, since Justification by faith is systematically expounded only in Romans and Galatians, \u201ctherefore, if the church teaches anything that offends the system of Romans and Galatians, it is cultic\"93\u00a0(\u201ccultic\u201d apparently having the sense of \u201csectarian\u201d as opposed to \u201ccatholic\u201d). Again \u201cwhenever a passage conflicts with teaching of Romans and Galatians, either the mind has failed to grasp its meaning, or the passage falls under the concept of progressive revelation.94\nThe Canon In The Twentieth Century\n\nBut we have received the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, and while individual readers or teachers may make distinctions between those among them which are \u201ccapital\u201d and those which are of lower grade, our church tradition has made no distinction since the end of the fourth century. The statement of Article Vl, that these twenty-seven are books of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church,\u201d is not true it we press our quest back earlier than that date, but from the on it represents the general consensus, if we overlook some of the separated eastern churches. lf, however, we are asked today why we accept these twenty-seven, or why we accept any specific one of them, do we give our tradition as a sufficient answer or do we seek an answer more satisfactory to ourselves and to our questioners?\n\nSome of us, theological students and the like, have studied the formation of the canon and can give a historical reason of sorts for our position. But what is the ordinary church member to say, especially if his church\u2019s formularies make no explicit statement about the canon? A Roman Catholic layman will appeal to the authority of the church, which has made clear pronouncements on this subject, but what does the ordinary free churchman say? Hardly, I suppose, \u201cBecause the church say so\u201d the only church he knows may be the local church to which he belongs, and it is unlikely ever to have made a pronouncement on the canon. Will he say, \u201cBecause my pastor says so, and he is a man of such piety and learning in fact, he is a B.A. (Theol.) of Manchester that he cannot be wrong\u201d? Perhaps; but what if his pastor voices doubts about the canonicity of Jude or the apostolicity of II Peter? He is then quite likely to say, \"My pastor, I fear, is a little unsound; he does not believe the whole Bible and that is the result of his attending those classes in Biblical Criticism at Manchester University.\u201d But how does he know what \u201cthe whole Bible\u201d is? Most probably by tradition sound and reliable tradition, no doubt, but tradition nonetheless.\n\nl turn now to a body of nineteenth-century origin unsurpassed in its professed adherence to sola scriptura and repudiation of the authority of tradition --the Exclusive Brethren-- and cite no unlearned church member but their ablest scholar, William Kelly. William Kelly was no mean theologian, but he would have been the last man to acknowledge any debt to \"mere\" tradition.95\u00a0Yet he \u201cwas the staunchest upholder of the entire Nicene and Athanasian doctrine,\u201d96\u00a0and to him the New Testament canon was a datum. ln his commentary on the Epistles of Peter, for example he notes the doubts that some had expressed in his day about authorship of II Peter, but he takes a short and sharp line with them.\n\nThe Petrine authorship and divine inspiration of II Peter as of l Peter, he says, is apprehended by \"any unbiased Christian\u201d97\u00a0which is a good example of the preemptive strike in theological controversy. He refuses to admit catholic tradition, as authority for the genuineness and canonicity of the document but with equal vigour he rejects the Protestant assertion of private judgement; both alike tend to the deification of man and the dethronernent of God. Perhaps he would have allowed the appeal to the inward witness of the Spirit, but he does not explicitly say so. What he does say is more peremptory and he says it in criticism of Bishop Christopher Wordsworth's argument that, in view of the many pseudepigrapha circulating in Peter's name it was the church\u2019s duty to suspend judgement on II Peter until adequate proofs of its authenticity were available.98\u201cIt is never a duty,\u201d says Kelly, \u201ceven for the simplest Christian, to doubt scripture, but only to believe.\u201d99\u00a0True but how is the simplest Christian to know in the first instance what is scripture and What is not? Kelly leaves this question unanswered, what is the more surprising in such an able thinker. Again, he may have held that the simplest Christian knows Scripture by the inward witness of the spirit but again, he does not explicity say so. Even so, the Spirit's inward witness may assure me that what I hear or read is the word of God to me; it will hardly give an answer to questions of authorship or date.\n\nIt is noteworthy that when it comes to textual criticism or straight exegesis, as distinct from the history of the canon, Kelly can use his private judgement in as sound and uninhibited a manner as any other scholar, though he is always apt, having established the true test or the proper exegesis on a grammaticohistorical basis, to turn his weapon round and say that any spiritual and unprejudiced reader can see that this is the right way of it.\n\nTo us the canon is something \u201creceived\u201d --the books \u201cdisputed by some\" being handed down with, and carried by, those \u201cacknowledged by all.\u201d100\u00a0Any talk of enlarging or contracting it at this time of day is unrealistic. We may toy with the fancy that some discovery to the future, like that of the Qumran or Nag Hammadi texts, may bring to light a lost letter of Paul\u2019s, say his \u201cprevious\u201d letter to the Corinthians101\u00a0- or a copy of the Gospel of Mark complete with its \u201clost\u201d ending(supposing that it was not the Evangelist\u2019s intention to finish at Mark 16:8). Would there be a move to have such a document added to the canon? It is difficult to see how this could be effected. For one thing, scholars would certainly not be unanimous about its authenticity. For another thing, there is no competent authority, acknowledged throughout Christendom, to decree its addition. Even if we could imagine the Pope, the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the presidents of the World Council of Churches and the International Council of Christian Churches agreeing to recommend the addition, there are some awkward nonconformists who would probably repudiate the idea just because it was recommended by one or all of these. If the analogy of history is relevant it suggests that the common consensus of Christians over several generations would have to precede any official pronouncement.\n\nSuggestions that the Canon might be augmented by the inclusion of other \u201cinspirational\" literature, ancient or mordern, arise from a failure to appreciate what the canon actually is. It is not an anthology of inspirational literature.The question is not what is to be read in church: when a sermon is read, the Congregation is treated to what is usually, in intention at least, inspirational literature, and the same may be said of prayers which are read from the prayer book or hymns which are read from the hymnbook. it is a question of getting as near as possible to the source of the Christian faith.\n\nIn a lecture delivered at Oxford in Professor Kurt Aland expressed this view that as the Old Testament canon underwent a de facto narrowing as a result of the new covenant established in Christ,102\u00a0so also the New Testament canon \"is in practice undergoing a narrowing and a shortening,\" so that we can recognize in the New Testament as in the Old a \"canon within the canon.\"103\u00a0This is a natural attitude on the part of a scholar in the Lutheran tradition; we know how depreciatory is the judgement passed today by many scholars in this tradition on those parts of the New Testament which smack of \u201cprimitive catholicism.\"104 The \u201cactual living, effective Canon,\u201d as distinct from the formal canon, \u201cis constructed according to the method of \u2018self-understanding.\u2019105\u00a0\u201c But if it is suggested that Christians and churches get together and try to reach agreement on a common effective canon, the difficulty is that the \u201ceffective\u201d canon of some groups or individuals differs from that of others. If the inner canon to some consists of Romans and Galatians (with the two Corinthian epistles), to others it consists of the Captivity Epistles, to others of the Synoptic Gospels, to others of the Johannine Gospels and Epistles, and to others (one might be tempted to think) of the Apocalypse.\n\nIt would be precarious to try to name any part of scripture --even the genealogical lists! --in which some believing reader has not heard the word of God addressing him effectively and in context. William Robertson Smith gave as his reason for believing in the Bible as the word of God \u201cBecause the Bible is the only record of the redeeming love of God, because in the Bible alone I find God drawing near to man in Christ Jesus, and declaring to us, in Him, His will for our salvation. And this record I know to be true by the witness of His Spirit in my heart, whereby I am assured that none other thank God Himself is abl;e to speak such words to my soul.\"106\u00a0If he had been asked just where in the Bible he recognized this record and experienced this witness, he would probably not have mentioned every book, but he might well have said that the record of God's love and the witness of the Spirit were so pervasive that they gave character to the Old and New Testament canon as a whole. Other readers might bear the same testimony, but might think of other parts of the Bible than Robertson Smith had in mind. No wonder, then, that Professor Aland speaks of the necessity of questioning one\u2019s own actual canon and taking the actual canon of others seriously.107\n\nThe appeal to the testimony of the Holy Spirit is valid, but it will scarcely enable all to decide the precise limits of the canon. By an act of faith one may identify the New Testament canon as we have received it with the entire paradosis of Christ to which in Oscar Cullmann\u2019s view, all the apostles contribute, each passing on to another that part which he himself received.108\u00a0This may be so, but it cannot be proved. It is better to say of the New Testament books what Hans Lietzmann said of the four Gospels in the early church, that \"the reference to their apostolic authority, which can only appear to us as a reminder of sound historical bases, had the deeper meaning that this particular tradition of Jesus and this alone had been established and guaranteed by the Holy Spirit working authoritatively in the Chruch.\"109\u00a0No doubt within \u201cthis particular tradition\u201d may be diverse strands of tradition indeed diverse traditions may be detected. But although critical scholars may emphasize their diversity, the church, both ancient and mordern, has been more conscious of their overall unity, in contrast to other interpretations which patently conflict with the New Testament witness but cannot substantiate a comparable claim to apostolic authority.\n\nIn the canon we have the foundation documents or the charter of the Christian faith. For no other document or group of documents from the earliest Christian generations can such a claim be made. (Even the most debatable of the \u201cdisputed\u201d books in the New Testament canon has more of the quality of apostolic authority about it than the letters of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch or The Shepherd of Hermas.) What has been said, however, is not tantamount to shutting the Holy Spirit up in a book or collection of books. Repeatedly, new movements the Spirit have been launched by a rediscovery of the living power which resides in the canon of Scripture. The New Testament \"not one of the paralysing and enslaving forces of the past, but it is full of eternal and present strength to make strong and to make free.\"[^110]\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1\u00a0Athanasius, Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter (see p. 65).

Tertullian, accepting an antediluvian date for I Enoch, and regarding Jude\u2019s quotation as lending authority to the book (since Jude is in his eyes an apostle), adds the further consideration that \"nothing which pertains to us must be rejected by us\" (On the Apparel of Women, 3).\n\n9\u00a0Not only the references to fallen angels in Jude 6 and ll Pet. 2:4 (cf. the \"spirits in prison\" of I Pet 3:19) i.e., to the trespassing \u201csons of God\u201d of Gen. 6:2, 4, on whose sin and penalty I Enoch enlarges but also the portrayal of the \"Son of Man\" in the independent section called the \"Similitudes of Enoch\" (Enoch 37-71); cf.

It is evident from Ecclus. 48:22-49:10 that Ben Sira knew all the \u201cLatter Prophets\u201d\u2014Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve-as canonical. In the first half of the first century A.D. Philo of Alexandria speaks of the Therapeutae as studying \u201claws, and oracles uttered through prophets, and hymns and the other things by which knowledge and piety are increased and brought to perfection\u201d (On the Contemplative Life, 25).\n\n17\u00a0This is the most natural inference from His language about \u201cthe blood of the all prophets shed from the foundation of the world . . . from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah\u201d (Luke 11:50f.) \u2014Zechariah being best identified with the martyred prophet of ll Chr. 24:20\u2014 22.\n\n18\u00a0\u201cThe upshot of their debates was that, in spite of objections, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles and Esther were acknowledged as canonical; Ecclesiasticus was not acknowledged (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 30b; Mishnah Yadaim 3:5; Bahylonian Talmud Megillah 7a; Palestinian Talmud Megillah 70a). The Jamnia debates \u201chave not so much dealt with the acceptance of certain writings into the Canon, but rather with their right to remain there\u201d (A. Bentzen, Introduction to the Old Testament i [Copenhagen, 1948], 31). There was some argument earlier in the school of Shammai about Ezekiel, long since included among the Prophets, but when an ingenious rabbi showed that he did not really contradict Moses, as had been alleged, misgivings were allayed (TB Shabbat 13b).\n\n19\u00a0Against Apion I. 37- 43. Since Josephus does not name the individual books,but classifies them in three groups of five, thirteen, and four respectively, wecannot say positively that his canon coincided precisely with that laid down at Jamnia, but if he reckoned Ruth as an appendix of Judges and Lamentations of Jeremiah, his total of twenty-two would correspond with the traditional twentyfour. Canonicity for him depends on prophetic inspiration, which dried up in the reign of Artaxerxes I: \u201cOur history has also been written in detail from Artaxerxes to our own times, but is not esteemed as of equal authority with the books already mentioned, because the exact succession of prophets failed.\u201d\n\n20\u00a0E.g., the utterance of \u201cthe Wisdom of God\u201d in Luke 11:49; the passage\nbeginning \u201cWhat no eye has seen . . .\u201d in I Cor. 2:9 and the \u201cscripture\u201d quoted\nin James 4:5.\n\n21\u00a0See p. 61.\n\n22\u00a0\u201cJude 9; cf.

There may be allusions to Wisdom in Rom. 1:18-2:16, but if so they express dissent as well as assent. The martyrs of the Maccabaean struggle (cf. II Mace. 6- 7) are probably in view in Heb. 11:35b- 38, the author of which indeed was probably acquainted with IV Maccabees, but IV Maccabees was never accounted a canonical book. If the argument from silence is pressed, it shotuld be realized that one could apply it to Canticles and Esther, which are not quoted in the New Testament (there may be allusions to Ecclesiates in Rom 8:20 and I Cor. 15:32).\n\n24\u00a0Quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. IV.26.l4.\n\n25\u00a0See p. 61. One objection to the canonical acceptance of Esther was the factthat the name of God makes no appearance in it; another (voiced naturally among Jews rather than among Christians) was its record of the institution of a new festival (Purim), which conflicted with the view that all the festivals were instituted by Moses. Lamentations and Nehemiah are not specifically mentioned by Melito, but they may have been included with Jeremiah and Ezra respectively.\n\n26\u00a0Cf. J. P. Audet, \u201cA Hebrew-Aramaic List of Books of the Old Testament in 5 Greek,\u201d JTS, NS I (1950), l35ff. Lamentations is not mentioned by name but may have been counted as an appendix to Jeremiah. This list makes the total twenty-seven.\n\n27\u00a0Quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. VI.25.2. Origen\u2019s total, like Josephus\u2019s, is twenty-two.\n\n28\u00a0Athanasius, Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter. His total also is twenty-two.

The adjective \u201capocryphal\u201d (Gk.,\n\u201chidden\u201d) had previously been used to denote books which were esoteric in content or withdrawn from general reading (cf. II Esdras l4:46f.); Jerome uses it of those hooks which other church fathers called \u201cecclesiastical\u201d (i.e., suitable for reading publicly in church).\n\n30\u00a0\u201cPrologue to books of Solomon. This is the passage referred to in Article VI: \u201cAnd the other books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life, and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine.\u201d\n\n31\u00a0\u201cAugustine points out that the books of the Maccabees (and others) \u201care held as canonical not by the Jews but by the church\u201d (City of God xviii. 36). He further explains that books like I Enoch have no place in the canon \u201cbecause their antiquity brought them under suspicion, and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were his [Enoch\u2019s] genuine writings\u201d (City of God xv. 23; cf. xviii. 38)\n\n32\u00a0\u201cThe distinction between the Apocrypha and the books contained in the Hebrew Bible was preserved by some medieval scholars, especially those who\nknew Hebrew or at least paid attention to Jerome. Thus Hugh of St.-Victor (died\nc. 1141) in a chapter De numero librorum sacri eloquii enumerates the books of the Hebrew Bible and adds: \u201cThere are also in the Old Testament certain other\nbooks which are indeed read [i.e., in church] but are not inscribed in the body\nof the text or in the canon of authority: such are the books of Tobit, Judith and\nthe Maccabees, the so-called Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus\u201d\n(De Sacramentis I, Prologue, chap. 7: Patrologia Latina 176, cols. 185- I86 D).\n\n33\u00a0\u201cRichard Hooker defends the Anglican attitude in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, Vol. V (London, 1597), p. 20.\n\n34\u00a0\u201cSessio IV, Decretum de canonicis scripturis.

(The Eastern Church confirmed the canonicity\nof the apocryphal books included in the Septuagint in l642 and 1672.)\n\n35\u00a0Westminster Confession of Faith I, 3. The word \u201cultimately\u201d is used deliberately: earlier representatives of the Geneva tradition are not so uncompromising. Coverdale (1535), who first gathered the apocryphal books together as an appendix to the Old Testament, says he did so because \u201cthere be many places in them, that seme to be repugnaunt vnto the open and manyfest trueth in the other bokes of the byble,\u201d yet will not \u201chaue them despysed, or little sett by\u201d because if they are read in the light of the canonical books \u201cthey shulde nether seme contrary, ner be vntruly & peruersly alledged.\u201d The Geneva Bible (1560), following Jerome, says that \u201cas bokes proceding from godlie men\u201d they \u201cwere receiued to be red for the aduancement and furtherance of the knowledge of the historic, & for the instruction of godlie maners: which bokes declare that at all times God had an especial care of his Church and left them not vtterly destitute of teachers and meanes to confirme them in the hope of the promised Messiah, and also witnesse that those calamities that God sent to his Church, were according to his prouidence, who had bothe so threatened by his Prophetes, and so broght it to passe for the destruction of their enemies, and for the tryal of his children.\u201d\n\n36\u00a0\u201cDogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith: chap. 2, \u201cOf Revelation.\u201d Vatican II does not go into detail about the Old Testament canon.\n\n37\u00a0Cf.

There is also another epistle of Peter, which some of our people refuse to have read in church\u201d (Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons ii [Erlangen, 1890], p. 142; the italicized words are supplied by Zahn).\n\n60\u00a0Two by the aforementioned John,\u201d says the list: if this means two in addition to I John, mentioned some lines earlier in connexion with the Gospel of\nJohn, these two will be our ll and lll john; otherwise we should have to conclude\neither that only one of the two shorter letters of John was included, or else that\nll and lll John were reckoned together as one.\n\n61\u00a0The Apocalypse of Peter has been preserved (cf. New Testament Apocrypha,\ned. E. Hennecke, W. Schneemelcher, R. McL. Wilson [ET London, 1965], pp. 663- 683); its lurid pictures of the torments of the damned are the source of much medieval imagery, e.g., of their portrayal in Dante\u2019s Inferno.\n\n62\u00a0We associate Wisdom with the Old Testament Apocrypha rather than with\nthe New Testament, but in date it is closer to the New Testament than to the Old\n\n63\u00a0Hermas is said to have been the brother of Pius I, bishop of Rome e. A.D. l50. He may have been an older brother, as the date of The Shepherd of Hermas is probably nearer the beginning of the second century than the middle.\n\n64\u00a0Cf. A. Ehrhardt, The Framework of the New Testament Stories (Manchester, 1964), pp. 16ff.; he deduces from the technical language of Roman law used here that the document must have been composed at Rome, and in Latin, perhaps under Pope Zephyrinus (197 - 217).\n\n65\u00a0Cf. New Testament Apocrypha, ed. E. Hennecke, W. Schneemelcher, R.McL. Wilson, pp. 167-531.\n\n65\u00a0Two events are mentioned as unrelated by Luke for this reason Paul\u2019s\ndeparture for Spain and Peter\u2019s execution in Rome.

Snyder (New York, 1962), pp. 239ff.\n\n68\u00a0Eusebius mentions some who went so far as to suggest that, when Paul\nspeaks of \u201cmy gospel\u201d (Rom. 2:16; 16:25; II Tim. 2:8), he refers to the Gospel of\nLuke (Hist. Eccl. III.4.7).\n\n69\u00a0Clement of Rome (c. A.D. 96) knows the letter and quotes it-misinterpreting it in one place (I Clem. 17:1) where he takes those who \u201cwent about in skins of sheep and goats\u201d (Heb. 11:37) to be Elijah and Elisha\u2014but he gives no inkling of its authorship nor does he treat it as an apostolic document.\n\n70\u00a0Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter (see p. 65). Athanasius includes the Didache and The Shepherd of Hermas along with five of the Old Testament apocrypha as read in church but not canonical.\n\n71\u00a0Thus the Gospel of Peter was allowed to be read in the church of Rhossus in Syria, until Sepapion, bishop of Antioch, discovered its Docetic tendency and put them on their guard against it (Eusebius, Hist Eccl. VI.12.2ff.).\n\n72\u00a0Origen, Commentary on Matthew x. 17 (on Matt.13:55).\n\n73\u00a0There were also practical considerations which made the contents of the canon better known among the rank and file of Christians; it was important for\nto know which books might be appealed to in disputes with heretics and (in the last imperial persecution) which books might be handed over to the police .,for:}\u200bglestruction and_which must be guarded at the cost of one\u2019s life, if necessary.\n\n74\u00a0Of course their authority came to be recognized in a practical way from their presence in the canon, but this is a ratio cognoscendi, not the ratio essendi.\n\n75\u00a0O.

strangers around\nSet my phaser to kill, my force field is on max\nNever relax, study the facts and stockpile gats\nCause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds\nThis gas mask's in my

Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride\nNocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights\nOne shot at glory, game will never give you three tries\nFor the haters I've murked, they would love to see me

We did not, then, know that we were only looking at the fag end of the masks, who were driving slowly round and round the Piazza until they could find a promising opportunity for falling into the stream of carriages, and getting, in good time, into the thick of the festivity; and coming among them so abruptly, all travel-stained and weary, was not coming very well prepared to enjoy the scene.\n\nWe had crossed the Tiber by the Ponte Molle two or three miles before.  It had looked as yellow as it ought to look, and hurrying on between its worn-away and miry banks, had a promising aspect of desolation and ruin.  The masquerade dresses on the fringe of the Carnival, did great violence to this promise.  There were no great ruins, no solemn tokens of antiquity, to be seen;\u2014they all lie on the other side of the city.  There seemed to be long streets of commonplace shops and houses, such as are to be found in any European town; there were busy people, equipages, ordinary walkers to and fro; a multitude of chattering strangers.  It was no more my Rome: the Rome of anybody\u2019s fancy, man or boy; degraded and fallen and lying asleep in the sun among a heap of ruins: than the Place de la Concorde in Paris is.  A cloudy sky, a dull cold rain, and muddy streets, I was prepared for, but not for this: and I confess to having gone to bed, that night, in a very indifferent humour, and with a very considerably quenched enthusiasm.\n\nImmediately on going out next day, we hurried off to St. Peter\u2019s.  It looked immense in the distance, but distinctly and decidedly small, by comparison, on a near approach.  The beauty of the Piazza, on which it stands, with its clusters of exquisite columns, and its gushing fountains\u2014so fresh, so broad, and free, and beautiful\u2014nothing can exaggerate.  The first burst of the interior, in all its expansive majesty and glory: and, most of all, the looking up into the Dome: is a sensation never to be forgotten.  But, there were preparations for a Festa; the pillars of stately marble were swathed in some impertinent frippery of red and yellow; the altar, and entrance to the subterranean chapel: which is before it: in the centre of the church: were like a goldsmith\u2019s shop, or one of the opening scenes in a very lavish pantomime.  And though I had as high a sense of the beauty of the building (I hope) as it is possible to entertain, I felt no very strong emotion.  I have been infinitely more affected in many English cathedrals when the organ has been playing, and in many English country churches when the congregation have been singing.  I had a much greater sense of mystery and wonder, in the Cathedral of San Mark at Venice.\n\nWhen we came out of the church again (we stood nearly an hour staring up into the dome: and would not have \u2018gone over\u2019 the Cathedral then, for any money), we said to the coachman, \u2018Go to the Coliseum.\u2019  In a quarter of an hour or so, he stopped at the gate, and we went in.\n\nIt is no fiction, but plain, sober, honest Truth, to say: so suggestive and distinct is it at this hour: that, for a moment\u2014actually in passing in\u2014they who will, may have the whole great pile before them, as it used to be, with thousands of eager faces staring down into the arena, and such a whirl of strife, and blood, and dust going on there, as no language can describe.  Its solitude, its awful beauty, and its utter desolation, strike upon the stranger the next moment, like a softened sorrow; and never in his life, perhaps, will he be so moved and overcome by any sight, not immediately connected with his own affections and afflictions.\n\nTo see it crumbling there, an inch a year; its walls and arches overgrown with green; its corridors open to the day; the long grass growing in its porches; young trees of yesterday, springing up on its ragged parapets, and bearing fruit: chance produce of the seeds dropped there by the birds who build their nests within its chinks and crannies; to see its Pit of Fight filled up with earth, and the peaceful Cross planted in the centre; to climb into its upper halls, and look down on ruin, ruin, ruin, all about it; the triumphal arches of Constantine, Septimus Severus, and Titus; the Roman Forum; the Palace of the C\u00e6sars; the temples of the old religion, fallen down and gone; is to see the ghost of old Rome, wicked, wonderful old city, haunting the very ground on which its people trod.  It is the most impressive, the most stately, the most solemn, grand, majestic, mournful sight, conceivable.  Never, in its bloodiest prime, can the sight of the gigantic Coliseum, full and running over with the lustiest life, have moved one\u2019s heart, as it must move all who look upon it now, a ruin.  God be thanked: a ruin!\n\nAs it tops the other ruins: standing there, a mountain among graves: so do its ancient influences outlive all other remnants of the old mythology and old butchery of Rome, in the nature of the fierce and cruel Roman people.  The Italian face changes as the visitor approaches the city; its beauty becomes devilish; and there is scarcely one countenance in a hundred, among the common people in the streets, that would not be at home and happy in a renovated Coliseum to-morrow.\n\nHere was Rome indeed at last; and such a Rome as no one can imagine in its full and awful grandeur!  We wandered out upon the Appian Way, and then went on, through miles of ruined tombs and broken walls, with here and there a desolate and uninhabited house: past the Circus of Romulus, where the course of the chariots, the stations of the judges, competitors, and spectators, are yet as plainly to be seen as in old time: past the tomb of Cecilia Metella: past all inclosure, hedge, or stake, wall or fence: away upon the open Campagna, where on that side of Rome, nothing is to be beheld but Ruin.  Except where the distant Apennines bound the view upon the left, the whole wide prospect is one field of ruin.  Broken aqueducts, left in the most picturesque and beautiful clusters of arches; broken temples; broken tombs.  A desert of decay, sombre and desolate beyond all expression; and with a history in every stone that strews the ground.\n\n\nOn Sunday, the Pope assisted in the performance of High Mass at St. Peter\u2019s.  The effect of the Cathedral on my mind, on that second visit, was exactly what it was at first, and what it remains after many visits.  It is not religiously impressive or affecting.  It is an immense edifice, with no one point for the mind to rest upon; and it tires itself with wandering round and round.  The very purpose of the place, is not expressed in anything you see there, unless you examine its details\u2014and all examination of details is incompatible with the place itself.  It might be a Pantheon, or a Senate House, or a great architectural trophy, having no other object than an architectural triumph.  There is a black statue of St. Peter, to be sure, under a red canopy; which is larger than life and which is constantly having its great toe kissed by good Catholics.  You cannot help seeing that: it is so very prominent and popular.  But it does not heighten the effect of the temple, as a work of art; and it is not expressive\u2014to me at least\u2014of its high purpose.\n\nA large space behind the altar, was fitted up with boxes, shaped like those at the Italian Opera in England, but in their decoration much more gaudy.  In the centre of the kind of theatre thus railed off, was a canopied dais with the Pope\u2019s chair upon it.  The pavement was covered with a carpet of the brightest green; and what with this green, and the intolerable reds and crimsons, and gold borders of the hangings, the whole concern looked like a stupendous Bonbon.  On either side of the altar, was a large box for lady strangers.  These were filled with ladies in black dresses and black veils.  The gentlemen of the Pope\u2019s guard, in red coats, leather breeches, and jack-boots, guarded all this reserved space, with drawn swords that were very flashy in every sense; and from the altar all down the nave, a broad lane was kept clear by the Pope\u2019s Swiss guard, who wear a quaint striped surcoat, and striped tight legs, and carry halberds like those which are usually shouldered by those theatrical supernumeraries, who never can get off the stage fast enough, and who may be generally observed to linger in the enemy\u2019s camp after the open country, held by the opposite forces, has been split up the middle by a convulsion of Nature.\n\nI got upon the border of the green carpet, in company with a great many other gentlemen, attired in black (no other passport is necessary), and stood there at my ease, during the performance of Mass.  The singers were in a crib of wirework (like a large meat-safe or bird-cage) in one corner; and sang most atrociously.  All about the green carpet, there was a slowly moving crowd of people: talking to each other: staring at the Pope through eye-glasses; defrauding one another, in moments of partial curiosity, out of precarious seats on the bases of pillars: and grinning hideously at the ladies.  Dotted here and there, were little knots of friars (Frances-c\u00e1ni, or Cappucc\u00edni, in their coarse brown dresses and peaked hoods) making a strange contrast to the gaudy ecclesiastics of higher degree, and having their humility gratified to the utmost, by being shouldered about, and elbowed right and left, on all sides.  Some of these had muddy sandals and umbrellas, and stained garments: having trudged in from the country.  The faces of the greater part were as coarse and heavy as their dress; their dogged, stupid, monotonous stare at all the glory and splendour, having something in it, half miserable, and half ridiculous.\n\nUpon the green carpet itself, and gathered round the altar, was a perfect army of cardinals and priests, in red, gold, purple, violet, white, and fine linen.  Stragglers from these, went to and fro among the crowd, conversing two and two, or giving and receiving introductions, and exchanging salutations; other functionaries in black gowns, and other functionaries in court-dresses, were similarly engaged.  In the midst of all these, and stealthy Jesuits creeping in and out, and the extreme restlessness of the Youth of England, who were perpetually wandering about, some few steady persons in black cassocks, who had knelt down with their faces to the wall, and were poring over their missals, became, unintentionally, a sort of humane man-traps, and with their own devout legs, tripped up other people\u2019s by the dozen.\n\nThere was a great pile of candles lying down on the floor near me, which a very old man in a rusty black gown with an open-work tippet, like a summer ornament for a fireplace in tissue-paper, made himself very busy in dispensing to all the ecclesiastics: one a-piece.  They loitered about with these for some time, under their arms like walking-sticks, or in their hands like truncheons.  At a certain period of the ceremony, however, each carried his candle up to the Pope, laid it across his two knees to be blessed, took it back again, and filed off.  This was done in a very attenuated procession, as you may suppose, and occupied a long time.  Not because it takes long to bless a candle through and through, but because there were so many candles to be blessed.  At last they were all blessed: and then they were all lighted; and then the Pope was taken up, chair and all, and carried round the church.\n\nI must say, that I never saw anything, out of November, so like the popular English commemoration of the fifth of that month.  A bundle of matches and a lantern, would have made it perfect.  Nor did the Pope, himself, at all mar the resemblance, though he has a pleasant and venerable face; for, as this part of the ceremony makes him giddy and sick, he shuts his eyes when it is performed: and having his eyes shut and a great mitre on his head, and his head itself wagging to and fro as they shook him in carrying, he looked as if his mask were going to tumble off.  The two immense fans which are always borne, one on either side of him, accompanied him, of course, on this occasion.  As they carried him along, he blessed the people with the mystic sign; and as he passed them, they kneeled down.  When he had made the round of the church, he was brought back again, and if I am not mistaken, this performance was repeated, in the whole, three times.  There was, certainly nothing solemn or effective in it; and certainly very much that was droll and tawdry.  But this remark applies to the whole ceremony, except the raising of the Host, when every man in the guard dropped on one knee instantly, and dashed his naked sword on the ground; which had a fine effect.\n\nThe next time I saw the cathedral, was some two or three weeks afterwards, when I climbed up into the ball; and then, the hangings being taken down, and the carpet taken up, but all the framework left, the remnants of these decorations looked like an exploded cracker.\n\n\nThe Friday and Saturday having been solemn Festa days, and Sunday being always a dies non in carnival proceedings, we had looked forward, with some impatience and curiosity, to the beginning of the new week: Monday and Tuesday being the two last and best days of the Carnival.\n\nOn the Monday afternoon at one or two o\u2019clock, there began to be a great rattling of carriages into the court-yard of the hotel; a hurrying to and fro of all the servants in it; and, now and then, a swift shooting across some doorway or balcony, of a straggling stranger in a fancy dress: not yet sufficiently well used to the same, to wear it with confidence, and defy public opinion.  All the carriages were open, and had the linings carefully covered with white cotton or calico, to prevent their proper decorations from being spoiled by the incessant pelting of sugar-plums; and people were packing and cramming into every vehicle as it waited for its occupants, enormous sacks and baskets full of these conf\u00e9tti, together with such heaps of flowers, tied up in little nosegays, that some carriages were not only brimful of flowers, but literally running over: scattering, at every shake and jerk of the springs, some of their abundance on the ground.  Not to be behindhand in these essential particulars, we caused two very respectable sacks of sugar-plums (each about three feet high) and a large clothes-basket full of flowers to be conveyed into our hired barouche, with all speed.  And from our place of observation, in one of the upper balconies of the hotel, we contemplated these arrangements with the liveliest satisfaction.  The carriages now beginning to take up their company, and move away, we got into ours, and drove off too, armed with little wire masks for our faces; the sugar-plums, like Falstaff\u2019s adulterated sack, having lime in their composition.\n\nThe Corso is a street a mile long; a street of shops, and palaces, and private houses, sometimes opening into a broad piazza.  There are verandahs and balconies, of all shapes and sizes, to almost every house\u2014not on one story alone, but often to one room or another on every story\u2014put there in general with so little order or regularity, that if, year after year, and season after season, it had rained balconies, hailed balconies, snowed balconies, blown balconies, they could scarcely have come into existence in a more disorderly manner.\n\nThis is the great fountain-head and focus of the Carnival.  But all the streets in which the Carnival is held, being vigilantly kept by dragoons, it is necessary for carriages, in the first instance, to pass, in line, down another thoroughfare, and so come into the Corso at the end remote from the Pi\u00e1zza del Popolo; which is one of its terminations.  Accordingly, we fell into the string of coaches, and, for some time, jogged on quietly enough; now crawling on at a very slow walk; now trotting half-a-dozen yards; now backing fifty; and now stopping altogether: as the pressure in front obliged us.  If any impetuous carriage dashed out of the rank and clattered forward, with the wild idea of getting on faster, it was suddenly met, or overtaken, by a trooper on horseback, who, deaf as his own drawn sword to all remonstrances, immediately escorted it back to the very end of the row, and made it a dim speck in the remotest perspective.  Occasionally, we interchanged a volley of conf\u00e9tti with the carriage next in front, or the carriage next behind; but as yet, this capturing of stray and errant coaches by the military, was the chief amusement.\n\nPresently, we came into a narrow street, where, besides one line of carriages going, there was another line of carriages returning.  Here the sugar-plums and the nosegays began to fly about, pretty smartly; and I was fortunate enough to observe one gentleman attired as a Greek warrior, catch a light-whiskered brigand on the nose (he was in the very act of tossing up a bouquet to a young lady in a first-floor window) with a precision that was much applauded by the bystanders.  As this victorious Greek was exchanging a facetious remark with a stout gentleman in a doorway\u2014one-half black and one-half white, as if he had been peeled up the middle\u2014who had offered him his congratulations on this achievement, he received an orange from a housetop, full on his left ear, and was much surprised, not to say discomfited.  Especially, as he was standing up at the time; and in consequence of the carriage moving on suddenly, at the same moment, staggered ignominiously, and buried himself among his flowers.\n\nSome quarter of an hour of this sort of progress, brought us to the Corso; and anything so gay, so bright, and lively as the whole scene there, it would be difficult to imagine.  From all the innumerable balconies: from the remotest and highest, no less than from the lowest and nearest: hangings of bright red, bright green, bright blue, white and gold, were fluttering in the brilliant sunlight.  From windows, and from parapets, and tops of houses, streamers of the richest colours, and draperies of the gaudiest and most sparkling hues, were floating out upon the street.  The buildings seemed to have been literally turned inside out, and to have all their gaiety towards the highway.  Shop-fronts were taken down, and the windows filled with company, like boxes at a shining theatre; doors were carried off their hinges, and long tapestried groves, hung with garlands of flowers and evergreens, displayed within; builders\u2019 scaffoldings were gorgeous temples, radiant in silver, gold, and crimson; and in every nook and corner, from the pavement to the chimney-tops, where women\u2019s eyes could glisten, there they danced, and laughed, and sparkled, like the light in water.  Every sort of bewitching madness of dress was there.  Little preposterous scarlet jackets; quaint old stomachers, more wicked than the smartest bodices; Polish pelisses, strained and tight as ripe gooseberries; tiny Greek caps, all awry, and clinging to the dark hair, Heaven knows how; every wild, quaint, bold, shy, pettish, madcap fancy had its illustration in a dress; and every fancy was as dead forgotten by its owner, in the tumult of merriment, as if the three old aqueducts that still remain entire had brought Lethe into Rome, upon their sturdy arches, that morning.\n\nThe carriages were now three abreast; in broader places four; often stationary for a long time together, always one close mass of variegated brightness; showing, the whole street-full, through the storm of flowers, like flowers of a larger growth themselves.  In some, the horses were richly caparisoned in magnificent trappings; in others they were decked from head to tail, with flowing ribbons.  Some were driven by coachmen with enormous double faces: one face leering at the horses: the other cocking its extraordinary eyes into the carriage: and both rattling again, under the hail of sugar-plums.  Other drivers were attired as women, wearing long ringlets and no bonnets, and looking more ridiculous in any real difficulty with the horses (of which, in such a concourse, there were a great many) than tongue can tell, or pen describe.  Instead of sitting in the carriages, upon the seats, the handsome Roman women, to see and to be seen the better, sit in the heads of the barouches, at this time of general licence, with their feet upon the cushions\u2014and oh, the flowing skirts and dainty waists, the blessed shapes and laughing faces, the free, good-humoured, gallant figures that they make! There were great vans, too, full of handsome girls\u2014thirty, or more together, perhaps\u2014and the broadsides that were poured into, and poured out of, these fairy fire-shops, splashed the air with flowers and bon-bons for ten minutes at a time.  Carriages, delayed long in one place, would begin a deliberate engagement with other carriages, or with people at the lower windows; and the spectators at some upper balcony or window, joining in the fray, and attacking both parties, would empty down great bags of conf\u00e9tti, that descended like a cloud, and in an instant made them white as millers.  Still, carriages on carriages, dresses on dresses, colours on colours, crowds upon crowds, without end.  Men and boys clinging to the wheels of coaches, and holding on behind, and following in their wake, and diving in among the horses\u2019 feet to pick up scattered flowers to sell again; maskers on foot (the drollest generally) in fantastic exaggerations of court-dresses, surveying the throng through enormous eye-glasses, and always transported with an ecstasy of love, on the discovery of any particularly old lady at a window; long strings of Policinelli, laying about them with blown bladders at the ends of sticks; a waggon-full of madmen, screaming and tearing to the life; a coach-full of grave mamelukes, with their horse-tail standard set up in the midst; a party of gipsy-women engaged in terrific conflict with a shipful of sailors; a man-monkey on a pole, surrounded by strange animals with pigs\u2019 faces, and lions\u2019 tails, carried under their arms, or worn gracefully over their shoulders; carriages on carriages, dresses on dresses, colours on colours, crowds upon crowds, without end.  Not many actual characters sustained, or represented, perhaps, considering the number dressed, but the main pleasure of the scene consisting in its perfect good temper; in its bright, and infinite, and flashing variety; and in its entire abandonment to the mad humour of the time\u2014an abandonment so perfect, so contagious, so irresistible, that the steadiest foreigner fights up to his middle in flowers and sugar-plums, like the wildest Roman of them all, and thinks of nothing else till half-past four o\u2019clock, when he is suddenly reminded (to his great regret) that this is not the whole business of his existence, by hearing the trumpets sound, and seeing the dragoons begin to clear the street.\n\nHow it ever is cleared for the race that takes place at five, or how the horses ever go through the race, without going over the people, is more than I can say.  But the carriages get out into the by-streets, or up into the Pi\u00e1zza del Popolo, and some people sit in temporary galleries in the latter place, and tens of thousands line the Corso on both sides, when the horses are brought out into the Pi\u00e1zza\u2014to the foot of that same column which, for centuries, looked down upon the games and chariot-races in the Circus Maximus.\n\nAt a given signal they are started off.  Down the live lane, the whole length of the Corso, they fly like the wind: riderless, as all the world knows: with shining ornaments upon their backs, and twisted in their plaited manes: and with heavy little balls stuck full of spikes, dangling at their sides, to goad them on.  The jingling of these trappings, and the rattling of their hoofs upon the hard stones; the dash and fury of their speed along the echoing street; nay, the very cannon that are fired\u2014these noises are nothing to the roaring of the multitude: their shouts: the clapping of their hands.  But it is soon over\u2014almost instantaneously.  More cannon shake the town.  The horses have plunged into the carpets put across the street to stop them; the goal is reached; the prizes are won (they are given, in part, by the poor Jews, as a compromise for not running foot-races themselves); and there is an end to that day\u2019s sport.\n\nBut if the scene be bright, and gay, and crowded, on the last day but one, it attains, on the concluding day, to such a height of glittering colour, swarming life, and frolicsome uproar, that the bare recollection of it makes me giddy at this moment.  The same diversions, greatly heightened and intensified in the ardour with which they are pursued, go on until the same hour.  The race is repeated; the cannon are fired; the shouting and clapping of hands are renewed; the cannon are fired again; the race is over; and the prizes are won.  But the carriages: ankle-deep with sugar-plums within, and so be-flowered and dusty without, as to be hardly recognisable for the same vehicles that they were, three hours ago: instead of scampering off in all directions, throng into the Corso, where they are soon wedged together in a scarcely moving mass.  For the diversion of the Moccoletti, the last gay madness of the Carnival, is now at hand; and sellers of little tapers like what are called Christmas candles in England, are shouting lustily on every side, \u2018Moccoli, Moccoli!  Ecco Moccoli!\u2019\u2014a new item in the tumult; quite abolishing that other item of \u2018Ecco Fi\u00f3ri!  Ecco Fior-r-r!\u2019 which has been making itself audible over all the rest, at intervals, the whole day through.\n\nAs the bright hangings and dresses are all fading into one dull, heavy, uniform colour in the decline of the day, lights begin flashing, here and there: in the windows, on the housetops, in the balconies, in the carriages, in the hands of the foot-passengers: little by little: gradually, gradually: more and more: until the whole long street is one great glare and blaze of fire.  Then, everybody present has but one engrossing object; that is, to extinguish other people\u2019s candles, and to keep his own alight; and everybody: man, woman, or child, gentleman or lady, prince or peasant, native or foreigner: yells and screams, and roars incessantly, as a taunt to the subdued, \u2018Senza Moccolo, Senza Moccolo!\u2019  (Without a light!  Without a light!) until nothing is heard but a gigantic chorus of those two words, mingled with peals of laughter.\n\nThe spectacle, at this time, is one of the most extraordinary that can be imagined.  Carriages coming slowly by, with everybody standing on the seats or on the box, holding up their lights at arms\u2019 length, for greater safety; some in paper shades; some with a bunch of undefended little tapers, kindled altogether; some with blazing torches; some with feeble little candles; men on foot, creeping along, among the wheels, watching their opportunity, to make a spring at some particular light, and dash it out; other people climbing up into carriages, to get hold of them by main force; others, chasing some unlucky wanderer, round and round his own coach, to blow out the light he has begged or stolen somewhere, before he can ascend to his own company, and enable them to light their extinguished tapers; others, with their hats off, at a carriage-door, humbly beseeching some kind-hearted lady to oblige them with a light for a cigar, and when she is in the fulness of doubt whether to comply or no, blowing out the candle she is guarding so tenderly with her little hand; other people at the windows, fishing for candles with lines and hooks, or letting down long willow-wands with handkerchiefs at the end, and flapping them out, dexterously, when the bearer is at the height of his triumph, others, biding their time in corners, with immense extinguishers like halberds, and suddenly coming down upon glorious torches; others, gathered round one coach, and sticking to it; others, raining oranges and nosegays at an obdurate little lantern, or regularly storming a pyramid of men, holding up one man among them, who carries one feeble little wick above his head, with which he defies them all!  Senza Moccolo!  Senza Moccolo!  Beautiful women, standing up in coaches, pointing in derision at extinguished lights, and clapping their hands, as they pass on, crying, \u2018Senza Moccolo!  Senza Moccolo!\u2019; low balconies full of lovely faces and gay dresses, struggling with assailants in the streets; some repressing them as they climb up, some bending down, some leaning over, some shrinking back\u2014delicate arms and bosoms\u2014graceful figures\u2014glowing lights, fluttering dresses, Senza Moccolo, Senza Moccoli, Senza Moc-co-lo-o-o-o!\u2014when in the wildest enthusiasm of the cry, and fullest ecstasy of the sport, the Ave Maria rings from the church steeples, and the Carnival is over in an instant\u2014put out like a taper, with a breath!\n\nThere was a masquerade at the theatre at night, as dull and senseless as a London one, and only remarkable for the summary way in which the house was cleared at eleven o\u2019clock: which was done by a line of soldiers forming along the wall, at the back of the stage, and sweeping the whole company out before them, like a broad broom.  The game of the Moccoletti (the word, in the singular, Moccoletto, is the diminutive of Moccolo, and means a little lamp or candlesnuff) is supposed by some to be a ceremony of burlesque mourning for the death of the Carnival: candles being indispensable to Catholic grief.  But whether it be so, or be a remnant of the ancient Saturnalia, or an incorporation of both, or have its origin in anything else, I shall always remember it, and the frolic, as a brilliant and most captivating sight: no less remarkable for the unbroken good-humour of all concerned, down to the very lowest (and among those who scaled the carriages, were many of the commonest men and boys), than for its innocent vivacity.  For, odd as it may seem to say so, of a sport so full of thoughtlessness and personal display, it is as free from any taint of immodesty as any general mingling of the two sexes can possibly be; and there seems to prevail, during its progress, a feeling of general, almost childish, simplicity and confidence, which one thinks of with a pang, when the Ave Maria has rung it away, for a whole year.\n\n\nAvailing ourselves of a part of the quiet interval between the termination of the Carnival and the beginning of the Holy Week: when everybody had run away from the one, and few people had yet begun to run back again for the other: we went conscientiously to work, to see Rome.  And, by dint of going out early every morning, and coming back late every evening, and labouring hard all day, I believe we made acquaintance with every post and pillar in the city, and the country round; and, in particular, explored so many churches, that I abandoned that part of the enterprise at last, before it was half finished, lest I should never, of my own accord, go to church again, as long as I lived.  But, I managed, almost every day, at one time or other, to get back to the Coliseum, and out upon the open Campagna, beyond the Tomb of Cecilia Metella.\n\nWe often encountered, in these expeditions, a company of English Tourists, with whom I had an ardent, but ungratified longing, to establish a speaking acquaintance.  They were one Mr. Davis, and a small circle of friends.  It was impossible not to know Mrs. Davis\u2019s name, from her being always in great request among her party, and her party being everywhere.  During the Holy Week, they were in every part of every scene of every ceremony.  For a fortnight or three weeks before it, they were in every tomb, and every church, and every ruin, and every Picture Gallery; and I hardly ever observed Mrs. Davis to be silent for a moment.  Deep underground, high up in St. Peter\u2019s, out on the Campagna, and stifling in the Jews\u2019 quarter, Mrs. Davis turned up, all the same.  I don\u2019t think she ever saw anything, or ever looked at anything; and she had always lost something out of a straw hand-basket, and was trying to find it, with all her might and main, among an immense quantity of English halfpence, which lay, like sands upon the sea-shore, at the bottom of it.  There was a professional Cicerone always attached to the party (which had been brought over from London, fifteen or twenty strong, by contract), and if he so much as looked at Mrs. Davis, she invariably cut him short by saying, \u2018There, God bless the man, don\u2019t worrit me!  I don\u2019t understand a word you say, and shouldn\u2019t if you was to talk till you was black in the face!\u2019  Mr. Davis always had a snuff-coloured great-coat on, and carried a great green umbrella in his hand, and had a slow curiosity constantly devouring him, which prompted him to do extraordinary things, such as taking the covers off urns in tombs, and looking in at the ashes as if they were pickles\u2014and tracing out inscriptions with the ferrule of his umbrella, and saying, with intense thoughtfulness, \u2018Here\u2019s a B you see, and there\u2019s a R, and this is the way we goes on in; is it!\u2019  His antiquarian habits occasioned his being frequently in the rear of the rest; and one of the agonies of Mrs. Davis, and the party in general, was an ever-present fear that Davis would be lost.  This caused them to scream for him, in the strangest places, and at the most improper seasons.  And when he came, slowly emerging out of some sepulchre or other, like a peaceful Ghoule, saying \u2018Here I am!\u2019 Mrs. Davis invariably replied, \u2018You\u2019ll be buried alive in a foreign country, Davis, and it\u2019s no use trying to prevent you!\u2019\n\nMr. and Mrs. Davis, and their party, had, probably, been brought from London in about nine or ten days.  Eighteen hundred years ago, the Roman legions under Claudius, protested against being led into Mr. and Mrs. Davis\u2019s country, urging that it lay beyond the limits of the world.\n\nAmong what may be called the Cubs or minor Lions of Rome, there was one that amused me mightily.  It is always to be found there; and its den is on the great flight of steps that lead from the Piazza di Sp\u00e1gna, to the church of Tr\u00ednita del Monte.  In plainer words, these steps are the great place of resort for the artists\u2019 \u2018Models,\u2019 and there they are constantly waiting to be hired.  The first time I went up there, I could not conceive why the faces seemed familiar to me; why they appeared to have beset me, for years, in every possible variety of action and costume; and how it came to pass that they started up before me, in Rome, in the broad day, like so many saddled and bridled nightmares.  I soon found that we had made acquaintance, and improved it, for several years, on the walls of various Exhibition Galleries.  There is one old gentleman, with long white hair and an immense beard, who, to my knowledge, has gone half through the catalogue of the Royal Academy.  This is the venerable, or patriarchal model.  He carries a long staff; and every knot and twist in that staff I have seen, faithfully delineated, innumerable times.  There is another man in a blue cloak, who always pretends to be asleep in the sun (when there is any), and who, I need not say, is always very wide awake, and very attentive to the disposition of his legs.  This is the dolce far\u2019 niente model.  There is another man in a brown cloak, who leans against a wall, with his arms folded in his mantle, and looks out of the corners of his eyes: which are just visible beneath his broad slouched hat.  This is the assassin model.  There is another man, who constantly looks over his own shoulder, and is always going away, but never does.  This is the haughty, or scornful model.  As to Domestic Happiness, and Holy Families, they should come very cheap, for there are lumps of them, all up the steps; and the cream of the thing is, that they are all the falsest vagabonds in the world, especially made up for the purpose, and having no counterparts in Rome or any other part of the habitable globe.\n\nMy recent mention of the Carnival, reminds me of its being said to be a mock mourning (in the ceremony with which it closes), for the gaieties and merry-makings before Lent; and this again reminds me of the real funerals and mourning processions of Rome, which, like those in most other parts of Italy, are rendered chiefly remarkable to a Foreigner, by the indifference with which the mere clay is universally regarded, after life has left it.  And this is not from the survivors having had time to dissociate the memory of the dead from their well-remembered appearance and form on earth; for the interment follows too speedily after death, for that: almost always taking place within four-and-twenty hours, and, sometimes, within twelve.\n\nAt Rome, there is the same arrangement of Pits in a great, bleak, open, dreary space, that I have already described as existing in Genoa.  When I visited it, at noonday, I saw a solitary coffin of plain deal: uncovered by any shroud or pall, and so slightly made, that the hoof of any wandering mule would have crushed it in: carelessly tumbled down, all on one side, on the door of one of the pits\u2014and there left, by itself, in the wind and sunshine.  \u2018How does it come to be left here?\u2019 I asked the man who showed me the place.  \u2018It was brought here half an hour ago, Signore,\u2019 he said.  I remembered to have met the procession, on its return: straggling away at a good round pace.  \u2018When will it be put in the pit?\u2019 I asked him.  \u2018When the cart comes, and it is opened to-night,\u2019 he said.  \u2018How much does it cost to be brought here in this way, instead of coming in the cart?\u2019 I asked him.  \u2018Ten scudi,\u2019 he said (about two pounds, two-and-sixpence, English).  \u2018The other bodies, for whom nothing is paid, are taken to the church of the Santa Maria della Consol\u00e1zione,\u2019 he continued, \u2018and brought here altogether, in the cart at night.\u2019  I stood, a moment, looking at the coffin, which had two initial letters scrawled upon the top; and turned away, with an expression in my face, I suppose, of not much liking its exposure in that manner: for he said, shrugging his shoulders with great vivacity, and giving a pleasant smile, \u2018But he\u2019s dead, Signore, he\u2019s dead.  Why not?\u2019\n\n\nAmong the innumerable churches, there is one I must select for separate mention.  It is the church of the Ara Coeli, supposed to be built on the site of the old Temple of Jupiter Feretrius; and approached, on one side, by a long steep flight of steps, which seem incomplete without some group of bearded soothsayers on the top.  It is remarkable for the possession of a miraculous Bamb\u00edno, or wooden doll, representing the Infant Saviour; and I first saw this miraculous Bamb\u00edno, in legal phrase, in manner following, that is to say:\n\nWe had strolled into the church one afternoon, and were looking down its long vista of gloomy pillars (for all these ancient churches built upon the ruins of old temples, are dark and sad), when the Brave came running in, with a grin upon his face that stretched it from ear to ear, and implored us to follow him, without a moment\u2019s delay, as they were going to show the Bamb\u00edno to a select party.  We accordingly hurried off to a sort of chapel, or sacristy, hard by the chief altar, but not in the church itself, where the select party, consisting of two or three Catholic gentlemen and ladies (not Italians), were already assembled: and where one hollow-cheeked young monk was lighting up divers candles, while another was putting on some clerical robes over his coarse brown habit.  The candles were on a kind of altar, and above it were two delectable figures, such as you would see at any English fair, representing the Holy Virgin, and Saint Joseph, as I suppose, bending in devotion over a wooden box, or coffer; which was shut.\n\nThe hollow-cheeked monk, number One, having finished lighting the candles, went down on his knees, in a corner, before this set-piece; and the monk number Two, having put on a pair of highly ornamented and gold-bespattered gloves, lifted down the coffer, with great reverence, and set it on the altar.  Then, with many genuflexions, and muttering certain prayers, he opened it, and let down the front, and took off sundry coverings of satin and lace from the inside.  The ladies had been on their knees from the commencement; and the gentlemen now dropped down devoutly, as he exposed to view a little wooden doll, in face very like General Tom Thumb, the American Dwarf: gorgeously dressed in satin and gold lace, and actually blazing with rich jewels.  There was scarcely a spot upon its little breast, or neck, or stomach, but was sparkling with the costly offerings of the Faithful.  Presently, he lifted it out of the box, and carrying it round among the kneelers, set its face against the forehead of every one, and tendered its clumsy foot to them to kiss\u2014a ceremony which they all performed down to a dirty little ragamuffin of a boy who had walked in from the street.  When this was done, he laid it in the box again: and the company, rising, drew near, and commended the jewels in whispers.  In good time, he replaced the coverings, shut up the box, put it back in its place, locked up the whole concern (Holy Family and all) behind a pair of folding-doors; took off his priestly vestments; and received the customary \u2018small charge,\u2019 while his companion, by means of an extinguisher fastened to the end of a long stick, put out the lights, one after another.  The candles being all extinguished, and the money all collected, they retired, and so did the spectators.\n\nI met this same Bamb\u00edno, in the street a short time afterwards, going, in great state, to the house of some sick person.  It is taken to all parts of Rome for this purpose, constantly; but, I understand that it is not always as successful as could be wished; for, making its appearance at the bedside of weak and nervous people in extremity, accompanied by a numerous escort, it not unfrequently frightens them to death.  It is most popular in cases of child-birth, where it has done such wonders, that if a lady be longer than usual in getting through her difficulties, a messenger is despatched, with all speed, to solicit the immediate attendance of the Bamb\u00edno.  It is a very valuable property, and much confided in\u2014especially by the religious body to whom it belongs.\n\nI am happy to know that it is not considered immaculate, by some who are good Catholics, and who are behind the scenes, from what was told me by the near relation of a Priest, himself a Catholic, and a gentleman of learning and intelligence.  This Priest made my informant promise that he would, on no account, allow the Bamb\u00edno to be borne into the bedroom of a sick lady, in whom they were both interested.  \u2018For,\u2019 said he, \u2018if they (the monks) trouble her with it, and intrude themselves into her room, it will certainly kill her.\u2019  My informant accordingly looked out of the window when it came; and, with many thanks, declined to open the door.  He endeavoured, in another case of which he had no other knowledge than such as he gained as a passer-by at the moment, to prevent its being carried into a small unwholesome chamber, where a poor girl was dying.  But, he strove against it unsuccessfully, and she expired while the crowd were pressing round her bed.\n\nAmong the people who drop into St. Peter\u2019s at their leisure, to kneel on the pavement, and say a quiet prayer, there are certain schools and seminaries, priestly and otherwise, that come in, twenty or thirty strong.  These boys always kneel down in single file, one behind the other, with a tall grim master in a black gown, bringing up the rear: like a pack of cards arranged to be tumbled down at a touch, with a disproportionately large Knave of clubs at the end.  When they have had a minute or so at the chief altar, they scramble up, and filing off to the chapel of the Madonna, or the sacrament, flop down again in the same order; so that if anybody did stumble against the master, a general and sudden overthrow of the whole line must inevitably ensue.\n\nThe scene in all the churches is the strangest possible.  The same monotonous, heartless, drowsy chaunting, always going on; the same dark building, darker from the brightness of the street without; the same lamps dimly burning; the selfsame people kneeling here and there; turned towards you, from one altar or other, the same priest\u2019s back, with the same large cross embroidered on it; however different in size, in shape, in wealth, in architecture, this church is from that, it is the same thing still.  There are the same dirty beggars stopping in their muttered prayers to beg; the same miserable cripples exhibiting their deformity at the doors; the same blind men, rattling little pots like kitchen pepper-castors: their depositories for alms; the same preposterous crowns of silver stuck upon the painted heads of single saints and Virgins in crowded pictures, so that a little figure on a mountain has a head-dress bigger than the temple in the foreground, or adjacent miles of landscape; the same favourite shrine or figure, smothered with little silver hearts and crosses, and the like: the staple trade and show of all the jewellers; the same odd mixture of respect and indecorum, faith and phlegm: kneeling on the stones, and spitting on them, loudly; getting up from prayers to beg a little, or to pursue some other worldly matter: and then kneeling down again, to resume the contrite supplication at the point where it was interrupted.  In one church, a kneeling lady got up from her prayer, for a moment, to offer us her card, as a teacher of Music; and in another, a sedate gentleman with a very thick walking-staff, arose from his devotions to belabour his dog, who was growling at another dog: and whose yelps and howls resounded through the church, as his master quietly relapsed into his former train of meditation\u2014keeping his eye upon the dog, at the same time, nevertheless.\n\nAbove all, there is always a receptacle for the contributions of the Faithful, in some form or other.  Sometimes, it is a money-box, set up between the worshipper, and the wooden life-size figure of the Redeemer; sometimes, it is a little chest for the maintenance of the Virgin; sometimes, an appeal on behalf of a popular Bamb\u00edno; sometimes, a bag at the end of a long stick, thrust among the people here and there, and vigilantly jingled by an active Sacristan; but there it always is, and, very often, in many shapes in the same church, and doing pretty well in all.  Nor, is it wanting in the open air\u2014the streets and roads\u2014for, often as you are walking along, thinking about anything rather than a tin canister, that object pounces out upon you from a little house by the wayside; and on its top is painted, \u2018For the Souls in Purgatory;\u2019 an appeal which the bearer repeats a great many times, as he rattles it before you, much as Punch rattles the cracked bell which his sanguine disposition makes an organ of.\n\nAnd this reminds me that some Roman altars of peculiar sanctity, bear the inscription, \u2018Every Mass performed at this altar frees a soul from Purgatory.\u2019  I have never been able to find out the charge for one of these services, but they should needs be expensive.  There are several Crosses in Rome too, the kissing of which, confers indulgences for varying terms.  That in the centre of the Coliseum, is worth a hundred days; and people may be seen kissing it from morning to night.  It is curious that some of these crosses seem to acquire an arbitrary popularity: this very one among them.  In another part of the Coliseum there is a cross upon a marble slab, with the inscription, \u2018Who kisses this cross shall be entitled to Two hundred and forty days\u2019 indulgence.\u2019  But I saw no one person kiss it, though, day after day, I sat in the arena, and saw scores upon scores of peasants pass it, on their way to kiss the other.\n\nTo single out details from the great dream of Roman Churches, would be the wildest occupation in the world.  But St. Stefano Rotondo, a damp, mildewed vault of an old church in the outskirts of Rome, will always struggle uppermost in my mind, by reason of the hideous paintings with which its walls are covered.  These represent the martyrdoms of saints and early Christians; and such a panorama of horror and butchery no man could imagine in his sleep, though he were to eat a whole pig raw, for supper.  Grey-bearded men being boiled, fried, grilled, crimped, singed, eaten by wild beasts, worried by dogs, buried alive, torn asunder by horses, chopped up small with hatchets: women having their breasts torn with iron pinchers, their tongues cut out, their ears screwed off, their jaws broken, their bodies stretched upon the rack, or skinned upon the stake, or crackled up and melted in the fire: these are among the mildest subjects.  So insisted on, and laboured at, besides, that every sufferer gives you the same occasion for wonder as poor old Duncan awoke, in Lady Macbeth, when she marvelled at his having so much blood in him.\n\nThere is an upper chamber in the Mamertine prisons, over what is said to have been\u2014and very possibly may have been\u2014the dungeon of St. Peter.  This chamber is now fitted up as an oratory, dedicated to that saint; and it lives, as a distinct and separate place, in my recollection, too.  It is very small and low-roofed; and the dread and gloom of the ponderous, obdurate old prison are on it, as if they had come up in a dark mist through the floor.  Hanging on the walls, among the clustered votive offerings, are objects, at once strangely in keeping, and strangely at variance, with the place\u2014rusty daggers, knives, pistols, clubs, divers instruments of violence and murder, brought here, fresh from use, and hung up to propitiate offended Heaven: as if the blood upon them would drain off in consecrated air, and have no voice to cry with.  It is all so silent and so close, and tomb-like; and the dungeons below are so black and stealthy, and stagnant, and naked; that this little dark spot becomes a dream within a dream: and in the vision of great churches which come rolling past me like a sea, it is a small wave by itself, that melts into no other wave, and does not flow on with the rest.\n\nIt is an awful thing to think of the enormous caverns that are entered from some Roman churches, and undermine the city.  Many churches have crypts and subterranean chapels of great size, which, in the ancient time, were baths, and secret chambers of temples, and what not: but I do not speak of them.  Beneath the church of St. Giovanni and St. Paolo, there are the jaws of a terrific range of caverns, hewn out of the rock, and said to have another outlet underneath the Coliseum\u2014tremendous darknesses of vast extent, half-buried in the earth and unexplorable, where the dull torches, flashed by the attendants, glimmer down long ranges of distant vaults branching to the right and left, like streets in a city of the dead; and show the cold damp stealing down the walls, drip-drop, drip-drop, to join the pools of water that lie here and there, and never saw, or never will see, one ray of the sun.  Some accounts make these the prisons of the wild beasts destined for the amphitheatre; some the prisons of the condemned gladiators; some, both.  But the legend most appalling to the fancy is, that in the upper range (for there are two stories of these caves) the Early Christians destined to be eaten at the Coliseum Shows, heard the wild beasts, hungry for them, roaring down below; until, upon the night and solitude of their captivity, there burst the sudden noon and life of the vast theatre crowded to the parapet, and of these, their dreaded neighbours, bounding in!\n\nBelow the church of San Sebastiano, two miles beyond the gate of San Sebastiano, on the Appian Way, is the entrance to the catacombs of Rome\u2014quarries in the old time, but afterwards the hiding-places of the Christians.  These ghastly passages have been explored for twenty miles; and form a chain of labyrinths, sixty miles in circumference.\n\nA gaunt Franciscan friar, with a wild bright eye, was our only guide, down into this profound and dreadful place.  The narrow ways and openings hither and thither, coupled with the dead and heavy air, soon blotted out, in all of us, any recollection of the track by which we had come: and I could not help thinking \u2018Good Heaven, if, in a sudden fit of madness, he should dash the torches out, or if he should be seized with a fit, what would become of us!\u2019  On we wandered, among martyrs\u2019 graves: passing great subterranean vaulted roads, diverging in all directions, and choked up with heaps of stones, that thieves and murderers may not take refuge there, and form a population under Rome, even worse than that which lives between it and the sun.  Graves, graves, graves; Graves of men, of women, of their little children, who ran crying to the persecutors, \u2018We are Christians!  We are Christians!\u2019 that they might be murdered with their parents; Graves with the palm of martyrdom roughly cut into their stone boundaries, and little niches, made to hold a vessel of the martyrs\u2019 blood; Graves of some who lived down here, for years together, ministering to the rest, and preaching truth, and hope, and comfort, from the rude altars, that bear witness to their fortitude at this hour; more roomy graves, but far more terrible, where hundreds, being surprised, were hemmed in and walled up: buried before Death, and killed by slow starvation.\n\n\u2018The Triumphs of the Faith are not above ground in our splendid churches,\u2019 said the friar, looking round upon us, as we stopped to rest in one of the low passages, with bones and dust surrounding us on every side.  \u2018They are here!  Among the Martyrs\u2019 Graves!\u2019  He was a gentle, earnest man, and said it from his heart; but when I thought how Christian men have dealt with one another; how, perverting our most merciful religion, they have hunted down and tortured, burnt and beheaded, strangled, slaughtered, and oppressed each other; I pictured to myself an agony surpassing any that this Dust had suffered with the breath of life yet lingering in it, and how these great and constant hearts would have been shaken\u2014how they would have quailed and drooped\u2014if a foreknowledge of the deeds that professing Christians would commit in the Great Name for which they died, could have rent them with its own unutterable anguish, on the cruel wheel, and bitter cross, and in the fearful fire.\n\nSuch are the spots and patches in my dream of churches, that remain apart, and keep their separate identity.  I have a fainter recollection, sometimes of the relics; of the fragments of the pillar of the Temple that was rent in twain; of the portion of the table that was spread for the Last Supper; of the well at which the woman of Samaria gave water to Our Saviour; of two columns from the house of Pontius Pilate; of the stone to which the Sacred hands were bound, when the scourging was performed; of the grid-iron of Saint Lawrence, and the stone below it, marked with the frying of his fat and blood; these set a shadowy mark on some cathedrals, as an old story, or a fable might, and stop them for an instant, as they flit before me.  The rest is a vast wilderness of consecrated buildings of all shapes and fancies, blending one with another; of battered pillars of old Pagan temples, dug up from the ground, and forced, like giant captives, to support the roofs of Christian churches; of pictures, bad, and wonderful, and impious, and ridiculous; of kneeling people, curling incense, tinkling bells, and sometimes (but not often) of a swelling organ: of Madonne, with their breasts stuck full of swords, arranged in a half-circle like a modern fan; of actual skeletons of dead saints, hideously attired in gaudy satins, silks, and velvets trimmed with gold: their withered crust of skull adorned with precious jewels, or with chaplets of crushed flowers; sometimes of people gathered round the pulpit, and a monk within it stretching out the crucifix, and preaching fiercely: the sun just streaming down through some high window on the sail-cloth stretched above him and across the church, to keep his high-pitched voice from being lost among the echoes of the roof.  Then my tired memory comes out upon a flight of steps, where knots of people are asleep, or basking in the light; and strolls away, among the rags, and smells, and palaces, and hovels, of an old Italian street.\n\n\nOn one Saturday morning (the eighth of March), a man was beheaded here.  Nine or ten months before, he had waylaid a Bavarian countess, travelling as a pilgrim to Rome\u2014alone and on foot, of course\u2014and performing, it is said, that act of piety for the fourth time.  He saw her change a piece of gold at Viterbo, where he lived; followed her; bore her company on her journey for some forty miles or more, on the treacherous pretext of protecting her; attacked her, in the fulfilment of his unrelenting purpose, on the Campagna, within a very short distance of Rome, near to what is called (but what is not) the Tomb of Nero; robbed her; and beat her to death with her own pilgrim\u2019s staff.  He was newly married, and gave some of her apparel to his wife: saying that he had bought it at a fair.  She, however, who had seen the pilgrim-countess passing through their town, recognised some trifle as having belonged to her.  Her husband then told her what he had done.  She, in confession, told a priest; and the man was taken, within four days after the commission of the murder.\n\nThere are no fixed times for the administration of justice, or its execution, in this unaccountable country; and he had been in prison ever since.  On the Friday, as he was dining with the other prisoners, they came and told him he was to be beheaded next morning, and took him away.  It is very unusual to execute in Lent; but his crime being a very bad one, it was deemed advisable to make an example of him at that time, when great numbers of pilgrims were coming towards Rome, from all parts, for the Holy Week.  I heard of this on the Friday evening, and saw the bills up at the churches, calling on the people to pray for the criminal\u2019s soul.  So, I determined to go, and see him executed.\n\nThe beheading was appointed for fourteen and a-half o\u2019clock, Roman time: or a quarter before nine in the forenoon.  I had two friends with me; and as we did not know but that the crowd might be very great, we were on the spot by half-past seven.  The place of execution was near the church of San Giovanni decoll\u00e1to (a doubtful compliment to Saint John the Baptist) in one of the impassable back streets without any footway, of which a great part of Rome is composed\u2014a street of rotten houses, which do not seem to belong to anybody, and do not seem to have ever been inhabited, and certainly were never built on any plan, or for any particular purpose, and have no window-sashes, and are a little like deserted breweries, and might be warehouses but for having nothing in them.  Opposite to one of these, a white house, the scaffold was built.  An untidy, unpainted, uncouth, crazy-looking thing of course: some seven feet high, perhaps: with a tall, gallows-shaped frame rising above it, in which was the knife, charged with a ponderous mass of iron, all ready to descend, and glittering brightly in the morning sun, whenever it looked out, now and then, from behind a cloud.\n\nThere were not many people lingering about; and these were kept at a considerable distance from the scaffold, by parties of the Pope\u2019s dragoons.  Two or three hundred foot-soldiers were under arms, standing at ease in clusters here and there; and the officers were walking up and down in twos and threes, chatting together, and smoking cigars.\n\nAt the end of the street, was an open space, where there would be a dust-heap, and piles of broken crockery, and mounds of vegetable refuse, but for such things being thrown anywhere and everywhere in Rome, and favouring no particular sort of locality.  We got into a kind of wash-house, belonging to a dwelling-house on this spot; and standing there in an old cart, and on a heap of cartwheels piled against the wall, looked, through a large grated window, at the scaffold, and straight down the street beyond it until, in consequence of its turning off abruptly to the left, our perspective was brought to a sudden termination, and had a corpulent officer, in a cocked hat, for its crowning feature.\n\nNine o\u2019clock struck, and ten o\u2019clock struck, and nothing happened.  All the bells of all the churches rang as usual.  A little parliament of dogs assembled in the open space, and chased each other, in and out among the soldiers.  Fierce-looking Romans of the lowest class, in blue cloaks, russet cloaks, and rags uncloaked, came and went, and talked together.  Women and children fluttered, on the skirts of the scanty crowd.  One large muddy spot was left quite bare, like a bald place on a man\u2019s head.  A cigar-merchant, with an earthen pot of charcoal ashes in one hand, went up and down, crying his wares.  A pastry-merchant divided his attention between the scaffold and his customers.  Boys tried to climb up walls, and tumbled down again.  Priests and monks elbowed a passage for themselves among the people, and stood on tiptoe for a sight of the knife: then went away.  Artists, in inconceivable hats of the middle-ages, and beards (thank Heaven!) of no age at all, flashed picturesque scowls about them from their stations in the throng.  One gentleman (connected with the fine arts, I presume) went up and down in a pair of Hessian-boots, with a red beard hanging down on his breast, and his long and bright red hair, plaited into two tails, one on either side of his head, which fell over his shoulders in front of him, very nearly to his waist, and were carefully entwined and braided!\n\nEleven o\u2019clock struck and still nothing happened.  A rumour got about, among the crowd, that the criminal would not confess; in which case, the priests would keep him until the Ave Maria (sunset); for it is their merciful custom never finally to turn the crucifix away from a man at that pass, as one refusing to be shriven, and consequently a sinner abandoned of the Saviour, until then.  People began to drop off.  The officers shrugged their shoulders and looked doubtful.  The dragoons, who came riding up below our window, every now and then, to order an unlucky hackney-coach or cart away, as soon as it had comfortably established itself, and was covered with exulting people (but never before), became imperious, and quick-tempered.  The bald place hadn\u2019t a straggling hair upon it; and the corpulent officer, crowning the perspective, took a world of snuff.\n\nSuddenly, there was a noise of trumpets.  \u2018Attention!\u2019 was among the foot-soldiers instantly.  They were marched up to the scaffold and formed round it.  The dragoons galloped to their nearer stations too.  The guillotine became the centre of a wood of bristling bayonets and shining sabres.  The people closed round nearer, on the flank of the soldiery.  A long straggling stream of men and boys, who had accompanied the procession from the prison, came pouring into the open space.  The bald spot was scarcely distinguishable from the rest.  The cigar and pastry-merchants resigned all thoughts of business, for the moment, and abandoning themselves wholly to pleasure, got good situations in the crowd.  The perspective ended, now, in a troop of dragoons.  And the corpulent officer, sword in hand, looked hard at a church close to him, which he could see, but we, the crowd, could not.\n\nAfter a short delay, some monks were seen approaching to the scaffold from this church; and above their heads, coming on slowly and gloomily, the effigy of Christ upon the cross, canopied with black.  This was carried round the foot of the scaffold, to the front, and turned towards the criminal, that he might see it to the last.  It was hardly in its place, when he appeared on the platform, bare-footed; his hands bound; and with the collar and neck of his shirt cut away, almost to the shoulder.  A young man\u2014six-and-twenty\u2014vigorously made, and well-shaped.  Face pale; small dark moustache; and dark brown hair.\n\nHe had refused to confess, it seemed, without first having his wife brought to see him; and they had sent an escort for her, which had occasioned the delay.\n\nHe immediately kneeled down, below the knife.  His neck fitting into a hole, made for the purpose, in a cross plank, was shut down, by another plank above; exactly like the pillory.  Immediately below him was a leathern bag.  And into it his head rolled instantly.\n\nThe executioner was holding it by the hair, and walking with it round the scaffold, showing it to the people, before one quite knew that the knife had fallen heavily, and with a rattling sound.\n\nWhen it had travelled round the four sides of the scaffold, it was set upon a pole in front\u2014a little patch of black and white, for the long street to stare at, and the flies to settle on.  The eyes were turned upward, as if he had avoided the sight of the leathern bag, and looked to the crucifix.  Every tinge and hue of life had left it in that instant.  It was dull, cold, livid, wax.  The body also.\n\nThere was a great deal of blood.  When we left the window, and went close up to the scaffold, it was very dirty; one of the two men who were throwing water over it, turning to help the other lift the body into a shell, picked his way as through mire.  A strange appearance was the apparent annihilation of the neck.  The head was taken off so close, that it seemed as if the knife had narrowly escaped crushing the jaw, or shaving off the ear; and the body looked as if there were nothing left above the shoulder.\n\nNobody cared, or was at all affected.  There was no manifestation of disgust, or pity, or indignation, or sorrow.  My empty pockets were tried, several times, in the crowd immediately below the scaffold, as the corpse was being put into its coffin.  It was an ugly, filthy, careless, sickening spectacle; meaning nothing but butchery beyond the momentary interest, to the one wretched actor.  Yes!  Such a sight has one meaning and one warning.  Let me not forget it.  The speculators in the lottery, station themselves at favourable points for counting the gouts of blood that spirt out, here or there; and buy that number.  It is pretty sure to have a run upon it.\n\nThe body was carted away in due time, the knife cleansed, the scaffold taken down, and all the hideous apparatus removed.  The executioner: an outlaw ex officio (what a satire on the Punishment!) who dare not, for his life, cross the Bridge of St. Angelo but to do his work: retreated to his lair, and the show was over.\n\n\nAt the head of the collections in the palaces of Rome, the Vatican, of course, with its treasures of art, its enormous galleries, and staircases, and suites upon suites of immense chambers, ranks highest and stands foremost.  Many most noble statues, and wonderful pictures, are there; nor is it heresy to say that there is a considerable amount of rubbish there, too.  When any old piece of sculpture dug out of the ground, finds a place in a gallery because it is old, and without any reference to its intrinsic merits: and finds admirers by the hundred, because it is there, and for no other reason on earth: there will be no lack of objects, very indifferent in the plain eyesight of any one who employs so vulgar a property, when he may wear the spectacles of Cant for less than nothing, and establish himself as a man of taste for the mere trouble of putting them on.\n\nI unreservedly confess, for myself, that I cannot leave my natural perception of what is natural and true, at a palace-door, in Italy or elsewhere, as I should leave my shoes if I were travelling in the East.  I cannot forget that there are certain expressions of face, natural to certain passions, and as unchangeable in their nature as the gait of a lion, or the flight of an eagle.  I cannot dismiss from my certain knowledge, such commonplace facts as the ordinary proportion of men\u2019s arms, and legs, and heads; and when I meet with performances that do violence to these experiences and recollections, no matter where they may be, I cannot honestly admire them, and think it best to say so; in spite of high critical advice that we should sometimes feign an admiration, though we have it not.\n\nTherefore, I freely acknowledge that when I see a jolly young Waterman representing a cherubim, or a Barclay and Perkins\u2019s Drayman depicted as an Evangelist, I see nothing to commend or admire in the performance, however great its reputed Painter.  Neither am I partial to libellous Angels, who play on fiddles and bassoons, for the edification of sprawling monks apparently in liquor.  Nor to those Monsieur Tonsons of galleries, Saint Francis and Saint Sebastian; both of whom I submit should have very uncommon and rare merits, as works of art, to justify their compound multiplication by Italian Painters.\n\nIt seems to me, too, that the indiscriminate and determined raptures in which some critics indulge, is incompatible with the true appreciation of the really great and transcendent works.  I cannot imagine, for example, how the resolute champion of undeserving pictures can soar to the amazing beauty of Titian\u2019s great picture of the Assumption of the Virgin at Venice; or how the man who is truly affected by the sublimity of that exquisite production, or who is truly sensible of the beauty of Tintoretto\u2019s great picture of the Assembly of the Blessed in the same place, can discern in Michael Angelo\u2019s Last Judgment, in the Sistine chapel, any general idea, or one pervading thought, in harmony with the stupendous subject.  He who will contemplate Raphael\u2019s masterpiece, the Transfiguration, and will go away into another chamber of that same Vatican, and contemplate another design of Raphael, representing (in incredible caricature) the miraculous stopping of a great fire by Leo the Fourth\u2014and who will say that he admires them both, as works of extraordinary genius\u2014must, as I think, be wanting in his powers of perception in one of the two instances, and, probably, in the high and lofty one.\n\nIt is easy to suggest a doubt, but I have a great doubt whether, sometimes, the rules of art are not too strictly observed, and whether it is quite well or agreeable that we should know beforehand, where this figure will be turning round, and where that figure will be lying down, and where there will be drapery in folds, and so forth.  When I observe heads inferior to the subject, in pictures of merit, in Italian galleries, I do not attach that reproach to the Painter, for I have a suspicion that these great men, who were, of necessity, very much in the hands of monks and priests, painted monks and priests a great deal too often.  I frequently see, in pictures of real power, heads quite below the story and the painter: and I invariably observe that those heads are of the Convent stamp, and have their counterparts among the Convent inmates of this hour; so, I have settled with myself that, in such cases, the lameness was not with the painter, but with the vanity and ignorance of certain of his employers, who would be apostles\u2014on canvas, at all events.\n\nThe exquisite grace and beauty of Canova\u2019s statues; the wonderful gravity and repose of many of the ancient works in sculpture, both in the Capitol and the Vatican; and the strength and fire of many others; are, in their different ways, beyond all reach of words.  They are especially impressive and delightful, after the works of Bernini and his disciples, in which the churches of Rome, from St. Peter\u2019s downward, abound; and which are, I verily believe, the most detestable class of productions in the wide world.  I would infinitely rather (as mere works of art) look upon the three deities of the Past, the Present, and the Future, in the Chinese Collection, than upon the best of these breezy maniacs; whose every fold of drapery is blown inside-out; whose smallest vein, or artery, is as big as an ordinary forefinger; whose hair is like a nest of lively snakes; and whose attitudes put all other extravagance to shame.  Insomuch that I do honestly believe, there can be no place in the world, where such intolerable abortions, begotten of the sculptor\u2019s chisel, are to be found in such profusion, as in Rome.\n\nThere is a fine collection of Egyptian antiquities, in the Vatican; and the ceilings of the rooms in which they are arranged, are painted to represent a starlight sky in the Desert.  It may seem an odd idea, but it is very effective.  The grim, half-human monsters from the temples, look more grim and monstrous underneath the deep dark blue; it sheds a strange uncertain gloomy air on everything\u2014a mystery adapted to the objects; and you leave them, as you find them, shrouded in a solemn night.\n\nIn the private palaces, pictures are seen to the best advantage.  There are seldom so many in one place that the attention need become distracted, or the eye confused.  You see them very leisurely; and are rarely interrupted by a crowd of people.  There are portraits innumerable, by Titian, and Rembrandt, and Vandyke; heads by Guido, and Domenichino, and Carlo Dolci; various subjects by Correggio, and Murillo, and Raphael, and Salvator Rosa, and Spagnoletto\u2014many of which it would be difficult, indeed, to praise too highly, or to praise enough; such is their tenderness and grace; their noble elevation, purity, and beauty.\n\nThe portrait of Beatrice di Cenci, in the Palazzo Berberini, is a picture almost impossible to be forgotten.  Through the transcendent sweetness and beauty of the face, there is a something shining out, that haunts me.  I see it now, as I see this paper, or my pen.  The head is loosely draped in white; the light hair falling down below the linen folds.  She has turned suddenly towards you; and there is an expression in the eyes\u2014although they are very tender and gentle\u2014as if the wildness of a momentary terror, or distraction, had been struggled with and overcome, that instant; and nothing but a celestial hope, and a beautiful sorrow, and a desolate earthly helplessness remained.  Some stories say that Guido painted it, the night before her execution; some other stories, that he painted it from memory, after having seen her, on her way to the scaffold.  I am willing to believe that, as you see her on his canvas, so she turned towards him, in the crowd, from the first sight of the axe, and stamped upon his mind a look which he has stamped on mine as though I had stood beside him in the concourse.  The guilty palace of the Cenci: blighting a whole quarter of the town, as it stands withering away by grains: had that face, to my fancy, in its dismal porch, and at its black, blind windows, and flitting up and down its dreary stairs, and growing out of the darkness of the ghostly galleries.  The History is written in the Painting; written, in the dying girl\u2019s face, by Nature\u2019s own hand.  And oh! how in that one touch she puts to flight (instead of making kin) the puny world that claim to be related to her, in right of poor conventional forgeries!\n\nI saw in the Palazzo Spada, the statue of Pompey; the statue at whose base C\u00e6sar fell.  A stern, tremendous figure!  I imagined one of greater finish: of the last refinement: full of delicate touches: losing its distinctness, in the giddy eyes of one whose blood was ebbing before it, and settling into some such rigid majesty as this, as Death came creeping over the upturned face.\n\nThe excursions in the neighbourhood of Rome are charming, and would be full of interest were it only for the changing views they afford, of the wild Campagna.  But, every inch of ground, in every direction, is rich in associations, and in natural beauties.  There is Albano, with its lovely lake and wooded shore, and with its wine, that certainly has not improved since the days of Horace, and in these times hardly justifies his panegyric.  There is squalid Tivoli, with the river Anio, diverted from its course, and plunging down, headlong, some eighty feet in search of it.  With its picturesque Temple of the Sibyl, perched high on a crag; its minor waterfalls glancing and sparkling in the sun; and one good cavern yawning darkly, where the river takes a fearful plunge and shoots on, low down under beetling rocks.  There, too, is the Villa d\u2019Este, deserted and decaying among groves of melancholy pine and cypress trees, where it seems to lie in state.  Then, there is Frascati, and, on the steep above it, the ruins of Tusculum, where Cicero lived, and wrote, and adorned his favourite house (some fragments of it may yet be seen there), and where Cato was born.  We saw its ruined amphitheatre on a grey, dull day, when a shrill March wind was blowing, and when the scattered stones of the old city lay strewn about the lonely eminence, as desolate and dead as the ashes of a long extinguished fire.\n\nOne day we walked out, a little party of three, to Albano, fourteen miles distant; possessed by a great desire to go there by the ancient Appian way, long since ruined and overgrown.  We started at half-past seven in the morning, and within an hour or so were out upon the open Campagna.  For twelve miles we went climbing on, over an unbroken succession of mounds, and heaps, and hills, of ruin.  Tombs and temples, overthrown and prostrate; small fragments of columns, friezes, pediments; great blocks of granite and marble; mouldering arches, grass-grown and decayed; ruin enough to build a spacious city from; lay strewn about us.  Sometimes, loose walls, built up from these fragments by the shepherds, came across our path; sometimes, a ditch between two mounds of broken stones, obstructed our progress; sometimes, the fragments themselves, rolling from beneath our feet, made it a toilsome matter to advance; but it was always ruin.  Now, we tracked a piece of the old road, above the ground; now traced it, underneath a grassy covering, as if that were its grave; but all the way was ruin.  In the distance, ruined aqueducts went stalking on their giant course along the plain; and every breath of wind that swept towards us, stirred early flowers and grasses, springing up, spontaneously, on miles of ruin.  The unseen larks above us, who alone disturbed the awful silence, had their nests in ruin; and the fierce herdsmen, clad in sheepskins, who now and then scowled out upon us from their sleeping nooks, were housed in ruin.  The aspect of the desolate Campagna in one direction, where it was most level, reminded me of an American prairie; but what is the solitude of a region where men have never dwelt, to that of a Desert, where a mighty race have left their footprints in the earth from which they have vanished; where the resting-places of their Dead, have fallen like their Dead; and the broken hour-glass of Time is but a heap of idle dust!  Returning, by the road, at sunset! and looking, from the distance, on the course we had taken in the morning, I almost feel (as I had felt when I first saw it, at that hour) as if the sun would never rise again, but looked its last, that night, upon a ruined world.\n\nTo come again on Rome, by moonlight, after such an expedition, is a fitting close to such a day.  The narrow streets, devoid of footways, and choked, in every obscure corner, by heaps of dunghill-rubbish, contrast so strongly, in their cramped dimensions, and their filth, and darkness, with the broad square before some haughty church: in the centre of which, a hieroglyphic-covered obelisk, brought from Egypt in the days of the Emperors, looks strangely on the foreign scene about it; or perhaps an ancient pillar, with its honoured statue overthrown, supports a Christian saint: Marcus Aurelius giving place to Paul, and Trajan to St. Peter.  Then, there are the ponderous buildings reared from the spoliation of the Coliseum, shutting out the moon, like mountains: while here and there, are broken arches and rent walls, through which it gushes freely, as the life comes pouring from a wound.  The little town of miserable houses, walled, and shut in by barred gates, is the quarter where the Jews are locked up nightly, when the clock strikes eight\u2014a miserable place, densely populated, and reeking with bad odours, but where the people are industrious and money-getting.  In the day-time, as you make your way along the narrow streets, you see them all at work: upon the pavement, oftener than in their dark and frouzy shops: furbishing old clothes, and driving bargains.\n\nCrossing from these patches of thick darkness, out into the moon once more, the fountain of Trevi, welling from a hundred jets, and rolling over mimic rocks, is silvery to the eye and ear.  In the narrow little throat of street, beyond, a booth, dressed out with flaring lamps, and boughs of trees, attracts a group of sulky Romans round its smoky coppers of hot broth, and cauliflower stew; its trays of fried fish, and its flasks of wine.  As you rattle round the sharply-twisting corner, a lumbering sound is heard.  The coachman stops abruptly, and uncovers, as a van comes slowly by, preceded by a man who bears a large cross; by a torch-bearer; and a priest: the latter chaunting as he goes.  It is the Dead Cart, with the bodies of the poor, on their way to burial in the Sacred Field outside the walls, where they will be thrown into the pit that will be covered with a stone to-night, and sealed up for a year.\n\nBut whether, in this ride, you pass by obelisks, or columns ancient temples, theatres, houses, porticoes, or forums: it is strange to see, how every fragment, whenever it is possible, has been blended into some modern structure, and made to serve some modern purpose\u2014a wall, a dwelling-place, a granary, a stable\u2014some use for which it never was designed, and associated with which it cannot otherwise than lamely assort.  It is stranger still, to see how many ruins of the old mythology: how many fragments of obsolete legend and observance: have been incorporated into the worship of Christian altars here; and how, in numberless respects, the false faith and the true are fused into a monstrous union.\n\nFrom one part of the city, looking out beyond the walls, a squat and stunted pyramid (the burial-place of Caius Cestius) makes an opaque triangle in the moonlight.  But, to an English traveller, it serves to mark the grave of Shelley too, whose ashes lie beneath a little garden near it.  Nearer still, almost within its shadow, lie the bones of Keats, \u2018whose name is writ in water,\u2019 that shines brightly in the landscape of a calm Italian night.\n\nThe Holy Week in Rome is supposed to offer great attractions to all visitors; but, saving for the sights of Easter Sunday, I would counsel those who go to Rome for its own interest, to avoid it at that time.  The ceremonies, in general, are of the most tedious and wearisome kind; the heat and crowd at every one of them, painfully oppressive; the noise, hubbub, and confusion, quite distracting.  We abandoned the pursuit of these shows, very early in the proceedings, and betook ourselves to the Ruins again.  But, we plunged into the crowd for a share of the best of the sights; and what we saw, I will describe to you.\n\nAt the Sistine chapel, on the Wednesday, we saw very little, for by the time we reached it (though we were early) the besieging crowd had filled it to the door, and overflowed into the adjoining hall, where they were struggling, and squeezing, and mutually expostulating, and making great rushes every time a lady was brought out faint, as if at least fifty people could be accommodated in her vacant standing-room.  Hanging in the doorway of the chapel, was a heavy curtain, and this curtain, some twenty people nearest to it, in their anxiety to hear the chaunting of the Miserere, were continually plucking at, in opposition to each other, that it might not fall down and stifle the sound of the voices.  The consequence was, that it occasioned the most extraordinary confusion, and seemed to wind itself about the unwary, like a Serpent.  Now, a lady was wrapped up in it, and couldn\u2019t be unwound.  Now, the voice of a stifling gentleman was heard inside it, beseeching to be let out.  Now, two muffled arms, no man could say of which sex, struggled in it as in a sack.  Now, it was carried by a rush, bodily overhead into the chapel, like an awning.  Now, it came out the other way, and blinded one of the Pope\u2019s Swiss Guard, who had arrived, that moment, to set things to rights.\n\nBeing seated at a little distance, among two or three of the Pope\u2019s gentlemen, who were very weary and counting the minutes\u2014as perhaps his Holiness was too\u2014we had better opportunities of observing this eccentric entertainment, than of hearing the Miserere.  Sometimes, there was a swell of mournful voices that sounded very pathetic and sad, and died away, into a low strain again; but that was all we heard.\n\nAt another time, there was the Exhibition of Relics in St. Peter\u2019s, which took place at between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening, and was striking from the cathedral being dark and gloomy, and having a great many people in it.  The place into which the relics were brought, one by one, by a party of three priests, was a high balcony near the chief altar.  This was the only lighted part of the church.  There are always a hundred and twelve lamps burning near the altar, and there were two tall tapers, besides, near the black statue of St. Peter; but these were nothing in such an immense edifice.  The gloom, and the general upturning of faces to the balcony, and the prostration of true believers on the pavement, as shining objects, like pictures or looking-glasses, were brought out and shown, had something effective in it, despite the very preposterous manner in which they were held up for the general edification, and the great elevation at which they were displayed; which one would think rather calculated to diminish the comfort derivable from a full conviction of their being genuine.\n\nOn the Thursday, we went to see the Pope convey the Sacrament from the Sistine chapel, to deposit it in the Capella Paolina, another chapel in the Vatican;\u2014a ceremony emblematical of the entombment of the Saviour before His Resurrection.  We waited in a great gallery with a great crowd of people (three-fourths of them English) for an hour or so, while they were chaunting the Miserere, in the Sistine chapel again.  Both chapels opened out of the gallery; and the general attention was concentrated on the occasional opening and shutting of the door of the one for which the Pope was ultimately bound.  None of these openings disclosed anything more tremendous than a man on a ladder, lighting a great quantity of candles; but at each and every opening, there was a terrific rush made at this ladder and this man, something like (I should think) a charge of the heavy British cavalry at Waterloo.  The man was never brought down, however, nor the ladder; for it performed the strangest antics in the world among the crowd\u2014where it was carried by the man, when the candles were all lighted; and finally it was stuck up against the gallery wall, in a very disorderly manner, just before the opening of the other chapel, and the commencement of a new chaunt, announced the approach of his Holiness.  At this crisis, the soldiers of the guard, who had been poking the crowd into all sorts of shapes, formed down the gallery: and the procession came up, between the two lines they made.\n\nThere were a few choristers, and then a great many priests, walking two and two, and carrying\u2014the good-looking priests at least\u2014their lighted tapers, so as to throw the light with a good effect upon their faces: for the room was darkened.  Those who were not handsome, or who had not long beards, carried their tapers anyhow, and abandoned themselves to spiritual contemplation.  Meanwhile, the chaunting was very monotonous and dreary.  The procession passed on, slowly, into the chapel, and the drone of voices went on, and came on, with it, until the Pope himself appeared, walking under a white satin canopy, and bearing the covered Sacrament in both hands; cardinals and canons clustered round him, making a brilliant show.  The soldiers of the guard knelt down as he passed; all the bystanders bowed; and so he passed on into the chapel: the white satin canopy being removed from over him at the door, and a white satin parasol hoisted over his poor old head, in place of it.  A few more couples brought up the rear, and passed into the chapel also.  Then, the chapel door was shut; and it was all over; and everybody hurried off headlong, as for life or death, to see something else, and say it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.\n\nI think the most popular and most crowded sight (excepting those of Easter Sunday and Monday, which are open to all classes of people) was the Pope washing the feet of Thirteen men, representing the twelve apostles, and Judas Iscariot.  The place in which this pious office is performed, is one of the chapels of St. Peter\u2019s, which is gaily decorated for the occasion; the thirteen sitting, \u2018all of a row,\u2019 on a very high bench, and looking particularly uncomfortable, with the eyes of Heaven knows how many English, French, Americans, Swiss, Germans, Russians, Swedes, Norwegians, and other foreigners, nailed to their faces all the time.  They are robed in white; and on their heads they wear a stiff white cap, like a large English porter-pot, without a handle.  Each carries in his hand, a nosegay, of the size of a fine cauliflower; and two of them, on this occasion, wore spectacles; which, remembering the characters they sustained, I thought a droll appendage to the costume.  There was a great eye to character.  St. John was represented by a good-looking young man.  St. Peter, by a grave-looking old gentleman, with a flowing brown beard; and Judas Iscariot by such an enormous hypocrite (I could not make out, though, whether the expression of his face was real or assumed) that if he had acted the part to the death and had gone away and hanged himself, he would have left nothing to be desired.\n\nAs the two large boxes, appropriated to ladies at this sight, were full to the throat, and getting near was hopeless, we posted off, along with a great crowd, to be in time at the Table, where the Pope, in person, waits on these Thirteen; and after a prodigious struggle at the Vatican staircase, and several personal conflicts with the Swiss guard, the whole crowd swept into the room.  It was a long gallery hung with drapery of white and red, with another great box for ladies (who are obliged to dress in black at these ceremonies, and to wear black veils), a royal box for the King of Naples and his party; and the table itself, which, set out like a ball supper, and ornamented with golden figures of the real apostles, was arranged on an elevated platform on one side of the gallery.  The counterfeit apostles\u2019 knives and forks were laid out on that side of the table which was nearest to the wall, so that they might be stared at again, without let or hindrance.\n\nThe body of the room was full of male strangers; the crowd immense; the heat very great; and the pressure sometimes frightful.  It was at its height, when the stream came pouring in, from the feet-washing; and then there were such shrieks and outcries, that a party of Piedmontese dragoons went to the rescue of the Swiss guard, and helped them to calm the tumult.\n\nThe ladies were particularly ferocious, in their struggles for places.  One lady of my acquaintance was seized round the waist, in the ladies\u2019 box, by a strong matron, and hoisted out of her place; and there was another lady (in a back row in the same box) who improved her position by sticking a large pin into the ladies before her.\n\nThe gentlemen about me were remarkably anxious to see what was on the table; and one Englishman seemed to have embarked the whole energy of his nature in the determination to discover whether there was any mustard.  \u2018By Jupiter there\u2019s vinegar!\u2019 I heard him say to his friend, after he had stood on tiptoe an immense time, and had been crushed and beaten on all sides.  \u2018And there\u2019s oil!  I saw them distinctly, in cruets!  Can any gentleman, in front there, see mustard on the table?  Sir, will you oblige me!  Do you see a Mustard-Pot?\u2019\n\nThe apostles and Judas appearing on the platform, after much expectation, were marshalled, in line, in front of the table, with Peter at the top; and a good long stare was taken at them by the company, while twelve of them took a long smell at their nosegays, and Judas\u2014moving his lips very obtrusively\u2014engaged in inward prayer.  Then, the Pope, clad in a scarlet robe, and wearing on his head a skull-cap of white satin, appeared in the midst of a crowd of Cardinals and other dignitaries, and took in his hand a little golden ewer, from which he poured a little water over one of Peter\u2019s hands, while one attendant held a golden basin; a second, a fine cloth; a third, Peter\u2019s nosegay, which was taken from him during the operation.  This his Holiness performed, with considerable expedition, on every man in the line (Judas, I observed, to be particularly overcome by his condescension); and then the whole Thirteen sat down to dinner.  Grace said by the Pope.  Peter in the chair.\n\nThere was white wine, and red wine: and the dinner looked very good.  The courses appeared in portions, one for each apostle: and these being presented to the Pope, by Cardinals upon their knees, were by him handed to the Thirteen.  The manner in which Judas grew more white-livered over his victuals, and languished, with his head on one side, as if he had no appetite, defies all description.  Peter was a good, sound, old man, and went in, as the saying is, \u2018to win;\u2019 eating everything that was given him (he got the best: being first in the row) and saying nothing to anybody.  The dishes appeared to be chiefly composed of fish and vegetables.  The Pope helped the Thirteen to wine also; and, during the whole dinner, somebody read something aloud, out of a large book\u2014the Bible, I presume\u2014which nobody could hear, and to which nobody paid the least attention.  The Cardinals, and other attendants, smiled to each other, from time to time, as if the thing were a great farce; and if they thought so, there is little doubt they were perfectly right.  His Holiness did what he had to do, as a sensible man gets through a troublesome ceremony, and seemed very glad when it was all over.\n\nThe Pilgrims\u2019 Suppers: where lords and ladies waited on the Pilgrims, in token of humility, and dried their feet when they had been well washed by deputy: were very attractive.  But, of all the many spectacles of dangerous reliance on outward observances, in themselves mere empty forms, none struck me half so much as the Scala Santa, or Holy Staircase, which I saw several times, but to the greatest advantage, or disadvantage, on Good Friday.\n\nThis holy staircase is composed of eight-and-twenty steps, said to have belonged to Pontius Pilate\u2019s house and to be the identical stair on which Our Saviour trod, in coming down from the judgment-seat.  Pilgrims ascend it, only on their knees.  It is steep; and, at the summit, is a chapel, reported to be full of relics; into which they peep through some iron bars, and then come down again, by one of two side staircases, which are not sacred, and may be walked on.\n\nOn Good Friday, there were, on a moderate computation, a hundred people, slowly shuffling up these stairs, on their knees, at one time; while others, who were going up, or had come down\u2014and a few who had done both, and were going up again for the second time\u2014stood loitering in the porch below, where an old gentleman in a sort of watch-box, rattled a tin canister, with a slit in the top, incessantly, to remind them that he took the money.  The majority were country-people, male and female.  There were four or five Jesuit priests, however, and some half-dozen well-dressed women.  A whole school of boys, twenty at least, were about half-way up\u2014evidently enjoying it very much.  They were all wedged together, pretty closely; but the rest of the company gave the boys as wide a berth as possible, in consequence of their betraying some recklessness in the management of their boots.\n\nI never, in my life, saw anything at once so ridiculous, and so unpleasant, as this sight\u2014ridiculous in the absurd incidents inseparable from it; and unpleasant in its senseless and unmeaning degradation.  There are two steps to begin with, and then a rather broad landing.  The more rigid climbers went along this landing on their knees, as well as up the stairs; and the figures they cut, in their shuffling progress over the level surface, no description can paint.  Then, to see them watch their opportunity from the porch, and cut in where there was a place next the wall!  And to see one man with an umbrella (brought on purpose, for it was a fine day) hoisting himself, unlawfully, from stair to stair!  And to observe a demure lady of fifty-five or so, looking back, every now and then, to assure herself that her legs were properly disposed!\n\nThere were such odd differences in the speed of different people, too.  Some got on as if they were doing a match against time; others stopped to say a prayer on every step.  This man touched every stair with his forehead, and kissed it; that man scratched his head all the way.  The boys got on brilliantly, and were up and down again before the old lady had accomplished her half-dozen stairs.  But most of the penitents came down, very sprightly and fresh, as having done a real good substantial deed which it would take a good deal of sin to counterbalance; and the old gentleman in the watch-box was down upon them with his canister while they were in this humour, I promise you.\n\nAs if such a progress were not in its nature inevitably droll enough, there lay, on the top of the stairs, a wooden figure on a crucifix, resting on a sort of great iron saucer: so rickety and unsteady, that whenever an enthusiastic person kissed the figure, with more than usual devotion, or threw a coin into the saucer, with more than common readiness (for it served in this respect as a second or supplementary canister), it gave a great leap and rattle, and nearly shook the attendant lamp out: horribly frightening the people further down, and throwing the guilty party into unspeakable embarrassment.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, as well as on the preceding Thursday, the Pope bestows his benediction on the people, from the balcony in front of St. Peter\u2019s.  This Easter Sunday was a day so bright and blue: so cloudless, balmy, wonderfully bright: that all the previous bad weather vanished from the recollection in a moment.  I had seen the Thursday\u2019s Benediction dropping damply on some hundreds of umbrellas, but there was not a sparkle then, in all the hundred fountains of Rome\u2014such fountains as they are!\u2014and on this Sunday morning they were running diamonds.  The miles of miserable streets through which we drove (compelled to a certain course by the Pope\u2019s dragoons: the Roman police on such occasions) were so full of colour, that nothing in them was capable of wearing a faded aspect.  The common people came out in their gayest dresses; the richer people in their smartest vehicles; Cardinals rattled to the church of the Poor Fishermen in their state carriages; shabby magnificence flaunted its thread-bare liveries and tarnished cocked hats, in the sun; and every coach in Rome was put in requisition for the Great Piazza of St. Peter\u2019s.\n\nOne hundred and fifty thousand people were there at least!  Yet there was ample room.  How many carriages were there, I don\u2019t know; yet there was room for them too, and to spare.  The great steps of the church were densely crowded.  There were many of the Contadini, from Albano (who delight in red), in that part of the square, and the mingling of bright colours in the crowd was beautiful.  Below the steps the troops were ranged.  In the magnificent proportions of the place they looked like a bed of flowers.  Sulky Romans, lively peasants from the neighbouring country, groups of pilgrims from distant parts of Italy, sight-seeing foreigners of all nations, made a murmur in the clear air, like so many insects; and high above them all, plashing and bubbling, and making rainbow colours in the light, the two delicious fountains welled and tumbled bountifully.\n\nA kind of bright carpet was hung over the front of the balcony; and the sides of the great window were bedecked with crimson drapery.  An awning was stretched, too, over the top, to screen the old man from the hot rays of the sun.  As noon approached, all eyes were turned up to this window.  In due time, the chair was seen approaching to the front, with the gigantic fans of peacock\u2019s feathers, close behind.  The doll within it (for the balcony is very high) then rose up, and stretched out its tiny arms, while all the male spectators in the square uncovered, and some, but not by any means the greater part, kneeled down.  The guns upon the ramparts of the Castle of St. Angelo proclaimed, next moment, that the benediction was given; drums beat; trumpets sounded; arms clashed; and the great mass below, suddenly breaking into smaller heaps, and scattering here and there in rills, was stirred like parti-coloured sand.\n\nWhat a bright noon it was, as we rode away!  The Tiber was no longer yellow, but blue.  There was a blush on the old bridges, that made them fresh and hale again.  The Pantheon, with its majestic front, all seamed and furrowed like an old face, had summer light upon its battered walls.  Every squalid and desolate hut in the Eternal City (bear witness every grim old palace, to the filth and misery of the plebeian neighbour that elbows it, as certain as Time has laid its grip on its patrician head!) was fresh and new with some ray of the sun.  The very prison in the crowded street, a whirl of carriages and people, had some stray sense of the day, dropping through its chinks and crevices: and dismal prisoners who could not wind their faces round the barricading of the blocked-up windows, stretched out their hands, and clinging to the rusty bars, turned them towards the overflowing street: as if it were a cheerful fire, and could be shared in, that way.\n\nBut, when the night came on, without a cloud to dim the full moon, what a sight it was to see the Great Square full once more, and the whole church, from the cross to the ground, lighted with innumerable lanterns, tracing out the architecture, and winking and shining all round the colonnade of the piazza!  And what a sense of exultation, joy, delight, it was, when the great bell struck half-past seven\u2014on the instant\u2014to behold one bright red mass of fire, soar gallantly from the top of the cupola to the extremest summit of the cross, and the moment it leaped into its place, become the signal of a bursting out of countless lights, as great, and red, and blazing as itself, from every part of the gigantic church; so that every cornice, capital, and smallest ornament of stone, expressed itself in fire: and the black, solid groundwork of the enormous dome seemed to grow transparent as an egg-shell!\n\nA train of gunpowder, an electric chain\u2014nothing could be fired, more suddenly and swiftly, than this second illumination; and when we had got away, and gone upon a distant height, and looked towards it two hours afterwards, there it still stood, shining and glittering in the calm night like a jewel!  Not a line of its proportions wanting; not an angle blunted; not an atom of its radiance lost.\n\nThe next night\u2014Easter Monday\u2014there was a great display of fireworks from the Castle of St. Angelo.  We hired a room in an opposite house, and made our way, to our places, in good time, through a dense mob of people choking up the square in front, and all the avenues leading to it; and so loading the bridge by which the castle is approached, that it seemed ready to sink into the rapid Tiber below.  There are statues on this bridge (execrable works), and, among them, great vessels full of burning tow were placed: glaring strangely on the faces of the crowd, and not less strangely on the stone counterfeits above them.\n\nThe show began with a tremendous discharge of cannon; and then, for twenty minutes or half an hour, the whole castle was one incessant sheet of fire, and labyrinth of blazing wheels of every colour, size, and speed: while rockets streamed into the sky, not by ones or twos, or scores, but hundreds at a time.  The concluding burst\u2014the Girandola\u2014was like the blowing up into the air of the whole massive castle, without smoke or dust.\n\nIn half an hour afterwards, the immense concourse had dispersed; the moon was looking calmly down upon her wrinkled image in the river; and half-a-dozen men and boys, with bits of lighted candle in their hands: moving here and there, in search of anything worth having, that might have been dropped in the press: had the whole scene to themselves.\n\nBy way of contrast we rode out into old ruined Rome, after all this firing and booming, to take our leave of the Coliseum.  I had seen it by moonlight before (I could never get through a day without going back to it), but its tremendous solitude that night is past all telling.  The ghostly pillars in the Forum; the Triumphal Arches of Old Emperors; those enormous masses of ruins which were once their palaces; the grass-grown mounds that mark the graves of ruined temples; the stones of the Via Sacra, smooth with the tread of feet in ancient Rome; even these were dimmed, in their transcendent melancholy, by the dark ghost of its bloody holidays, erect and grim; haunting the old scene; despoiled by pillaging Popes and fighting Princes, but not laid; wringing wild hands of weed, and grass, and bramble; and lamenting to the night in every gap and broken arch\u2014the shadow of its awful self, immovable!\n\nAs we lay down on the grass of the Campagna, next day, on our way to Florence, hearing the larks sing, we saw that a little wooden cross had been erected on the spot where the poor Pilgrim Countess was murdered.  So, we piled some loose stones about it, as the beginning of a mound to her memory, and wondered if we should ever rest there again, and look back at Rome.",

Lyrics\n\nRETURN\nOF THE\nJEDI\n\nby\nLawrence Kasdan\n&\nGeorge Lucas\n\nFrom The Novel\nby\nGeorge Lucas\n\nThird Draft\n\nProperty of Lucasfilm Ltd.\n\n\nCompletion Date December 1, 1981\n\n1    SPACE\n\nThe boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE, followed\nby a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.\n\nEpisode VI\nRETURN OF THE JEDI\n\nLuke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an\nattempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the\u00cavile\ngangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE\nhas secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even\nmore powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this\nultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels\nstruggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive\nsuperstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of\na giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small,\ngreen moon of ENDOR.\n\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored\nspace station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial\nshuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the\nDeath Star.\n\n2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\nThe shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.\n\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\nCommand station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting\nour approach. Deactivate the security shield.\n\nDEATH STAR CONTROLLER\t(filtered VO)\nThe security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have\nconfirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to\nproceed.\n\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\nWe're starting our approach.\n\n3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits\nswitches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death\nStar, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible\ndeflector shield.\n\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\n\nOFFICER\nInform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\n\nOPERATOR\nYes, sir.\n\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial\nshuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial\nstormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\n\n4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat,\nstrides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp.\nThe troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival.\nBut the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.\n\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this\nblack void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the\nassemblage as he walks down the ramp.\n\nJERJERROD\nLord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your\npresence.\n\nVADER\nYou may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you\nback on\nschedule.\n\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\n\nJERJERROD\nI assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.\n\nVADER\nPerhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\n\nJERJERROD\nI tell you, this station will be operational as planned.\n\nVADER\nThe Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\n\nJERJERROD\nBut he asks the impossible. I need more men.\n\nVADER\nThen perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\n\nJERJERROD\t (aghast)\nThe Emperor's coming here?\n\nVADER\nThat is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your\napparent lack of progress.\n\nJERJERROD\nWe shall double our efforts.\n\nVADER\nI hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.\n\n5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE\n\nA lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before\ncatching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along\nthe road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and\npoor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.\n\nArtoo whistles timidly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this\nJabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.\n\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.\n\n6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE\n\nThreepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly\nknocks on the iron door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (instantly)\nThere doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master\nLuke.\n\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical\narm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects\nthe two droids.\n\nSTRANGE VOICE\nTee chuta hhat yudd!\n\nTHREEPIO\nGoodness gracious me!\n\nThreepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\n\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the\neye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his\nconcern.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.\n\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the\nmassive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The\nrobots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at\none another, afraid to enter.\n\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby\ncompanion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should\nrush into all this.\n\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!\n\n7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY\n\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark\npassageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN\nGUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the\ntwo lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order.\nArtoo beeps nervously.\n\nTHREEPIO\nJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my!\nOh! Oh, no.\n\nWalking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike\nalien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.\n\nBIB\nDie Wanna Wanga!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master,\nJabba the Hutt.\n\nArtoo lets out a series of quick beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (cont)\n...and a gift.\n(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)\nGift, what gift?\n\nBib shakes his head negatively.\n\nBIB\nNee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\n\nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit,\nletting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the\nstrange-looking alien.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.\n\nBib thinks about this for a moment.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort\nof things.\n\nBib gestures for the droids to follow.\n\nBIB\nNudd Chaa.\n\nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed\nby the two guards.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, I have a bad feeling about this.\n\n8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES\never conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as\nthey pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts\npartially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the\nroom to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating\ncrowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a\nrepulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the\nhorrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At\nthe foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS\nCRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba\nlaughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows\npolitely.\n\nTHREEPIO\nGood morning.\n\nJABBA\nBo Shuda!\n\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned\nvillain.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThe message, Artoo, the message.\n\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,\ncreating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten\nfeet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.\n\nLUKE\nGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke\nSkywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are\npowerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally\npowerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's\nlife.\n(Jabba's crowd laughs)\nWith your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which\nwill be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant\nconfrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:\nthese two droids.\n\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat did he say?\n\nLUKE\t (cont)\n... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.\n\nLuke's hologram disappears.\n\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he\nis.\n\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne.\nHanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a\ncarbonized HAN SOLO.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\n\n9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR\n\nOne of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank,\nshadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable\ncreatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm\nor tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps\npitifully.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did?\nHe never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\n\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break\nfree, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.\n\n10   INT BOILER ROOM\n\nThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy\nmachinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are\nmet by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can\nbe seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work\ndroid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons\nare pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-\n9D9.\n\nNINEDENINE\nAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI am See-Threepio, human-cy...\n\nNINEDENINE\nYes or no will do.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh. Well, yes.\n\nNINEDENINE\nHow many languages do you speak?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can\nreadily...\n\nNINEDENINE\nSplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got\nangry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDisintegrated?\n\nNINEDENINE\t (to a Gamorrean guard)\nGuard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining\nbolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\n\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (disappearing)\nArtoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!\n\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps\nangrily.\n\nNINEDENINE\nYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have\nneed for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in\nnicely.\n\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured\nelectronic scream.\n\n11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a\nfat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.\n\nJabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons\nOola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away,\nshaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.\n\nJABBA\nDa Eitha!\n\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\n\nOOLA\nNa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\n\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\n\nJABBA\nBoscka!\n\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the\nfloor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a\nmuffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous\nfriends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her\nfate through a grate.\n\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han\nSolo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.\u00caAn\nunnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the\nroom, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two\nguards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his\ncaptive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\n\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into\nhis ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens\nintently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a\ngreeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).\n\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! Chewbacca!\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\n\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!\n\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh\nlistens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices\nBOBA FETT standing near the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the\nreward of twenty-five thousand.\n\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI want fifty thousand. No less.\n\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the\nraised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his\nweapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the\nthrone. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUh, oh... but what, what did I say?\n(to Boushh)\nUh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.\n\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio\nlooks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The\ndroid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.\n\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the\nroom. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the\nbounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba\nstares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across\nhis vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThis bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\n\nJabba continues.\n\nTHREEPIO\nJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\n\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his\nreaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes\ndead.\n\nBOUSHH\nZeebuss.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe agrees!\n\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a\nskiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing\ngirls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly\nappreciative creatures.\n\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the\nscene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across\nthe room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling\nhis weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\n\n12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL\n\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When\na tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes\nagainst the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror.\nIt takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming\nthe door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the\niron door.\n\n13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE\n\nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in\nfront, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert\nrodent and burps in satisfaction.\n\n14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several\ndrunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.\n\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of\nthe room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his\nway carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.\n\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his\ncoffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter\ndeactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of\nthe coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\n\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches\nand, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization\nlever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the\ncontours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches\nas Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands,\npreviously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His\nface muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\n\nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath\nof life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he\nbegins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.\n\nBOUSHH\nJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\n\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\n\nBOUSHH\nShhh. You have hibernation sickness.\n\nHAN\nI can't see.\n\nBOUSHH\nYour eyesight will return in time.\n\nHAN\nWhere am I?\n\nBOUSHH\nJabba's palace.\n\nHAN\nWho are you?\n\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\n\nLEIA\nSomeone who loves you.\n\nHAN\nLeia!\n\nLEIA\nI gotta get you out of here.\n\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is\npierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.\n\nHAN\nWhat's that? I know that laugh.\n\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the\nHutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his\ngross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\n\nHAN\nHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I\ngot a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.\n\nJabba laughs.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nIt's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but\nnow you're Bantha fodder.\n\nHAN\nLook...\n\nJABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)\nTake him away!\n\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\n\nHAN\nJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.\nDon't be a fool!\n\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead\nLeia away.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring her to me.\n\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young\nprincess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly\nturns away in disgust.\n\nLEIA\nWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI'm sure.\n\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly\nblob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\n\nLEIA\nUgh!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh, I can't bear to watch.\n\n15   INT DUNGEON CELL\n\nThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A\nguard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door\nslams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack\nin the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is\nheard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell\ndoor and listens.\n\nHAN\nChewie? Chewie, is that you?\n\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting\nhim off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,\nrevealing Chewie.\n\nHAN\nAh! Chew--Chewie!\n\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\n\nHAN\nWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?\n\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\n\nHAN\nLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less\nrescue anybody.\n\nChewie barks a reply.\n\nHAN\nA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets\ndelusions of grandeur.\n\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.\n\nHAN\nI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.\n\n16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE\n\nNoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT\nand reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a\nrobe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke\nstrides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block\nLuke's path. Luke halts.\n\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately\nlower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and\nmoves on down the hallway.\n\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they\napproach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his\ndirection and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the\nconversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.\n\nLUKE\nI must speak with Jabba.\n\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and\nstares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\n\nLUKE\nYou will take me to Jabba now!\n\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him\ninto the gloom.\n\nLUKE\nYou serve your master well.\n\nBib responds.\n\nLUKE\nAnd you will be rewarded.\n\n17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.\nSalacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a\nmanacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt.\nThreepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\n\nBIB\nMaster.\n\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\n\nBIB\n...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI told you not to admit him.\n\nLUKE\nI must be allowed to speak.\n\nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nHe must be allowed to speak.\n\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYou weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\n\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\n\nLUKE\nYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYour mind powers will not work on me, boy.\n\nLUKE\nNevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either\nprofit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not\nto underestimate my powers.\n\nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about\nthe pit.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, you're standing on...\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\n\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies\ninto Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his\nhand.\n\nJABBA\nBascka!\n\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into\nthe pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba\nlaughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained\nby a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at\nhim and he shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n18   INT RANCOR PIT\n\nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the\ndungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically\nfor help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in\nthe side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic.\nLuke looks calmly around for a means of escape.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! The Rancor!\n\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged\nRANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries\nfutilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.\n\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the\nRancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few\nscreams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers\nand laughs at the guard's fate.\n\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his\nsalivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the\nmonster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an\navalanche.\n\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\n\n19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT\n\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,\nlaughing.\n\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on\nan egg.\n\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\n\n21   INT RANCOR PIT\n\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead\nbeast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly\nat Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel\nand take Luke away.\n\n22   INT THRONE ROOM\n\nThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into\nthe throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\n\nLUKE\nHan!\n\nHAN\nLuke!\n\nLUKE\nAre you all right?\n\nHAN\nFine. Together again, huh?\n\nLUKE\nWouldn't miss it.\n\nHAN\nHow are we doing?\n\nLUKE\nThe same as always.\n\nHAN\nThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?\n\nLuke looks to Leia.\n\nLEIA\nI'm here.\n\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia\nlike a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from\nthe other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.\n\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed\nthat you are to be terminated immediately.\n\nHAN\nGood, I hate long waits.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of\nCarkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.\n\nHAN\t (to Luke)\nDoesn't sound so bad.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as\nyou are slowly digested over a thousand years.\n\nHAN\nOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\n\nChewie barks his agreement.\n\nLUKE\nYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever\nmake.\n\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\n\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer\nrises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but\nLuke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.\n\n23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF\n\nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by\ntwo smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke,\nHan, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is\nLando in disguise.\n\nHAN\nI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a\nbig light blur.\n\nLUKE\nThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.\n\nHAN\nYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\n\nLUKE\nJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\n\nHAN\nOh... great!\n\n24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His\nentire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time.\nLeia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to\nher neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to\nhim.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nSoon you will learn to appreciate me.\n\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller\ndroid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby\ndroid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\n\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.\nThey're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\n\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHmm.  I wish I had your confidence.\n\n25   EXT SARLACC PIT\n\nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one\nside of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's\nskiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of\nthe deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by\nthousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is\nextended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's\nbonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.\n\n26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward\nand the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps\nup to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of\nintergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across\nloudspeakers.\n\nTHREEPIO\nVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die\nhonorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba\nthe Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\n\n27   EXT SKIFF\n\nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\n\nHAN\nThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get\nno such pleasure from us. Right?\n\nChewie growls his agreement.\n\nLUKE\nJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\n\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look\nof conspiracy to him.\n\n28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as\nhe speaks into the comlink.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nMove him into position.\n\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\n\n29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK\n\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit.\nBelow, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the\nplank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a\njaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap\nopens in Artoo's domed head.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nPut him in.\n\n30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK\n\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is\nhappening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his\nfingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him\nskyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of\nthe plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He\ncasually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has\nsent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.\n\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded\nhim off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The\nother guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber\nflashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.\n\n31   EXT SARLACC PIT\n\nA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and\nbegins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him\nand pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.\n\n32   INT SAIL BARGE\n\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the\nguards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures\nwatching the action from the window are in an uproar.\n\n33   EXT SKIFF\n\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of\nthe Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.\n\nLUKE\nEasy, Chewie.\n\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts\nfrom a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of\nthe rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately\nabove the Sarlacc pit.\n\nLANDO\nWhoa! Whoa! Help!\n\n34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\n\nWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket\npack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.\n\n35   EXT SKIFF\n\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who\nhas freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire,\nthe young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty\nhunter's gun in half.\n\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck\ngun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the\nrail.\n\nHAN\nChewie, you okay? Where is he?\n\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\n\nHAN\nI'm okay, pal.\n\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a\ncable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong\ncable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from\nthe wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight\nup to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable\nand stands free.\n\nAnother blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\n\nLANDO\nHan! Chewie?\n\nHAN\nLando!\n\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets\nhim. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves\nin on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young\nJedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating\nthe guards from their midst.\n\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,\nguiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.\nHan searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold\nof the spear.\n\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the\nother skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his\narm, and aims his lethal appendage.\n\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\n\nHAN\nBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\n\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand\nwhacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\n\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts\noff, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the\nside of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams\nas his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into\nthe mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a\nweak congratulations to Han.\n\n36   INT SAIL BARGE\n\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and\nthrows the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous\nneck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the\nchain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath\nthe tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his\nscum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms\nthrough its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia\nstruggles to free herself of her bondage.\n\n37   EXT SKIFF\n\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously\nfrom a rope on the prisoner's skiff.\n\nHAN\nLando, grab it!\n\nLANDO\nLower it!\n\nHAN\nI'm trying!\n\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han\nand almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,\nand Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot\ncatches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.\nThe wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit\nfrom the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.\n\nHAN\nWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.\n\nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the\npit.\n\nHAN\nGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!\n\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck\ngun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the\nskiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail\nBarge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up\nthe hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his\nhead. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks\nthe helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.\n\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who\nis in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron\nhas stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by\nlying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand\nmoves him closer to his final reward.\n\nHAN\nGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!\n\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let\ngo of the spear.\n\nLANDO\nHold it! Whoa!\n\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\n\nHAN\nGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.\n\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\n\nHAN\nChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.\n\nLANDO\nNo, wait! I thought you were blind!\n\nHAN\nIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\n\nLANDO\nAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\n\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate\nfires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and\nChewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\n\nHAN\nChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!\n\n38   EXT UPPER DECK\n\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in\ntheir gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention:\nLuke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber.\nThe deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young\nJedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more\ngunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge)\nracing for him, firing their laser pistols.\n\n39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK\n\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips\nthrough the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby\nlittle droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.\n\nLEIA\nCome on. We gotta get out of here quick.\n\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and\nscreaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out\none of the golden droid's eyes.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!\n\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,\ncrashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye\ndangling from a wire) hurry off.\n\n40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\n\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by\nguards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke\nturns to face another guard.\n\nLUKE\t (to Leia)\nGet the gun! Point it at the deck!\n\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels\nthe gun around.\n\nLUKE\nPoint it at the deck!\n\nA laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain,\nbut manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the\nguards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He\nflexes the hand; it still works.\n\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves\nas Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.\n\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,\ntumbling toward the sand.\n\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she\nhas brought around to point down at the deck.\n\nLUKE\nCome on!\n\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers\nLeia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun\nexplodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.\n\n41   EXT SKIFF\n\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck.\nLuke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\n\nLUKE\nLet's go! And don't forget the droids.\n\nLANDO\nWe're on our way.\n\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge\ncraft is on fire.\n\n42   EXT SAND DUNE\n\nThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next\nto it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff\nfloats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire.\nWith a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled\nfrom the sand.\n\n43   EXT DUNE SEA\n\nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues\nits chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the\nbarge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.\n\n44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA\n\nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR\nTHE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand,\npressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed\nby Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each\nsupporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his\nwound.\n\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It\nis the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing\nand a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.\n\nHAN\nI don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!\n\nLEIA\nThat's all any of us can see.\n\nHAN\t (blinking)\nThen I guess I'm getting better.\n\nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind\ndies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition.\nThreepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.\n\nHAN \t(turning to Luke)\nI've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.\n\nLUKE\t (shrugging it off)\nI had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\n\nHAN\nNo, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest\nthing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide\nawake nothing!\n\nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior,\nmussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.\n\nLUKE \t(moving to his ship)\nI'll see you back at the fleet.\n\nHAN\nWhy don't you leave that crate and come with us?\n\nLUKE\nI have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\n\nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.\n\nHAN\n(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's\nbetrayal and subsequent aide)\nGuess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\n\nLANDO\nFigured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the\nrest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\n\nLEIA\nHe means \"You're welcome.\"\n\nLANDO\nCome on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.\n\n44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE\n\nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and\npeels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and\ngrows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.\n\n45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT\n\nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the\ncanopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM\nFALCON.\n\nLUKE\nI'll meet you back at the fleet.\n\nLEIA\t (over comlink)\nHurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\n\nLUKE\nI will.\n\nHAN\t (over comlink)\nHey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.\n\nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of\nLuke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black\nglove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.\n\nLUKE\nThat's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a\npromise to keep... to an old friend.\n\n46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR\n\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in\nspace above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor,\nEndor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward\nthe Death Star.\n\n47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY\n\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous\nDeath Star commander.\n\n48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR\n\nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth\ndocking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where\nthe shuttle is coming to rest.\n\nThe shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and\ncreate a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention\nwith a momentous SNAP.\n\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a\nrather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way\ndown the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak\nsimilar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's\nface is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow\neyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme\nRuler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.\n\nEMPEROR\t (to Vader)\nRise, my friend.\n\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way\nalong the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay\nkneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several\nImperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the\nprocession.\n\nVADER\nThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue\nyour search for young Skywalker.\n\nVADER\nYes, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does,\nyou must bring him\nbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the\ndark side of the\nForce.\n\nVADER\nAs you wish.\n\nEMPEROR\nEverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\n\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial\ntroops.\n\n49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH\n\nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of\nthe swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps\ndisconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm\nyellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.\n\n50   INT YODA'S HOUSE\n\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of\nthe cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that\nclutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.\nHis manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.\n\nYODA\nHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\n\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look\nhas been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\n\nLUKE\nNo... of course not.\n\nYODA\t (tickled, chuckles)\nI do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.\n(Points a crooked finger)\nWhen nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\n\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\n\nYODA\nSoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\n\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\n\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda, you can't die.\n\nYODA\nStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me\nand soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the\nForce.\n\nLUKE\nBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\n\nYODA\nNo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\n\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\n\nLUKE\nThen I am a Jedi?\n\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\n\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\n\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\n\nYoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile\ncreases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.\n\nYODA\nMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\n\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\n\nLUKE\nYoda, I must know.\n\nYODA\nYour father he is.\n\nLuke reacts as if cut.\n\nYODA\nTold you, did he?\n\nLUKE\nYes.\n\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.\n\nYODA\nUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...\n\nLUKE\nUnfortunate that I know the truth?\n\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\n\nYODA\t\t (gathering all his strength)\nNo. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your\ntraining. Not\nready for the burden were you.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I'm sorry.\n\nYODA\nRemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger,\nfear, aggression.\nThe dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever\nwill it dominate your\ndestiny.\n\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\n\nYODA\nLuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,\nor suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I\n(cough),\nthe last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your\nfamily. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...\n(with great effort)\nThere is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.\n\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears\nin front of his eyes.\n\n51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING\n\nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting,\nbut is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\n\nBEN\t (OS)\nYoda will always be with you.\n\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\n\nLUKE\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\n\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\n\nLUKE\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\n\nBEN\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be\nAnakin Skywalker\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a\ncertain point of view.\n\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\nA certain point of view!\n\nBEN\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend\ngreatly on our own\npoint of view.\n\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\n\nBEN\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened\nto your father was my fault.\n\nBen pauses sadly.\n\nBEN\nAnakin was a good friend.\n\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\n\nBEN\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the\ngalaxy.\n\nLuke is entranced.\n\nLUKE\nThere's still good in him.\n\nBEN\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Ben.\n\nBEN\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\n\nLUKE\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\n\nBEN\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been\nprepared.\n\nLUKE\nBut I had to help my friends.\n\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\n\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\n\nBEN\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\n\nLUKE\nI can't kill my own father.\n\nBEN\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\n\nLUKE\nYoda spoke of another.\n\nBEN\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\n\nLUKE\nBut I have no sister.\n\nBEN\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\n\nLUKE\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\n\nBEN\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They\ndo you credit.\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\n\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\n\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\n\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\n\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became\ndesperate.\n\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his\nsister.\n\nLUKE\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\n\nBEN\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy\nVader!\n\n52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a\ndozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and\nbattlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the\nHEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\n\n53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\n\nHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in\nthe WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a\nholographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the\nnearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.\n\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern\nbut beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several\nmilitary leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a\nsalmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he\nfinds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.\n\nHan peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\n\nHAN\nWell, look at you, a general, huh?\n\nLANDO\nOh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the\nbattle of Taanab.\n\nHAN\t (sarcastic)\nWell, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I\ndidn't know they were\nlookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\n\nLANDO\t (smiling)\nI'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\n\nHAN\nWell, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable\none, remember?\n\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.\n\nMON MOTHMA\nThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has\ncome.\n\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the\nDeath Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the\ncenter of the room.\n\nMON MOTHMA\nThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location\nof the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon\nsystems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial\nFleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is\nrelatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that\nthe Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the\nconstruction of this Death Star.\n\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia\nas Chewie barks his amazement.\n\nMON MOTHMA\t (cont)\nMany Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\n\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field\nand the Moon of Endor.\n\nACKBAR\nYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.\nAlthough the weapon\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does\nhave a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield,\nwhich is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield\nmust be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield\nis down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly\ninto the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\n\nThere's a concerned murmur.\n\nACKBAR\t (cont)\nGeneral Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\n\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\n\nHAN\nGood luck.\n\nLando nods his thanks.\n\nHAN\nYou're gonna need it.\n\nACKBAR\nGeneral Madine.\n\nMadine moves center stage.\n\nGENERAL MADINE\nWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and\nusing a secret\nImperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the\nshield generator.\n\nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSounds dangerous.\n\nLEIA\t (to Han)\nI wonder who they found to pull that off.\n\nGENERAL MADINE\nGeneral Solo, is your strike team assembled?\n\nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.\n\nHAN\nUh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.\n\nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.\n\nHAN\nWell, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.\n\nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.\n\nHAN\t (smiles)\nThat's one.\n\nLEIA\nUh, General... count me in.\n\nVOICE\t (OS)\nI'm with you, too!\n\nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more\ncheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and\nLeia are surprised and delighted.\n\nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him\nand looks into his eyes questioningly.\n\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\n\nLUKE\t (hesitant)\nAsk me again sometime.\n\nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.\n\nHAN\nLuke.\n\nLUKE\nHi, Han... Chewie.\n\nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\n\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.\n\n54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which\nlooks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay.\nChewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up\nthe shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and\nsupplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-\nbyes and start up the ramp.\n\nHAN\nLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the\nhelp you can get. She's\nthe fastest ship in the fleet.\n\nLANDO\nAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take\ngood care of her.\nShe-she won't get a scratch. All right?\n\nHAN\t (looks at him warmly)\nRight. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.\n\nLANDO\nLook, would you get going, you pirate.\n\nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.\n\nLANDO\nGood luck.\n\nHAN\nYou, too.\n\nHan goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.\n\n55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nLuke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the\npilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out\nall the Imperial controls.\n\nHAN\nYou got her warmed?\n\nLUKE\nYeah, she's comin' up.\n\nChewie growls a complaint.\n\nHAN\nNo. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed\nher, Chewie.\n\nLeia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.\n\nChewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on\nsomething out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him\ngently.\n\nLEIA\nHey, are you awake?\n\nHAN\nYeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.\n\nChewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the\nFalcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.\n\nLEIA\t (softly)\nCome on, General, let's move.\n\nHan snaps back to life.\n\nHAN\nRight. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready,\neverybody?\n\nLUKE\nAll set.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHere we go again.\n\nHAN\nAll right, hang on.\n\n56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the\nHeadquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms\noff into space.\n\n57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at\nthe far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair\nbefore a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death\nStar to the giant green moon of Endor.\n\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After\nseveral tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.\n\nVADER\nWhat is thy bidding, my Master?\n\nEMPEROR\nSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until\ncalled for.\n\nVADER\nWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\n\nEMPEROR\nIt is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young\nSkywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go\nout to the command ship and await my orders.\n\nVADER\nYes, my Master.\n\nVader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks\ntoward the waiting council members.\n\n58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON\n\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction\nproceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star\nDestroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces\nitself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.\n\n59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nHan looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.\nThrough the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star\nDestroyer can be seen.\n\nHAN\nIf they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty\nquick, Chewie.\n\nChewie growls his agreement.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\nWe have you on our screen now. Please identify.\n\nHAN\nShuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\nShuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.\n\nHAN\nTransmission commencing.\n\nLeia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed\ntransmission begins.\n\nLEIA\nNow we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.\n\nHAN\nIt'll work. It'll work.\n\nChewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer\nthat looms ever larger before them.\n\nLUKE\nVader's on that ship.\n\nHAN\nNow don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep\nyour distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep\nyour distance.\n\nChewie barks a question.\n\nHAN\nI don't know.  Fly casual.\n\nLUKE\nI'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.\n\nHAN\nIt's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.\n\nChewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out\nthe window.\n\n60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star.\nNow, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment\nof stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL\nPIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen\nearlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.\n\nVADER\nWhere is that shuttle going?\n\nPIETT\t (into comlink)\nShuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?\n\nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)\nParts and technical crew for the forest moon.\n\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\n\nVADER\nDo they have a code clearance?\n\nPIETT\nIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.\n\nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.\n\nPIETT\nShall I hold them?\n\nVADER\nNo. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\n\nPIETT\t (surprised)\nAs you wish, my lord.\n(to controller)\nCarry on.\n\nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.\n\n61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nThe group waits tensely.\n\nHAN\nThey're not goin' for it, Chewie.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (filtered)\nShuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.\nFollow your\npresent course.\n\nEveryone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks\nworried. Chewie barks.\n\nHAN\nOkay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.\n\n62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.\n\n63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark,\nprimeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\n\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a\nsteep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The\ntroops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio\nbringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\n\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly\nto the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke\ncrawl up to take a look.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I told you it was dangerous here.\n\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering\nthrough bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked\nnearby.\n\nLEIA\nShall we try and go around?\n\nHAN\nIt'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.\n\nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie\nstart quietly down.\n\n64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE\n\nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far\nfrom the two Imperial scouts.\n\nHAN\nChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\n\nLUKE\nQuietly, there might be more of them out there.\n\nHAN\t (grins)\nHey... it's me.\n\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts.\nLuke and Leia exchange smiles.\n\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout\nwhirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.\n\nSCOUT #1\nGo for help! Go!\n\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie\ngets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to\ncrash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.\n\nLUKE\t (sarcastic)\nGreat. Come on.\n\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol\ndrawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where\ntwo more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied\nbike parked nearby.\n\nLEIA\nOver there! Two more of them!\n\nLUKE\nI see them. Wait, Leia!\n\nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She\nstarts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.\n\nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls)\nQuick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\n\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely\navoiding two huge trees.\n\nHAN\nHey, wait! Ahhh!\n\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\n\n65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE\n\nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from\ntheir bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.\n\nLUKE\nMove closer!\n\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,\nslowing the scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet alongside that one!\n\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the\nremaining scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet him!\n\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a\nglancing hit.\n\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\n\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\n\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\n\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and\nrises out of sight.\n\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes\na glancing hit.\n\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a\nconflagration.\n\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are\nmoving as one.\n\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find\nLuke.\n\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\n\n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST\n\nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait\nanxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed\nhead and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!\n\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\n\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's\ntoo tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Where's Leia?\n\nLUKE\t (concerned)\nWhat? She didn't come back?\n\nHAN\nI thought she was with you.\n\nLUKE\nWe got separated.\n\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\n\nLUKE\nHey, we better go look for her.\n\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\n\nHAN\nTake the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\n\nLUKE\nCome on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.\n\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the\nsquad proceeds in another.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.\n\nThey move off into the woods.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo)\nAnd you said it was pretty here. Ugh!\n\n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\n\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into\nview. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and\ndisheveled.\n\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a\ndefensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins\npoking her with the sharp point of the spear.\n\nLEIA\nCut it out!\n\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\n\nLEIA\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\n\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of\nher speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.\n\nLEIA\nWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here\nis.\n\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from\nher fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log\nbeside her.\n\nLEIA\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\n\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia\npats the log again.\n\nLEIA\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\n\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\n\nLEIA\nAll right. You want something to eat?\n\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\n\nLEIA\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\n\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\n\nLEIA\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery\nlittle thing, aren't you?\n\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning\nto Leia.\n\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\n\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches\nout his hand for her weapon.\n\nSCOUT #l\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\n\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage\nin front of the log.\n\nSCOUT #1\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\n\nSCOUT #2\nYes, sir.\n\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards\nLeia with\u00canew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the\ndense foliage.\n\nLEIA\nCome on, let's get outta here.\n\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and\ntugs at Leia to follow him.\n\n68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER\n\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private\nelevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.\n\nGUARD\nHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\n\nVADER\n(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the\nForce)\nThe Emperor will see me, now!\n\nGUARD\n(repeating Vader's command)\nThe Emperor will see you, now.\n\n69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens\nto reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It\nappears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He\nwaits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark\nLord.\n\nEMPEROR\nI told you to remain on the command ship.\n\nVADER\nA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\n\nEMPEROR\t (no surprise)\nYes, I know.\n\nVADER\t (after a beat)\nMy son is with them.\n\nEMPEROR\t (very cool)\nAre you sure?\n\nVADER\nI have felt him, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are\nclear, Lord\nVader.\n\nVader knows what is being asked.\n\nVADER\nThey are clear, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\n\nVADER\t (skeptical)\nHe will come to me?\n\nEMPEROR\nI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will\ncome to you and\nthen you will bring him before me.\n\nVADER\t (bows)\nAs you wish.\n\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\n\n70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\n\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia.\nLuke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.\n\nHAN\t (OS)\nLuke! Luke!\n\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage\nof a speeder bike in the grass.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Master Luke.\n\nLUKE\nThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\n\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\n\nHAN\t (gravely)\nI hope she's alright.\n\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off\nthrough the foliage.\n\nHAN\nWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!\n\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along,\nArtoo whistles nervously.\n\n71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE\n\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a\ntall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from\nit.\n\nHAN\nHey, I don't get it.\n\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nNah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.\n\nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.\n\nLUKE\nChewie, wa-wait!  Don't!\n\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake.\nSPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net,\nsuspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of\nbeeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a\njumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.\n\nHAN\nNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.\n\nLUKE\nWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this\nthing.\n(trying to free an arm)\nHan, can you reach my lightsaber?\n\nHAN\nYeah, sure.\n\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting\nappendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an\narm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to\nspin.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-\nop!!\n\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,\ncrashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they\nrealize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long\nspear.\n\nHAN\nWha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\n\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok\nwarrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face.\nHe grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.\n\nHAN\nHey!\n\nLUKE\nHan, don't. It'll be all right.\n\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets\nthem take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.\n\nLUKE\nChewie, give 'em your crossbow.\n\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free\nof the net and sits up, rattled.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\n\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among\nthemselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok\nnearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In\na moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled\nbark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks\nbegin to chant at Threepio.\n\nLUKE\nDo you understand anything they're saying?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million\nforms of\ncommunication.\n\nHAN\nWhat are you telling them?\n\nTHREEPIO\nHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive\ndialect.  But\nI do believe they think I am some sort of god.\n\nChewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange\n\"what next?\" looks.\n\nHAN\nWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\n\nHAN\nProper?!\n\nTHREEPIO\nIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\n\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\n\nHAN\nWhy, you--\n\nSeveral Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their\ngod. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a\nmenacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands\nplacatingly.\n\nHAN\nMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\n\n72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS\n\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their\nprisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and\nwrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\n\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the\ncaptives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the\nremaining creatures.\n\n73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST\n\nThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the\ngiant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into\nnothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts\nand rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes\nhold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other\nEwoks follow suit.\n\n74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE\n\nThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks\ngather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the\nnewcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\n\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is\nplaced on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others\nare leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently\nplaced near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and\nChewie are less than fascinated.\n\nHAN\nI have a really bad feeling about this.\n\nChewie growls his concern.\n\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes\nout of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join\nThreepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A\nlarger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber\nwith great curiosity.\n\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing\nto the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit\nunder Han with firewood.\n\nHAN\nWhat did he say?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the\nmain course at a\nbanquet in my honor.\n\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut.\nLeia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening\nat the same moment the prisoners see her.\n\nHAN and LUKE\nLeia!\n\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.\n\nLEIA\nOh!\n\nTHREEPIO\nYour Royal Highness.\n\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\n\nLEIA\nBut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.\n\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads\nnegatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks\nsome orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue\nwith vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .\n\nHAN\nSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry\nand use your magic.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --\n\nLUKE\nJust tell them.\n\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps\nforward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to\nconcentrate.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\n\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the\nground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.\n\nTHREEPIO\n... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear!\nOh!\n\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio\nbegins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio\ncalling out in total panic at his situation.\n\nTHREEPIO\nPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help!\nMaster Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\n\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at\nhim, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground.\nLogray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground.\nWhen the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo\nbeeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,\nfinally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The\nEwok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group\nof Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and\nmarveling at his height.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\n\nLUKE\nThanks, Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken)\nI...I never knew I had it in me.\n\n75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS\n\nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room,\ncreating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne.\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\n\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War,\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers.\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\n\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\n\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\n\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer\nand screeches.\n\nHAN\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEIA\nI don't know.\n\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not\nnotice.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\n\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\n\nHAN\nJust what I always wanted.\n\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket\nclings to Han's leg.\n\nHAN\t (chuckles)\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.\n(to Wicket)\nThank you. Okay.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield\ngenerator.\n\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\n\nHAN\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try\nand get our weapons back.\n\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.\n\n76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and\nflicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft\nnight air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, what's wrong?\n\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\n\nLUKE\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\n\nLEIA\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\n\nLUKE\nWhat do you remember?\n\nLEIA\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\n\nLUKE\nTell me.\n\nLEIA\n(a little surprised at his insistence)\nShe was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.\n(looks up)\nWhy are you asking me all this?\n\nHe looks away.\n\nLUKE\nI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, tell me. What's troubling you?\n\nLUKE\nVader is here...now, on this moon.\n\nLEIA\t (alarmed)\nHow do you know?\n\nLUKE\nI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near.\nThat's why I have to go.\n(facing her)\nAs long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.\n(beat)\nI have to face him.\n\nLeia is distraught, confused.\n\nLEIA\nWhy?\n\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\n\nLUKE\nHe's my father.\n\nLEIA\nYour father?\n\nLUKE\nThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\n\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and\ncould never have.\n\nLUKE\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\n\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\n\nLUKE\nYes. It's you Leia.\n\nLEIA\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\n\nLUKE\nThen you know why I have to face him.\n\nLEIA\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\n\nLUKE\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\n\nLEIA\nBut, why must you confront him?\n\nLUKE\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I\nhave to try.\n\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\n\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only\nnow that she is crying.\n\nHAN\nHey, what's goin' on?\n\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\n\nLEIA\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\n\nHAN\t (angry)\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\n\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\n\nLEIA\nI...I can't tell you.\n\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\n\nLEIA\nI...\n\nHAN\nAhhh...\n\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\n\nHAN\nI'm sorry.\n\nLEIA\nHold me.\n\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.\n\n77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM\n\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands\ngracefully on the huge platform.\n\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of\nthe forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks\nparticularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\n\n78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK\n\nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into\nan elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward\nanother ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke,\nin binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with\ncomplete calm.\n\nCOMMANDER\nThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I\nbelieve there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct\na further search of the area.\n\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\n\nCOMMANDER\nHe was armed only with this.\n\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the\nlightsaber from the commander's hand.\n\nVADER\nGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his\ncompanions to me.\n\nCOMMANDER\nYes, my Lord.\n\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone\nin the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest\nfilter in upon them.\n\nVADER\nThe Emperor has been expecting you.\n\nLUKE\nI know, father.\n\nVADER\nSo, you have accepted the truth.\n\nLURE\nI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.\n\nVADER\t (turning to face him)\nThat name no longer has any meaning for me.\n\nLUKE\nIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there\nis good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is\nwhy you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your\nEmperor now.\n\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved\nhand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\n\nVADER\t (indicating lightsaber)\nI see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\n\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,\nbrilliant blade.\n\nVADER\nYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has\nforeseen.\n\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\n\nLUKE\nCome with me.\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan once thought as you do.\n\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\n\nVADER\nYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\n\nLUKE\nI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\n\nVADER\nIf that is your destiny.\n\nLUKE\nSearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict\nwithin you. Let go\nof your hate.\n\nVADER\nIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature\nof the Force. He is\nyour master now.\n\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring\nat one another for a long moment.\n\nLUKE\nThen my father is truly dead.\n\n79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR\n\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\n\nLEIA\nThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that\nlanding platform. This\nisn't gonna be easy.\n\nHAN\nHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily\nguarded than this.\n\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to\nThreepio.\n\nLEIA\nWhat's he saying?\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\n\n80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star\nCruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a\nspot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\n\n81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some\ngetting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando\nspeaks into his comlink.\n\nLANDO\nAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.\n\nACKBAR \t(VO)\nProceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\n\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\n\nLANDO\nDon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down\non time...\n(to himself)\nor this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.\n\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\n\nACKBAR\t (VO)\nAll craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.\n\nLANDO\nAll right. Stand by.\n\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\n\n82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then\nAckbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS\nINTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\n\n83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and\nPaploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is\nspread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that\nleads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes\nparked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an\nobservation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.\n\nHAN\nBack door, huh? Good idea.\n\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nIt's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\n\nLEIA\nWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\n\nHAN\t (with self-confident grin)\nThen we'll do it real quiet-like.\n\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks\nchatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers\ninto the underbrush.\n\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\n\nLEIA\nQuiet.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\n\nLEIA\nOh, no.\n\n84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE\n\nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto\none of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at\nrandom. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR.\nPaploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in\nsurprise.\n\n85   EXT RIDGE\n\nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\n\nHAN \t(sighs)\nThere goes our surprise attack.\n\n86   EXT BUNKER\n\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into\nmotion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.\n\nSCOUT\nLook! Over there! Stop him!\n\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away\nin pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.\n\n87   EXT RIDGE\n\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\n\nHAN\nNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here.\nWe'll take care of this.\n\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker.\nThreepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI have decided that we shall stay here.\n\n88   EXT FOREST\n\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary,\nbut he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him\nand begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds\na tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the\ntrees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the\nstill-flying, unoccupied bike.\n\n89   EXT BUNKER\n\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the\nshoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms\nof the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps\nout a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out\nof sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No\nsign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout\nbehind.\n\n90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk\nacross the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side\nby side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.\n\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down\nat Luke's binders.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou no longer need those.\n\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders\nfall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands,\nfree now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.\n\nEMPEROR\nGuards, leave us.\n\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\n\nEMPEROR\t (to Luke)\nI'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call\nme Master.\n\nLUKE\nYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\n\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke.\nThe Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can\nperceive the evil visage within the hood.\n\nEMPEROR\nOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are\nmistaken...about a great many things.\n\nVADER\nHis lightsaber.\n\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\n\nEMPEROR\nAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know\nyour father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with\nyou.\n\nLUKE\nYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\n\nThe Emperor laughs.\n\nEMPEROR\nPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\n\nLuke looks up sharply.\n\nEMPEROR\nYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\n\nVader looks at Luke.\n\nLUKE\nYour overconfidence is your weakness.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour faith in your friends is yours.\n\nVADER\nIt is pointless to resist, my son.\n\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\t (angry)\nEverything that has transpired has done so according to my design.\n(indicates Endor)\nYour friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\n\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\n\nEMPEROR\t (cont)\n...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who\nallowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It\nis quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my\nbest troops awaits them.\n\nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword\nin the Emperor's hand.\n\nEMPEROR\nOh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when\nyour friends arrive.\n\n91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and\nenter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.\n\nHAN\nAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.\n\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels.\nLeia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\n\nLEIA\nHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\n\nHAN\nCharges!  Come on, come on!\n\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at\nthe door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket)\nOh, my! They'll be captured!\n\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into\nthe forest.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.\n\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial\ncommander enters.\n\nCOMMANDER\nFreeze! You Rebel scum.\n\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them\nand their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them.\nEven more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent.\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.\n\n92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET\n\nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the\nRebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The\nMillennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the\nspace armada bears down on its target.\n\n93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.\n\nLANDO\nAll wings report in.\n\nWEDGE\nRed Leader standing by.\n\nGRAY LEADER\nGray Leader standing by.\n\nGREEN LEADER\nGreen Leader standing by.\n\nWEDGE\nLock S-foils in attack positions.\n\n94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar\nwatches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.\n\nACKBAR\nMay the Force be with us.\n\n95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to\nthe control panel and talks to Lando.\n\nLANDO\nWe've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up\nor down. Well, how\ncould they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.\n\nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the\nimplications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his\ncomlink.\n\nLANDO\nBreak off the attack! The shield is still up.\n\nRED LEADER\t (VO)\nI get no reading. Are you sure?\n\nLANDO\nPull up! All craft pull up!\n\nThe Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the\nDeath Star move off right.\n\n96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD\n\nThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid\nthe unseen wall.\n\n97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes\ncourse abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the\narmada tries to halt its forward momentum.\n\nACKBAR\nTake evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.\n\nA Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to\nAckbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.\n\nCONTROLLER\nAdmiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.\n\nOn the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive\nImperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.\n\nACKBAR\nIt's a trap!\n\nLANDO\t (over comlink)\nFighters coming in.\n\nThere is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an\narmada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in\nand around the giant Rebel cruisers.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nThere's too many of them!\n\nLANDO\nAccelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.\n\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader.\n\nThe battle continues around the giant cruisers.\n\n98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThrough the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the\ndistant flashes of the space battle in progress.\n\nEMPEROR\nCome, boy. See for yourself.\n\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side.\nLuke moves to look through a small section of the window.\n\nEMPEROR\nFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and\nthe end of your insignificant Rebellion.\n\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest\nof the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the\nlightsaber.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your\nJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to\nyour anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my\nservant.\n\nVader watches Luke in his agony.\n\nLUKE\nNo!\n\nEMPEROR\nIt is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now\nmine!\n\n99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the\nbunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now\ncrowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial\ntroops. The situation looks hopeless.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!\n\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps\nand whistles.\nAnd --\n\nTHREEPIO\nHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?\n\nBUNKER COMMANDER\nBring those two down here!\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nLet's go!\n\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nFreeze! Don't move!\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe surrender.\n\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\n\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the\ntrees above.\n\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes\nto the bunker door control panel.\n\nLEIA\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\n\nHAN\nHere's the terminal.\n\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\n\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked,\nruns after him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\n\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\n\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\n\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged\nbehind.\n\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between\ntwo trees.\n\n100  EXT SPACE\n\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat\nwith Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the\nRebel armada.\n\n101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel\nsquads.\n\nLANDO\nWatch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!\n\nWEDGE\nRed Three, Red Two, pull in!\n\nRED TWO\nGot it!\n\nRED THREE\nThree of them coming in, twenty degrees!\n\nWEDGE\nCut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical\nfrigate.\n\nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at\nthe TIEs from the belly guns.\n\nNAVIGATOR\nPressure's steady.\n\nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.\n\nLANDO\nOnly the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers\nare waiting for.\n\n102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET\n\nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the\nbattle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of\nthe fleet.\n\n103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nAdmiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge\nwindow of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.\n\nCOMMANDER\nWe're in attack position now, sir.\n\nPIETT\nHold here.\n\nCOMMANDER\nWe're not going to attack?\n\nPIETT\nI have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special\nplanned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.\n\n104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle\nfireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship\nexplodes against the protective shield.\n\nEMPEROR\nAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now\nwitness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle\nstation.\n(into comlink)\nFire at will, Commander.\n\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the\nRebel fleet beyond.\n\n105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands\nover them.\n\nJERJERROD\nFire!\n\n106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\n\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded\nImperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of\nlight emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side\nat a control panel.\n\n107  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to\nglow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.\n\n108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\n\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is\nhit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE\nfighters.\n\n109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser.\nLando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star\nfirepower.\n\nLANDO\nThat blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!\n(into comlink)\nHome One, this is Gold Leader.\n\n110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the\ncomlink.\n\nACKBAR\nWe saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\n\nLANDO\nYou won't get another chance at this, Admiral.\n\nACKBAR\nWe have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel\nfirepower of that magnitude.\n\nLANDO\nHan will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.\n\n111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover\nfire.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're coming!\n\nHAN\nCome on! Come on!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo, hurry!\n\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A\nlarge explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally\nlanding on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and\nsmoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn\naround to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his\nappendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in\nhis body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded\ncompanion.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\n\nHAN\nWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\n\nLEIA\nI'll cover you.\n\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the\nstormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the\nwing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting\nlaser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are\nstruck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then\nrealizes that he is dead.\n\n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR\n\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death\nStar's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star\nDestroyers.\n\n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating\ngiants. He's been yelling into the comlink.\n\nLANDO\t (desperately)\nYes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star\nDestroyers at point-\nblank range.\n\nACKBAR\nAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\n\nLANDO\nWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might\njust take a few of\nthem with us.\n\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and\nbegin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the\ngiant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.\n\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nShe's gonna blow!\n\nY-WING PILOT\nI'm hit!\n\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into\nthe control tower, exploding.\n\n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being\ndecimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there\nis no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not\nsurvive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will\ndie...as will your friends.\n\nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\n\nEMPEROR\nGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon!\nStrike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark\nside will be complete.\n\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber\nflashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the\nEmperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his\nfather.\n\n115  EXT FOREST\n\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated\nweapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the\nImperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.\n\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An\nEwok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The\nlogs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until\nit finally topples over with a great crash.\n\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end\nof the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-\ntightening circles until it runs out of rope and\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\n\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks\ncling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine,\nthen hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.\n\nWALKER PILOT #1\nLook!\n\nPILOT #2\nGet him off of there!\n\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked\nout and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into\nthe cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are\nthrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside,\nChewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch\nwith a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to\nlisten to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\n\nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at\nunsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The\nEwoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the\nbattle in their favor.\n\n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to\nhotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some\nstormtroopers.\n\nHAN\nI think I got it. I got it!\n\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a\nsecond blast door crashes down in front of the first.\n\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with\nstormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her\nshoulder hit by a laser blast.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\n\nHAN\nLet's see.\n\nLEIA\nIt's not bad.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS)\nFreeze!\n\nThey freeze.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nDon't move!\n\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two\nstormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment\nseems suspended in time.\n\nHAN\nI love you.\n\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\n\nLEIA\nI know.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nHands up! Stand up!\n\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She\ndisposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward\nLeia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him,\nits deadly weapons aimed right at him.\n\nHAN\t (to Leia)\nStay back.\n\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and\nbarks triumphantly.\n\nHAN\nChewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.\n\n117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even\nmore vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown\nstronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is\nforced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke\nstands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.\n\nEMPEROR (laughing)\nGood.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through\nyou.\n\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and\nrealizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his\nlightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan has taught you well.\n\nLUKE\nI will not fight you, father.\n\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\n\nVADER\nYou are unwise to lower your defenses.\n\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him.\n\nLUKE\nYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the\nconflict.\n\nVADER\nThere is no conflict.\n\nLUKE\nYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe\nyou'll destroy me now.\n\nVADER\nYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight,\nthen you will meet your destiny.\n\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him.\n\nEMPEROR\t (laughs)\nGood.  Good.\n\n118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\n\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each\nother in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer\nexplodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a\nseries of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next\nto a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the\nImperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack\none of the larger Imperial ships.\n\nLANDO\nWatch out. Squad at .06.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nI'm on it, Gold Leader.\n\nWEDGE\nGood shot, Red Two.\n\nLANDO\nNow...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.\n\n119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\n\nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an\nImperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and\ninterference.\n\nHAN/PILOT\t (VO)\nIt's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into\nthe woods. We\nneed reinforcements to continue the pursuit.\n\nThe controllers cheer.\n\nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER\nSend three squads to help. Open the back door.\n\nSECOND COMMANDER\nYes, sir.\n\n120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,\nthey're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their\nweapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the\nroof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\n\n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\n\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant\nexplosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\n\nHAN\nThrow me another charge.\n\n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne,\nsearching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.\n\nVADER\nYou cannot hide forever, Luke.\n\nLUKE\nI will not fight you.\n\nVADER\nGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your\nfriends. Yes, your\nthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially\nfor...\n\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in\nanguish.\n\nVADER\nSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed\nher, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.\n\nLUKE\nNever-r-r!\n\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather\nwith a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader\nfight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of\nthe low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft.\nEach stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.\n\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to\nblock another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the\nwrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical\nstump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves\nover Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat.\nThe Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.\n\nEMPEROR\nGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!\n\nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical,\nblack-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his\nfather. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in\npreparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.\n\nLUKE\nNever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness.\nI am a Jedi, like my father before me.\n\nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage.\n\nEMPEROR\nSo be it...Jedi.\n\n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across\nthe clearing.\n\nHAN\nMove! Move!\n\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a\nspectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes\nalong with the bunker.\n\n124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\n\nACKBAR\nThe shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.\n\nLANDO\nWe're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.\n(laughs)\nTold you they'd do it!\n\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward\nthe unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\n\n125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\nIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\n\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's\nhands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the\nForce to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a\nmoment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.\n\nEMPEROR\nYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\n\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the\nEmperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into\nthe bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You\nhave paid the price for your lack of vision.\n\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward\nwhere Vader stands watching.\n\nLUKE\t (groans)\nFather, please. Help me.\n\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.\n\nEMPEROR\nNow, young Skywalker...you will die.\n\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.\n\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.\n\nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls\ninto the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it\nexplodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is\nwhipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the\nbottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away\nfrom the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant\nwarrior are too weak to move.\n\n126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR\n\nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star\nto the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of\nthe giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.\n\nWEDGE\nI'm going in.\n\nLANDO\nHere goes nothing.\n\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed\nby the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who\ncontinually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as\nthey race through the dark shaft.\n\nLANDO\nNow lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power\ngenerator.\n\nWEDGE\nForm up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\n\nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by\nthe TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.\n\nLANDO\nSplit up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of\nthose TIE fighters to\nfollow you.\n\nPILOT\nCopy, Gold Leader.\n\nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and\nWedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon\nscrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast\naway at them.\n\nLANDO\nThat was too close.\n\nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages\non. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.\n\n127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nACKBAR\nWe've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on\nthat Super Star Destroyer.\n\nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.\n\n128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the\nbattle. They look concerned.\n\nCONTROLLER\nSir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.\n\nPIETT\nIntensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.\n\nThe commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel\nfighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.\n\nPIETT\nIntensify forward firepower!\n\nCOMMANDER\nIt's too late!\n\nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a\nhuge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the\nDeath Star, and explodes.\n\n129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides.\nThey cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.\n\n130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as\nthe Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading\na heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and\ndesperate to escape.\n\nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous\ndeadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle.\nFinally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as\nVader draws him closer.\n\nVADER\t (a whisper)\nLuke, help me take this mask off.\n\nLURE\nBut you'll die.\n\nVADER\nNothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my\nown eyes.\n\nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There\nbeneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the\ndying man smiles at the sight before him.\n\nANAKIN\t (very weak)\nNow...go, my son. Leave me.\n\nLUKE\nNo. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save\nyou.\n\nANAKIN\nYou already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you\nwere right.\n\nLUKE\nFather...I won't leave you.\n\nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.\n\nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half\ncarrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a\nshuttle.\n\n131  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense\nsuperstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers\noutside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is\nanswered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station\nitself.\n\n132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS\n\nLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing\nBaron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor\nshaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.\n\nWEDGE\nThere it is!\n\nLANDO\nAll right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.\n\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.\n\nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several\nproton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small\nexplosions.\n\nThe Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously\nclose, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a\npowerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.\n\nHe maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of\nthe continuing chain of explosions.\n\n133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,\nwatching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing\nroom.\n\nACKBAR\nMove the fleet away from the Death Star.\n\n134  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the\nmain docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown\naway.\n\nFinally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando\nexpertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and\nwhizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star\nsupernovas into oblivion.\n\n135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.\n\n136  EXT ENDOR FOREST\n\nHan and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all\nlook to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of\nself-destruction. They all cheer.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey did it!\n\nHan looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face.\nLeia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent\nvoice.\n\nHAN\nI'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.\n\nLEIA\nHe wasn't. I can feel it.\n\nHAN\nYou love him, don't you?\n\nLeia smiles, puzzled.\n\nLEIA\nYes.\n\nHAN\nAll right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the\nway.\n\nShe realizes his misunderstanding.\n\nLEIA\nOh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.\n\nHan is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.\n\n137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT\n\nLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his\nfather's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands,\nwatching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader --\nAnakin Skywalker.\n\nIn the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the\nforest.\n\n138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT\n\nA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and\nEwoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing,\ndancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and\nliberation.\n\nLando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then,\nfinally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him.\nThey stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's\ntouch, together to the end.\n\nRebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original\ngroup of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems\ndistracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.\n\nHe looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at\nthe edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nEND CREDITS OVER STAR FIELD", "http://genius.com/George-lucas-star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi-3rd-draft-annotated"], "543228": ["Hares On The Mountain by\u00a0Steeleye\u00a0Span", "Hares On The Mountain Lyrics\n\nYoung women they run like hares on the mountain\nAnd if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting\n\nYoung women they sing like birds in the bushes\nIf I was a young man I'd go beat them bushes\n\nYoung women they swim like ducks in the water\nIf I was a young man I'd soon go swim after\n\nYoung women they run like hares on the mountain\nAnd if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting", "http://genius.com/Steeleye-span-hares-on-the-mountain-lyrics"], "1726847": ["Artists' Rifles by\u00a0Piano\u00a0Magic", "Artists' Rifles Lyrics\n\n1914 - 1918\nI've got your letter here, i've got your memories\nYoung men, as us - broken soldiers\nI've got your telegram, i've got your souvenirs\n1914 - 1918\nI've got your photograph, i've got your poetry\nYoung men, as us - Artists' Rifles\nYoung men, as us - Artists' Rifles", "http://genius.com/Piano-magic-artists-rifles-lyrics"]}
