{"101377": ["Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) Lyrics\n\nI was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\n\n\u2014Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J.

Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R.

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai!

The camera keeps slowly zooming out until it arrives in one particular room of this hotel.\nA group of business associates have gathered together, dressed in suits, seated at a table as they are served beverages and drinks. There are eight of them in total, and the mood is casual as each of them are comfortable and joking back and forth.\nThe camera focuses on an African American man at the head of the table, as a voiceover from him is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nHi, for those of you joining in on the action, my name is James Smith, and I\u2019m the leader of a business, The Invisible Hand, which is currently paired with the largest casino chain in the entire world. Needless to say, we\u2019re doing great business. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. I started out as a paperboy, of rather modest beginnings in a pretty dismal neighborhood and I worked my way up through the ranks until finally I could invest and created my own business. It\u2019s the American dream. However, I owe a bunch of credit to the men that you see seated here. They are my closest friends, confidantes, and associates and nothing would be accomplished without them and their hard work. I wouldn\u2019t want to work with anyone else in the entire world and I\u2019ve been very fortunate. All the same, this business can start to take a toll on you. I\u2019ve been really wanting to retire and hopefully I will some day soon.\nThe camera pans left and focuses on the man seated next to Smith, a white rich man with a crew cut and a completely different story to tell, as his voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nThe name\u2019s Jake Williams. I guess you could say that in this business, I\u2019m James\u2019 right hand man. Our stories, are completely different. I was fortunate enough to be born into the household of a very well paid lawyer, the very best in the region. It wasn\u2019t hard, at least rivaled by James, but I can\u2019t help but thank the people who have gotten me to this point. It\u2019s all about connections and who you know in this business. You\u2019ve always gotta make friends. But the deal is, as long as you\u2019re always making friends, you're always making enemies.\nThe camera pans to the right of Smith, another white rich man who has his hair back, it\u2019s quite obvious this guy is the high roller of the group. His voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nJohn Graham. I inherited a ton of cash, and invested a lot of it, which was the most logical thing to do. But unlike many people who just inherit their money, I didn\u2019t just spend it on whatever the hell I wanted. I was very conservative about my dough and I held onto it and watched it build up until I could do whatever the hell I wanted. This is the life everyone dreams of but never attains. That\u2019s something to be proud of, a sense of sincere accomplishment.\nThe camera pans to the left of Williams, a white businessman with a crew cut, who seems like he has his own agenda. His voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nMy name is Steve Jones, and I came from a middle class household, and came up as a lawyer with several critical cases. I was hired by The Invisible Hand, thanks to the notoriety many of these cases gave me. In case you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s because I\u2019m a damn good lawyer. I\u2019m not trying to brag, just being honest. There\u2019s an art to winning cases, a winning formula if you will. Sooner rather than later, I\u2019d like to take on my own cases and be embroiled in my own business rather than just being a cog in the wheel. All the same, these things take time. I tend to be a very patient man.\nThe camera pans to the right of Graham, a Jewish businessman that everyone seems to get along with everyone. His voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nName\u2019s Dan Wilson. I come from a middle class family from Brooklyn, and I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. The Invisible Hand liked my work, and they met with me and I joined. A bunch of great class acts, they really are. However, some of the people we deal with just bother me, same as the conditions we operate under. I don\u2019t know, just a minor complaint. Hell, what am I doing? Really, forget that, I can\u2019t complain, I\u2019ve been blessed.\nThe camera pans to the left of Jones, another white businessman that seems to be the most detached, yet damaged of the group. His voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nI\u2019m Jason Davis. I\u2019ve been with The Invisible Hand for a few years now and I have to say, I\u2019m having the time of my life. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve always been the guy caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Being hired here was just, plain and simple, the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\nThe camera pans to the right of Wilson, another white businessman with his hair slicked back that obviously looks like he means business. His voiceover is heard.\nVOICEOVER\nSean Miller. Started out as a prime time boxer, until these guys even offered me more money. They see me as an enforcer, and I guess it makes sense in a way. There isn't nobody afraid of Sean Miller. I\u2019m not even trying to boast. You fuck with me, you will die.\nThe camera pans to the left of Davis, the youngest of the group, also with a crew cut. His voiceover is overheard.\nVOICEOVER\nName\u2019s Dave Brown. I\u2019m the youngest of the members of this business organization, and I guess there\u2019s a learning curve for me that\u2019s not present with the others, at least at the moment. They all have experiences that I will soon garner and inherit, and I\u2019m fortunate to be looking up to, learning, and working with these guys. At the same time, I don\u2019t at all view myself as the little brother of all these guys. I think I can stand toe to toe with each of them.\nThe camera fades out and then suddenly cuts instantly to a club, booming music from Drake, Kid Ink, and Jeremih.\nGraham, Jones, and Williams sit at a table off to the side.\nGRAHAM\nCan\u2019t get much better than this, fellas!\nJONES\nI think I\u2019m going to need a vacation from the vacation.\nGRAHAM\nWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\nJONES\nThis shit's all too good to be true, man haha.\nGRAHAM\nCome on, Jones, don\u2019t be such a fucking square.\nJONES\nCheck yourself out. Gambling. Lying. Infidelity. Being the role model for assholes all over America. That shit'll catch up you, you know. Never underestimate the capability,or better said the stupidity (other guys laugh) of your own flaws.\nWILLIAMS\nStevie\u2019s got his point.\nGRAHAM\nStevie\u2019s got his dick in his hands. You guys are on some philosophical, namby pamby, 'realistic' bullshit. You're taking life way too seriously. You go to do what you want, when you want, and however you want. Otherwise you'll die, because you had no reason to live. There's some fucking philosophy for you, man. (says \"philosophy\" in a mocking tone).\nJONES\nYeah, but there\u2019s nobody, even in hell, that would give you the right to take advantage of people.\n(Graham immediately gets up and stands aggressively in front of Jones.)\nGRAHAM\nDon\u2019t tell me how to live my fucking life!\nWILLIAMS\nWhy don\u2019t you sit, and calm the hell down?\nGRAHAM\nWhy don\u2019t you quit being the middleman all the time? Hey, I'm looking at you, Williams.\nWILLIAMS\nYou fucking simpletons, look...\nGRAHAM\nHe\u2019s a big boy, let him speak for himself.\nJONES\nDo whatever you want, Graham.\nAfter a brief moment, Graham gets up and leaves.\nGRAHAM\nFucking pricks...\nJones turns to Williams.\nJONES\nEvery time with this asshole. I\u2019m telling you I will, just somehow, I\u2019ll-\nWILLIAMS\nSnap. \u201cAnd then Graham\u2019s gonna repent it. He\u2019s gonna fucking repent it and after that he\u2019ll think twice the next time he tries to act smart, and realize he isn\u2019t. I\u2019m telling you, man. One day. I can feel it.\u201d (Jones looks relatively shocked) You wanna grab my attention? Sing a different song. (Williams chuckles and pats Jones on the shoulder) Come on man, everything\u2019s all good. It\u2019s child\u2019s play.\nJONES\nIt\u2019s trivial. Like a goddamn movie character with this guy. His ways of living are incredibly grandiose. Too grandiose. Yet he ceases to impress me, let alone convince me to take him seriously.\nWILLIAMS\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\nJONES\nOh, so you\u2019re gonna jump on his side on the fence now.\nWILLIAMS\n(Williams sighs, and puts his drink down) Alright, calm your nerves, and listen. I'm just trying to reason with you here, you shouldn't be fighting over shit like this.\nJONES\nWhat you don\u2019t understand, Williams, is that when two people have a significant amount of differences, there's bound to be conflict. It\u2019s inevitable. We can fucking hold hands, we can laugh together when you crack a joke, acting like we\u2019re friends, but that's all it's gonna be. An act. Now, acknowledging this cold hard fact, you're probably gonna tell me to at least pretend to have some common ground. But, that's not me. I'm not a faker. And I surely don't see the point in pretending that me and this man are friends. Whether any of you choose to accept that or not. And I certainly don't have any good to say as per Graham and his way of life. That's probably just me, but I\u2019m not gonna just sit here and play witness to a fraud. I'm gonna react, and you can bet your sweet ass he's gonna get what's coming to him. (puts drink down fiercely) Gotta hit the can.\nCut over to the opposite side of the club, near the bar.\nBrown and Miller go to get drinks and Miller notices the girl Brown has his eyes set on, Danielle.\nMiller starts joking around when he notices it, but Brown is acting bashful and nervous.\nMILLER\nThis motherfucker!\nBROWN\nYo, cut it out!\nMILLER\nAw, come on. Be a man and get over there.\nBROWN\nHow do you even know that I like her? Maybe I just don\u2019t appreciate your humiliation.\nMILLER\nDo I have your pants around your ankles? Is your dick out? Does she even know who the fuck you are? Mate, who\u2019s hands are gonna be down your pants by tonight? Yours? Or hers?\nBROWN\nI already told you man, I\u2019m not interested. Believe it or not, Mills, there\u2019s more to a girl than just a face and a body.\nMILLER\nNot true. At least not before you meet them.\neveryone\u2019s just a piece of meat before they introduce themselves aren\u2019t they? So you gonna talk to her?\nYou better before I do. That\u2019s not a promise, it\u2019s a guarantee.\nBROWN\nDude, come on, don\u2019t do this\nMILLER\nAhh, so you are interested after all. That\u2019ll make this easier. Give me a second.\nBROWN\nCome on!! Mills!!\nMiller walks over to Danielle and sits next to her.\nMILLER\nWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\nDANIELLE\nDo I know you?\nMILLER\nCan\u2019t say we\u2019ve met before.\nDANIELLE\nThen what\u2019s the deal?\nMILLER\nNo deal, I saw you sitting here alone. Is that a problem?\nDANIELLE\nWhat if I was waiting for someone?\nMILLER\nWhat if you were?\nDanielle waves off the question.\nMILLER\nAnyway, the real reason I came over here is because my buddy over there thinks you\u2019re pretty. Would you mind making his day and going over to talk to him?\nDANIELLE\nIs he shy or something?\nBrown comes up behind them and then sits down next to them.\nBROWN\nContrary to what my friend here would have you believe, I can very well speak for myself.\nDANIELLE\nOk\u2026\nBROWN\nDave Brown, I\u2019ve seen you around here a lot but we\u2019ve never formally met.\nHe shakes Danielle\u2019s hand.\nBROWN\nYou\u2019re\u2026\nDANIELLE\nDanielle.\nBROWN\nYes, I mean I\u2019ve heard a lot about you and seen you a lot here and there.\nDANIELLE\nIs that so?\nBROWN\nYeah, I\u2019m pretty much here every week.\nDANIELLE\nIt\u2019s funny because we both are here a lot but we\u2019ve never met, at least from what I remember.\nMiller gets up from the table and leaves to go somewhere else.\nMILLER\nSeems as if you\u2019ve got it under control from here.\nBROWN\nAs I was saying, I think we have actually talked a few times but you know, it was brief.\nDANIELLE\nYeah, look, I don\u2019t really remember....\nBROWN\nYou know, I can't remember waking up this morning. Do you think that means that I'm dreaming? (Brown smirks, and raises his eyebrow suggestively)\nDANIELLE\n(Danielle starts to crack a smile, and laughs) Maybe, haha.\nYou actually seem like a nice guy.\nBROWN\nHit what I was aiming for.\n(Brown looks away slightly, as to play off what he just said, as if nothing)\nDANIELLE\nWhere do you work?\nBROWN\nI'm in with this local organization. The Invisible Hand, we're really raking in the dough. I can't complain.\nDANIELLE\nYeah?\n(Danielle grows slightly more interested)\nBROWN\nAt the moment, life isn't getting much better than this. The American dream: the money, the cars, the clothes. It's fucking awesome.\n(\"Successful\" by Trey Songz is playing in the background)\nDANIELLE\nImpressive, you\u2019re making quite a living for yourself.\nBROWN\nYeah, things have been improving, really. (Brown takes his drink, and finishes it as to ease a bit of the tension) How about you? Where do you work?\nDANIELLE\nEh, I work at the local salon. Pretty nice place, I inherited a lot of the money so I could open my own and business is going really well.\nBROWN\nOh yeah (Brown snaps his finger, as to reassure his memory), I heard about that. Congrats.\nDANIELLE\nThanks. Well, I gotta get going. Would you mind walking me home?\nBROWN\nNo, not at all.\nBrown walks out with Danielle, while nodding to each of his friends, very pleased.\nThe camera pans to another side of the club, where Davis and Wilson are socializing with a lot of other people. Suddenly, Davis notices something out of the corner of his eye and just pauses. In comes the most beautiful girl he\u2019s ever seen in his entire life. He goes over to talk to her.\nDAVIS\nExcuse me, but I just wanted to introduce myself.\nThe girl smiles and gives him a handshake.\nGIRL\nJulia.\nDAVIS\nDavis.\nJULIA\nNice to meet you, Davis.\nDAVIS\nNice to meet you, Julia.\nJULIA\nSo what brings you here?\nDAVIS\nAh nothing, we go here every week, my buddies and I. We\u2019re in this big business known as The Invisible Hand.\nJULIA\nAnd what do you do with The Invisible Hand?\nDAVIS\nWell, it\u2019s just a normal business like any other except we also are in association with this particular club as well as a chain of casinos.\nJULIA\nSounds charming.\nDAVIS\nYeah, it\u2019s pretty cool. What do you do?\nJULIA\nI\u2019m a reporter and broadcaster.\nDAVIS\nFor what company?\nJULIA\nWell, I\u2019m working for Sun Sports and reporting for the Tampa Bay Rays and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I just started broadcasting there, and beforehand I was writing for the Tampa Tribune.\nDAVIS\nThat's funny, cause I\u2019m what they call an avid sports aficionado. Big Bucs and Rays fan.\nJULIA\nWelcome to the party.\nDAVIS\nYou know you got it all, (Davis looks off into the distance with a faceless expression, and then looks back at her and chuckles) You\u2019re beautiful, successful, and you know your sports.\nJULIA\n(Julia spawns a sort of cocky, but also unsure expression on her face) You know, I appreciate that, but it's still just the beginning for me.\nDAVIS\nThat's amateur talk. You speak like a person who doesn't feel like they're gonna amount to the heights of their peers. You\u2019re fine. You know how I got to my position? Confidence. Faith. Ambition. Persistence. And each every one of them with just a modicum of pretentious snob.\nJULIA\nHmm. (Julia nods her head in understanding and takes of sip of her drink, due partially to being intimidated, and partially impressed) I'll be sure to remember that. (rearranges her position) You know what I like about you?\nDAVIS\nI can take a guess.\nJULIA\nYou seem genuine. You're not one of these bland characters who just claims \"I can do it\" or some other redundant statement. You talk like how it is. Life isn't just a big ride of  \"I think I can\". We've all been raised to be similar to a bunch of toddlers, just running around trying to reach the same level when it's not gonna happen. Not with that one and only \"supreme\" mentality. And you're just that sort of reality check everyone needs. You speak like a real man (Julia bites her lip in a provocative manner and enunciates \"like a real man\" in a flirtatious manner).\nDAVIS\n(Davis shrugs, and then smirks)\nThat is what I strive to be, after all.\nWilson taps Davis on the back.\nJulia shakes his hand as Davis introduces them to each other.\nDAVIS\nJulia, Wilson. Wilson, Julia.\nWILSON\nNice to meet you.\nJULIA\nNice to meet you.\nWILSON\nSo what\u2019s going on here?\nDAVIS\nJulia\u2019s a reporter and broadcaster for Sun Sports, she covers the Bucs and Rays.\nWILSON\n(Wilson smiles) Nice, you boarded the right ship.\nJULIA\nI was hoping I did. Thanks.\nWILSON\nYou, are one lucky gal. Davis is one of the most solid guys I know.\nJULIA\nHe looks like it.\nWILSON\nWell, I\u2019ll let you two alone. Nice to meet you.\nWilson leaves.\nDAVIS\nHe\u2019s a good guy, Wilson. One of my closest friends.\nJULIA\n(Julia nods her head)\nThe camera pans to the back of the club. Smith sits down across from the big time casino owner, Matt Paul, as they shake hands.\nSMITH\nWhat can I do for you today, Mr. Paul?\nPAUL\nI wanted to talk a bit about the terms of our partnership.\nSMITH\nAnything wrong?\nPAUL\nOh no, I just want to clear everything up before our next casino opens.\nSMITH\nOk, fair enough.\nPAUL\nAlright, well I\u2019ve grown increasingly, suspicious, of some of the members of your crew.\nSMITH\nMatt, I can assure you\u2026\nPAUL\nHold on a second, Smith.\nSMITH\nWho in particular?\nPAUL\nGraham is a wild card. You know that, I know that. The guy clearly has his own intentions.\n(Just as Paul says that, Graham is seen exiting with two supermodels.)\nSMITH\nYou think? (Smith points back to Graham with the supermodels, both Smith and Paul laugh shortly). But that came with bringing him on board, I know the guys I work with.\nPAUL\nI\u2019m telling you, this guy is an instigator. He's more of a liability than a true partner.\nSMITH\nYou clearly don't know of the use he has for us. And if anything, Graham can be set in line when he needs to be.\nPAUL\nAlright bear with me here, my proposition is this: if this Graham character, or maybe even the youngster, does something stupid, I need to confirm where exactly each of your loyalties lie. Don't make me rely on conjecture, Smith.\nSMITH\nLook, look, look, enough with the politics alright. I'm not into any of that bullshit. That's coward's play. I don't favor nobody, Graham knows that, Brown knows that, and you should fucking know better too, Paul.\nPAUL\nYeah, but if it-\nSMITH\n(Smith interrupts Paul) Not trying to start something, but you do know that cop on your payroll pretty well don't you? Huh buddy? (Smith taps Paul's shoulder to bug him)\nPAUL\nYeah, alright look I see where you're getting at. Listen to me. I\u2019ll worry about my business\u2026\nSMITH\nAnd you let me worry about mine. With all due respect, if we're done here\u2026\nPAUL\nI never got an answer.\nSMITH\nSorry, but I'm gonna have to end the discussion here. Gossip, just sparks feuds, Paul my naive friend. And then to try to start it with the people I work with? and more importantly, when the people that I work with happen to be my friends? I'm just trying to play big brother to the pack... It's a bad call man.\nPAUL\n(Paul sighs in annoyance, but with also a hint of comprehension)\nI see.\nSMITH\nI just wanna have good business, think about it from that aspect. Take it easy, Matt.\nSmith walks away.\nCut to Danielle\u2019s house, where Brown and Danielle are passionately making out and then go into another room.\nCut to the boardwalk, where Davis and Julia are walking.\nDAVIS\nYou know, all my life, I was the guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now I feel like I\u2019m in the moment and I can actually be who I am.\nAfter a brief moment, he stops.\nDAVIS\nYou know, you\u2019re the first person I ever felt like I could fully speak my mind to.\nJULIA\nWhat about your friends and The Invisible Hand?\nDAVIS\nYou see, we're close pals and we do everything together, but there's a certain limit on what goes around with them. (Davis caresses Julia's her and looks into her eyes) I feel like I can just stop being such a \"manly man\" for once when I'm with you, and I can just open up. You know what I mean?\nJULIA\nOh, definitely (Julia begins to gaze back into Davis' eyes). I can't even begin to tell you.\nDAVIS\nSeriously?\nJULIA\nNot a doubt in my mind.\nDAVIS\nI can bet a lot of guys have chased after you, haven't they?\nJULIA\nYou see, here\u2019s the thing with that. Sure, I\u2019ve gone out with a few here and there but you are the first person I feel \u2018gets it\u2019. I don\u2019t know, is it wrong, because we\u2019ve only known each other for a few hours?\nDAVIS\nThere are no rules, baby.\nJULIA\nI don\u2019t know, my whole life, I\u2019ve been searching for that person, that would \u2018get it\u2019, that would understand me.\nDAVIS\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't either.\nJULIA\nNot even a day, and I've already fallen.\nDAVIS\nLet me catch you.\nJULIA\n(Julia laughs)\nDAVIS\n(Davis laughs embarrassingly)\nI'm sorry, that was a bit corny.\nJULIA\nIt's ok. (Julia smiles subtly at him, and then they slowly move in towards each other to start kissing slowly)\n(Julia and Davis start making out on the boardwalk, and then look out at the waves.\nCut to a coffee store. Wilson walks up to a table where a woman is at and sits down across from her.)\nWILSON\nA coffee store? That isn\u2019t cliched at all! Glad we\u2019re thinking outside the box, Claire!\n(Both of them share a laugh, and after a bit get serious, but casual not intense.)\nWILSON\nSo I\u2019m assuming your husband is busy right now?\nCLAIRE\nYou tell me, you were with him.\nWILSON\nI saw him leaving with two blonde supermodels.\n(Claire sighs and looks frustrated.)\nWILSON\nForgive me if I overstep my boundaries here, but why do you stick with this guy?\nCLAIRE\nI like challenges.\nWILSON\nI don\u2019t exactly know if that\u2019s a legitimate reason.\nCLAIRE\nHe\u2019s your friend and associate, as well.\nWILSON\nDoes that mean I have to like the guy?\nClaire looks stressed.\nWILSON\nI\u2019m sorry to talk down about your husband, but come on now, Claire. You know what he does and the type of guy he is.\nCLAIRE\nLet me ask you something, in my position what would you do?\nWILSON\nLook, I don\u2019t know what you see in your husband that makes you stick around and be taken advantage of like this. I know there\u2019s a lot of other people that care about you.\nCLAIRE\nLike who?\nWILSON\nClaire, if I don\u2019t care about you, why would I be here in the first place?\nCLAIRE\nI don\u2019t know.\nWILSON\nYou do what you want. I\u2019m just telling you my perspective.\nCLAIRE\nYou\u2019re a good friend, Dan. That\u2019s why I like talking like this. I don\u2019t want to make it seem like I don\u2019t appreciate having you there, because I really do. To be honest, I know you have better things to do with your time than listen to me vent about stuff.\nWILSON\nLike what? Go clubbing? Go watch TV? Go to sports events? What? Let me tell you something, there\u2019s no place in the world I\u2019d rather be right now, even if we are at a coffee store.\nCLAIRE\nYou mean it?\nWILSON\nLook at me.\nCut to Danielle\u2019s apartment.\nUnderneath the covers, Brown is having sex with Danielle. After it\u2019s over, both are exhausted. Danielle gets up, completely naked, and walks over to check her phone, as Brown watches her. Suddenly there\u2019s a knock on the door.\nDANIELLE\nI\u2019ll get it.\nDanielle throws on a shirt and answers the door. It\u2019s Miller.\nDANIELLE\nHow the fuck did he find this place? Did you give him the address?\nMILLER\nNo, actually it\u2019s a block away from the club and I saw you two walk inside.\nDANIELLE\nWhat the fuck gave you the idea it would be ok to just walk over?\nMILLER\nI\u2019m not the one who opened the door, first of all. And I've been meaning to ask, how does it feel like to have a stick up your ass all the time? Must've had real trouble walking to the fucking door, it seems like.\n(Brown, who\u2019s wearing shorts, immediately gets up from the bed aggressively.)\nBROWN\nHey, what the fuck?\nMILLER\nBrown, sit the fuck down. You can't think straight after you've been in the sack. (Miller looks at Danielle, scratches his chin and points back to Brown) This fucking guy, hehe...\nDANIELLE\nYou can march your ass right out that door where you came from! Whatever the fuck is going on (she waves her finger at both of them irritatingly) here, it's not my problem!\nMILLER\nThen you should\u2019ve ignored the door and kept blowing DB.\nDANIELLE\nDB?\nMILLER\nDick boy over here.\nBROWN\nDave Brown. Don\u2019t listen to him.\nMiller turns to Brown.\nMILLER\nYou're an imbecile, you know that?\nBROWN\nThe fuck are you on about again, Miller?\nMILLER\n(signals at Brown, lifts his index finger)\nCome, come, this is important.\nBROWN\nWhat the hell's the matter?\nMILLER\nIt\u2019s urgent, now come on. You mind if we occupy the other room for a quick interlude? And then Dave can go back to being an idiot.\nDANIELLE\n(sarcastically) Oh no! Feel free, it's absolutely fine. Take your time.\nMILLER\n(Miller smirks arrogantly at Danielle)\nI knew I was wrong about you.\n(Danielle sighs and rolls her eyes, but seems to buy Miller's sarcasm)\nBROWN\n(Miller and Brown walk to the other room and close the door)\nWhat was so damn crucial that you had to come and interrupt my session with that?!? (Brown points to Danielle through the wall)\nI mean did you see that? That shirt wasn't hiding anything.\nMILLER\nHey! (Miller snaps his finger multiple times next to Brown's head) Look at the business you're in, for christ's sake, I thought you'd be more intelligent. More aware, more mindful!\nBROWN\nAre you calling her a threat? Elaborate Miller, I'm not gonna get your point speaking in riddles all day.\nMILLER\nYou need something simpler than riddles, mate? Just take a good, quick look at the girl. She is fucking full of it, the way she talks, the way she looks at others, how she flaunts herself. Hell, even how she walks. It's like she wants every bloke to think they fancy her.\nBROWN\nLike I've asked so many times before Miller, WHAT are you on about?!?\nMILLER\n(Miller shakes Brown out of anger and impatience) Will you fucking listen to me?!?!? She's filling in for the role that she knows you want her to be. That's how she lures you in. And aside from some deep-seated plot she\u2019s probably hatched, she's a fucking woman. Not to mention, \"the woman of your dreams\".\nBROWN\nYou know you're actually pretty right there, Miller. I wanted her to at least be my girlfriend for the night, so she played that because she knew that was what I wanted. And also, she is a woman. I checked. And the woman of my dreams? I've never said that before. You're clearly over exaggerating a simple crush. But thank you so much for worrying about me Miller. (sarcastically) It means the world, budd-\nMILLER\n(Miller slaps Brown across the face before he could finish talking)\nYou fucking ungrateful little kid. Need to grow a pair, and start thinking like a grown man.\nBROWN\n(Brown touches where Miller slapped him, and then grows with rage as he starts to shove Brown, urging him to leave)\nGet out of my sight, Miller! Out! Out! You're not my fucking father!!\nMILLER\n(before Brown fully shoves him outside the room)\nYou're right I'm not 100% acting like a father figure right now- I'm also looking out for this goddamn business Brown! Remember I'm like the guidance fucking counselor but more physical-(pushes Brown off him, knocking him to the floor). (Miller, in a now louder voice tone) Now you do what you wanna do and fuck up your own life, I'm always gonna try to help but if I can't, then that's that. You pay your own reparations. But when you're probably putting the company at stake, I'm butting in, we all know that. (Miller, in a lower, but now frustrated tone) If she wants to use you, she'll want to use us. Don't act like some first day trainee.\nBROWN\n(Brown, now even irritated to the point of anger, looks at Miller with a face of complete hatred and gets up, and then swings the door open, and walks out. With Miller following him of course)\nGet the fuck out!\nMILLER\nI warned you. Don't be surprised when you get a bill-\nBROWN\nKeep it to yourself you fucking ape!\nMILLER\n(Miller proceeds to walk out, but at the last step turns around to face Brown with a face of disappointment)\nYou always let them control you and control you. (starts to walk away into the street and nods his head) It's for your own good, man.\nDANIELLE\nAnd don't even think about coming back around here, you heard?\n(Miller ignores her, with his hands in his pockets and his head down in disapproval, just walking into the street)\nBROWN\n(Brown has a visible look of sadness and regret on his face)\nI gotta go. I'm gonna get ready. (Brown picks up and puts on his clothes in a rather mopey fashion)\nDANIELLE\nOk.\nBROWN\n(Brown finishes putting on his clothes, then picks up 3 condom wrappers and throws them out in the garbage, Danielle looks at him while he's doing this, and raises her eyebrows at him in an emotionless manner)\nI guess I'll see you around, then.\nDANIELLE\n(Danielle grabs Brown fiercely by the face and tongues him passionately and then pulls away quickly)\nI guess I will. (Danielle smiles, but in a manner that throws off the audience's stance on her true intentions and purpose)\nBROWN\nMost definitely. (Brown smiles as he is leaving Danielle's house, in a way concluding that he feels proud of what he had just done, partially recovered over what Miller told him, while also feeling that he had just proved him wrong)\nBrown walks off into the rainy streets, with his head held high, and then stops to hail a taxi.\nCut to Graham\u2019s house, which is huge and luxurious. Wilson and Claire walk in. Claire turns on the lights and they walk upstairs, slowly. They open the door to the bedroom and see Graham, with his shirt unbuttoned and shorts on sitting on the bed asleep with the two blonde girls, who are naked.\nClaire looks over to Wilson, about to break down, but Wilson stands firm.\nWILSON\nYou do it, or I will.\nClaire slowly closes the door and then reopens it, which wakes everyone up. Graham is really surprised.\nGRAHAM\nClaire! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be home so early!\nCLAIRE\nIt is still my house, isn\u2019t it?\nGRAHAM\nSure it is.\nCLAIRE\nWhat are these two whores doing naked on our bed?\nGRAHAM\nFirst of all, they aren\u2019t whores, they\u2019re two very nice girls.\nCLAIRE\nThey\u2019re whores, John. What kind of women shack up with a married man? Do you have any idea?\nGRAHAM\nOk, and what are you doing with that guy at the door?\nWilson walks into the room, which surprises Claire.\nCLAIRE\nDan, go back, please!\nGRAHAM\nDanny?!?!\nWILSON\nI\u2019m not having sex with your wife behind her back like you\u2019re doing to her, even though I probably should because well, (laughs) How ironic would that be, am I right?\nGRAHAM\nClaire, you\u2019ve been seeing Wilson behind my back?\nCLAIRE\nNo, we\u2019ve just been talking.\nWILSON\nNothing intimate at all, unlike your, uhmm, little situation over here. We're not even going out.\nGRAHAM\nThen why did you just admit you wanted to fuck her?\nWILSON\nAhh, you weren't paying attention. I said that I SHOULD'VE had sex with her, because it would've actually done you some justice. I didn't say that I wanted to.\nGRAHAM\nSo you're trying to turn my own wife against me? Get her to Wilson's side right?\nWILSON\nI\u2019m not trying to fucking do anything! You\u2019re the one bouncing around from broad to broad, living like a single man when you're not. Poor Claire has to be the one in the neglected wife position and put up with your shit.\nGRAHAM\nClaire, do you have feelings for this prick?\nCLAIRE\nJohn, I can't think right now. Not with all that's going on.\nGRAHAM\nIt's such an easy question to answer. Just a stupid fucking question. Do. You. Have. Feelings. For. This. Asshole?\nCLAIRE\nI don\u2019t know what I feel! I can't think I need space to breathe! (Claire starts to panic, gripping her chest, falling to the floor while hyperventilating and crying)\nGRAHAM\nSon of a bitch!\nWILSON\nAt least you got that part right, Graham! Hey! We found some middle ground. Finally, for once!!!!\nGRAHAM\nGet out of my house!\nCLAIRE\n(while sobbing)\nDan, p-p-please! Just f-for now!\nWILSON\nI\u2019m not leaving without you.\nCLAIRE\n(sniffs and wipes away a tear)\nPlease, Dan.\nGraham gets up from the bed and goes into his drawer.\nGRAHAM\n30 seconds, is what you got to bite the bullet. Or bullets. What's it gonna be Danny?\nCLAIRE\n(yelling while crying)\nPlease!!!\nWILSON\nI can't leave you here to this, this, this torture, Claire.\nGRAHAM\nYou find a rabbit\u2019s foot today. I can't find my gun, and that makes you a real lucky man. But you're still not that lucky, and I'll still hurt you if you don't leave.\nClaire keeps trying to shove Wilson away, but he stands firm.\nFinally, Graham comes over and starts wrestling Wilson, causing Claire to scream. He punches Wilson a few times, kicks him in the stomach, and uppercuts him in the face. Wilson falls to the ground as Graham keeps kicking him.\nGRAHAM\nStay the fuck away from my wife!\nHe kicks Wilson one more time and then slams the door closed.\nClaire starts sobbing uncontrollably, as she sees Wilson on the ground, all bruised and banged up. Wilson struggles to get up and Claire quickly comes to his aid and helps him down the stairs and out the door. Wilson refuses her help but Claire insists.\nWILSON\nI don\u2019t need any more help from here on out. Go be with your husband.\nCLAIRE\nNo, I\u2019m staying here and helping you out.\nShe helps him inside the car.\nCut to the hospital, where Claire is calm, sitting next to the patient Wilson, holding his hand and trying to reassure him that things are alright. Williams walks in the room.\nWILLIAMS\nIs everything alright?\nCLAIRE\nHe\u2019s doing alright now.\nWILLIAMS\nYou hanging in there, Wilson?\nWilson looks and barely nods.\nCut to outside the hospital room, where Williams is calling Smith.\nSMITH\n(Yawns, and then rubs his eyes) What's going on Jay? What's this about, man?\nWILLIAMS\nSmith, we\u2019ve got an emergency. Wilson\u2019s in the hospital, they banged the guy up, and bad.\nSMITH\nJesus, fuck- How bad? (Smith gets up from his bed and becomes more alert) Can the guy stand?\nWILLIAMS\nIf he can, it'd be incredibly painful to do so. Broken nose, broken jaw, broken arm, broken rib.\nSMITH\nWell, what was the poor sap up to?\nWILLIAMS\nHe was hanging out with Graham\u2019s wife so he got beat to a pulp.\nSMITH\nHanging out? As in you know \"hanging out\"?\nWILLIAMS\nNo, I don't think so at least. From what they say.... and it doesn't seem like it to me. And Wilson just doesn't exactly... how do I say this?\nSMITH\nStrike you as the kind of guy who just has sex with the wives of his fellow co workers? I know. I was just making sure. Wanted some more reassurance.\nWILLIAMS\nPerfectly stated.\nSMITH\nAnd accurate. Jay, I want you to let me handle this.\nCut to Graham\u2019s house. There\u2019s knocking at the door.\nUpstairs, Graham gets up and goes downstairs, very annoyed.\nGRAHAM\nDon't know when the fuck to give up!\nHe opens the door and is shocked to see it\u2019s Smith. And then he proceeds to compose himself as if he were not in a blistered mood beforehand.\nGRAHAM\nSmith, How's.. things?\nSMITH\nThings are great, Graham. Spare me a minute (Smith looks around at Graham's house and steps a foot inside)?\nGRAHAM\nYeah, of course, come in.\nHe opens the door fully, and lets Smith inside and brings him into the kitchen.\nGRAHAM\nCoffee?\nSMITH\n(shakes his head)\nGRAHAM\nYou want some pizza? Got leftovers from tonight, if you want some.\nSMITH\nNo, no, I'm good Graham. Just the time. Thanks for the offer though.\nGraham sits down.\nSMITH\nSo I was in the middle of my beauty sleep, when I apparently had to be woken up. And you know how despicable I get when somebody doesn't let me rest. I can't function well enough without a proper, undisturbed sleep.\nGRAHAM\nYeah, yeah we know, Smith, with all respect. But what happened that was so important? Something about the casinos?\nSMITH\nNothing like that. It was even worse. This was real trouble. Inside The Invisible Hand.\nGRAHAM\nWell shit Smith, what is it??\nSMITH\nBack to me losing sleep...\nGRAHAM\nOk.\nSMITH\nI lose a bit of function. AND it kind of sets me on edge, too.\nGRAHAM\nAnother valid point taken, Smith.\nSMITH\nIs it? You think it's valid?\nGraham seems confused.\nSMITH\nYou see, they told me apparently some asshole put our good friend Danny Will in the hospital.\nSmith looks for signs in Graham\u2019s face, but Graham remains silent.\nSMITH\nBroken nose, broken jaw, broken arm, broken rib. Who ever did this got him real good. Quite the beating he got. Whoever did it seems like they get pissed off pretty easily.\nGRAHAM\nI mean the guy must have gotten mad for a reas-\nSMITH\nOh, come on Graham. You can't bullshit me.\nGRAHAM\nSmith, I think the idea you're getti-\nSMITH\nQuit acting so surprised. Save me the time.\nGRAHAM\nI\u2026\nSMITH\nI\u2019m a very impatient person, in case you\u2019re unaware. And you know you shouldn't be unaware. You know I don't like that. That makes me impatient.\nGRAHAM\nOk, I\u2019m sure if your wife was with another guy, you\u2019d be pretty pissed off as well.\nSMITH\nWhy in the fuck would you even care? Huh? I'm always hearing a \"Smith, this girl is fucking sexy\", or a \"Smith, this girl last night...\", \"Smith, the shit this girl did..\" \"Smith, I'm telling you this girl is this and that\"\nGRAHAM\nI get it. Jesus. You know, why do you even care?\nSmith snickers.\nSMITH\nYou\u2019re not making a very good case for yourself, John, you should be aware of that, and I\u2019m sure you are.\nAnd by the way, nothing was happening between the both of them, in case you\u2019re so concerned, which I have no clue why you would be. You know, all of your stuff can be psychologically draining. Danny\u2019s a nice guy, and he didn\u2019t get with your wife out of respect for you. You should take notes on the fucking guy. So I ask again, why\u2019d you do it?\nGRAHAM\nHey! Look Smith, I already...\nSmith slams Graham\u2019s head on the table and then trips Graham causing him to fall over. He keeps kicking Graham in the stomach.\nSMITH\nGet up! Get your ass up!\nSmith gives Graham to get up, and then punches him across the face.\nSMITH\nSpoiled ass motherfucker!\nHe grabs Graham\u2019s shirt and picks him up a bit and punches him in the face again.\nSMITH\nDon\u2019t ever try to fuck anybody over again, unless I tell you to! Is that clear?!\nGRAHAM\nYes.\nSMITH\nIs that clear?!\nGRAHAM\nYes!!!!\nSMITH\nWhat?!?!?\nGRAHAM\nLoud and clear sir!!!\nSMITH\n(Looks at his shirt and fixes his tie)\nIt better be, or our agreement will end as abruptly as the last men who worked for me who tried the same shit you did! I'll fucking bury you if the circumstances ask for it. Don't fucking test me, John!!\nHe puts his foot on Graham.\nSMITH\n(with his foot still on Graham, while Graham is gasping for breath and coughing harshly) I\u2019m trying so hard to keep you onboard, and this is what you put me through. Always some nonsense after the next. Don\u2019t insult my intelligence again! I\u2019m the only one sticking up for you, you fucking dumb prick!\nSmith reforms himself and gets a small cup and pours some coffee into it. He drinks it, throws it empty cup onto the floor, and then leaves.\n\nFade out.\n\nCut to a scene inside of a big apartment with high ceilings, the scenery is bright and very inviting. It\u2019s mid afternoon, the day after. The patio is beautiful and everything seems to be organized, in tip-top shape.\nBrown is on the couch, staring at the television set. But he's not looking at it. He's thinking. And he's thinking very critically. His closest female friend, Simmons, Clara Simmons, is in the kitchen setting up coffee for the both of them\nCLARA\n(starting coffee machine)\nYou want sugar? Cream?\nBROWN\n(Brown remains quiet)\nCLARA\nDavid?\nBROWN\nHuh?\nCLARA\nDave, is everything fine?\nBROWN\nYeah, things are pretty great as of late.\nCLARA\nAs of late?\nBROWN\nMeaning since recently.\nCLARA\nSo before recent times, things were terrible?\nBROWN\nKathy-\nCLARA\nI\u2019m just putting two and two together, Dave.\nBROWN\nStop pressing me! Jesus christ! Always with the questions, and the interrogations. I\u2019m an open and shut case, Lara.\nCLARA\nIf you say so.\nBROWN\nAnd what the hell does a guy have to do to get a goddamn coffee around here, huh?\nCLARA\n(Clara chuckles, finishes making the coffee and hands it to Brown. She gives him time to simmer down, but Brown quickly sputters off after a few sips. This, of course, enunciating the amount of depth, and trust in their relationship)\nBROWN\nKath.\nCLARA\n(Clara looks up from her coffee at him)\nBROWN\nDo you think I let people walk around me?\nCLARA\n(Clara looks at him in a befuddled manner, with an inkling of annoyance)\nDave, if the reason behind having a \u201cgreat as of recent\u201d mood, whatever the fuck that means, is because of some of those jerks you work with again\u2026\nBROWN\nNo, no, no. It\u2019s nothing like that. Completely different this time.\nCLARA\n(she sits down right next to him, enticed as to what the details are of his predicament)\nContinue.\nBROWN\n.....\nCLARA\nDavey! You know you can trust me!\n(puts her hand on his shoulder)\nBROWN\nOk, ok, here goes.\nCLARA\n(Clara nods her head)\nBROWN\nSo you know that club that I always go to? With the guys?\n(as he recounts the story, we see a flashback of the scene, but with more vivid details, as well as extended focus on important aspects, aspects that will prove to make perfect sense later on)\nCLARA\nYeah, I remember that place.\nBROWN\nAlright, so I was there, and I was having a drink with Mills, and well you know how Mills is.\nCLARA\nHe's the one who's a complete asshole right?\nBROWN\nComplete asshole? Alright, well I don't know if that term can really apply here but....\nCLARA\nOh, come on, if it's who I'm thinking of, what else do you call a guy who cons his way through life and cheats on his wife without stopping for a moment to think about the damage he's caused? The outcome of it all? He's so selfish- (As Clara is getting emotionally invested into her rant, Brown interrupts her)\nBROWN\nKathy, Kathy, It's not him. That's Graham.\nCLARA\nOh yeah, Graham. That was his name. I'm sorry for cutting you off, keep going.\nBROWN\nAlright, so I'm getting drinks with Miller just enjoying myself, talking typical guy bullshit, when this girl walks in. Drop dead gorgeous.\nCLARA\n(Clara looks at him with a \"So you liked herrrrr\" smile)\nBROWN\nI notice her first, and I really start to pay attention to her. Partially through no will of my own. She was just that attractive. So, I think that a girl like this is obviously gonna get guys all over her left and right, and she'll probably find someone before I talk to her, right?\nCLARA\nRight.\nBROWN\nSurprisingly, not that many guys go up to her. But a couple do, at least the ones that seemed to muster up the courage. Here's what really caught me though, she flat out rejected all of them.\nCLARA\nShe didn't even give them a chance?\nBROWN\nNo, no, she actually talked with all of them. And even looked like she was being friendly. And inviting. But nope, it all just extended to friendliness that day for her,\nCLARA\n(in a higher tone of voice, sounding like a narrator)\nUntil the handsome young David approached the damsel in distress, and tickled her fancy!-\nBROWN\n(Brown starts to crack a conspicuous little smile)\nCLARA\n(Clara smiles, seeing Dave partly in a better mood now)\nThere we go, a smile.\nBROWN\nSo fast forwarding to me meeting her, which was at the result of Mills being a bit of a dick. I'm talking to her, and what begins as this ordinary conversation actually manages to grow. And it seems like there's something charismatic about me, because she starts to become more attentive, and show interest in what we're talking about.\nCLARA\n(Clara readjusts her position to lie her head on his lap and lay on the couch, as if being told an interesting children's tale by her parents)\nBROWN\nSo we talk and talk, and I don't know what it was that I said, but next thing you know, I've been invited to her house. Still trying to figure out what it was exactly that I said so I can remember it for the following time. Anyways, we go in to her house, and she gets busy, real quick.\nBut what I was trying to piece together during the act, was the reason for why she was behaving, I don't know...\nCLARA\nPassive? Aggresive? Passive-Aggressive?\nBROWN\nA bit off. I couldn't exactly explain it, but I could sense that something in the moment was very wrong. I just struggled addressing the why. (Brown gets lost in his thoughts)\nCLARA\nOk, so after you guys did it, what happened?\nBROWN\nAhh yes, so I'm about to get ready, when I hear the door.\nCLARA\nHer boyfriend.\nBROWN\nToo clich\u00e9.\nCLARA\n(Clara chuckles and shakes her head)\nBROWN\nIt was Mills.\nCLARA\nGod, Mills is really starting to sound like a jerk....\nBROWN\nYeah, I couldn't believe it. He came in and basically ruined the atmosphere.\nCLARA\nI can imagine. I mean if somebody just decided to barge in right now, they'd ruin the vibe right now too. (3 seconds of awkward silence for Clara, and oblivion for Brown, while he is off still trying to unravel the events of the story in his head)\nYou know, cause I'm really interested in the story.\nBROWN\nSo, he pulls me aside, and tells me it's urgent. Then he had the audacity to basically call the girl an abomination.\nI mean he really, it might sound insane, but described this girl as some sort of a femme fatale. You know, like in the comics. She stalks her prey, lures them in, and then screws them over. And I mean, I know that Mills is just trying to look out for me. At least now I know. (Brown's facial expression starts to show regret, and guilt, and the scene starts to take a turn on the serious side) He was trying to tell me what was probably the truth but I neglected him. But then I completely regretted it as he was outside. Something he said. \"You always let them control you and control you\". Always controlling you. (Brown starts to go off into his own thoughts, and takes upon the image of guilt). Controlling and controlling.\nCLARA\nDavey, look. (Kathy shakes him to snap him out of the trance)\nBROWN\nControl you...... Always let them control you. (Has multiple flashbacks of being screwed over, each possibly due to a failure of thinking beforehand, and being manipulated)\nCLARA\nDave, stop!! Please you're scaring me!!\nBROWN\n(Brown bites his lower lip discreetly but also strongly, as to prevent himself from him tearing even slightly)\nCLARA\n(Kathy hugs Brown, and rubs his back with her left hand)\nIt's ok, Dave. Please, you're good here, just continue.\nBROWN\nI'm sorry, I got lost in my thoughts again. I just- I don't know, maybe he's right. He may be right. One of my closest friends just tried to look out for me. And on impulse, I just completely humiliated him in front of somebody else and kicked him out of the picture.\nCLARA\nI do admit that his reaction was uncalled for. He should've gave you the courtesy of tellig you afterwards, like an adult. But you have to hand it to him. He cares, Dave.\nDAVE\nDo you think he was right?\nCLARA\nI honestly don't know what to think. I don't even know whether to think good or bad of her rejecting all those other guys at the club. Sure at face value it makes her look respectable, but what game is she trying to play? I mean, how \"off\" was she acting exactly?\nDAVE\nWhen we were having sex (Kathy cringes in a very subtle way that is barely seen on screen), she seemed to be genuinely enjoying herself one second and then the next, pure silence. From frantic screaming to complete muteness.\nCLARA\nThat.... is kind of weird. I've never heard of something like that before.\nDAVE\nAnd it may seem like I'm already starting to look into it too much, but I started to notice when I looked into her eyes. It was as if something was off in her system. Her eyes spoke more to me than she ever did, or her body for that matter.\nCLARA\nWhat did you see, exactly?\nDAVE\nI saw some sort of pain.\n\n\nCut to the club, which is booming with the Big Sean, Drake, and Kanye West song \u2018Blessings\u2019.\nPaul walks up to Smith at the bar.\nPAUL\nHey, Smith, what\u2019s good man?\nSMITH\nBeen busy.\nPAUL\nApparently.\nSMITH\nWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\nPAUL\nThere\u2019s word coming from a few sources that there\u2019s some tension within your group.\nSMITH\n(concerned) What sources exactly?\nPAUL\n(ignoring the question and continuing) Come on, Smith, I mean\u2026\nSMITH\nListen, I don\u2019t know where you got that information from but I\u2019ll tell you what, we are fine.\nPAUL\nI\u2019m just worried about the business, man.\nSMITH\nYou see, Paul, one thing you gotta understand about me is that I\u2019m a very personal man. I like handling business on my own.\nPAUL\nAlright cool it, Smith. Just fix whatever is wrong.\nSMITH\nDon't you fucking tell me how to compose myself. And I will fix it.\nPAUL\nIt\u2019s just business, nothing personal.\nSMITH\nThen let me handle it on my fucking own! Jesus. (Smith downs his drink and gets up)\nSmith leaves angrily, after grabbing his jacket from the side.\nCut to the hotel conference room from the opening scene.\nSmith is pacing around the room, with Williams, Jones, and Miller seated in the room.\nMILLER\nSomebody's really fucking with our steelo, man. And the business is hurting.\nJONES\nLook at the numbers. There's a double agent. I knew somebody was stabbing us in the back. I just knew it. I could smell it every time we were in some sort of arrangement together. What really irks me is that I can't truly tell who's culpable. Personally, my bets are on Graham. The guy is a prick after all, and it's always the most obvious asshole out of all them.\nWILLIAMS\nYou\u2019re saying that cause you\u2019re biased towards him.\nJONES\nJust using some logic, Williams, you know? Something you never manage to use? Eh? and if I'm biased against the bastard so what? Bite me.\nSMITH\n(fed up) Shut up! Alright, look, here's the news fellas! It's time to get your fucking heads together before this operation starts to go down the shitter!\nWILLIAMS\nWe have any sort of plan yet?\nSMITH\nJones, Miller, I set up a meeting for you guys with Paul.\nMILLER\nGood cop, bad cop?\nSMITH\nSo to speak. You press this guy like some backstabbing motherfucker. Even if he might not be.\nJONES\nI\u2019m good with that.\nSMITH\nWilliams, you're paying a visit to Graham.\nWILLIAMS\nSounds good, boss.\nSMITH\nI\u2019ll gonna talk to Wilson in the hospital. Speaking of which, where are Davis and Brown?\nMILLER\nBoth are out\u2026\nJONES\nOut? Out where? Be straight with me Miller, you know I don't like ambiguity.\nMILLER\nThey\u2019re out with their respective \u2018women\u2019 (Miller looks saddened)\nJONES\n(jokingly) Looks like we all gotta grow the hell up every now and then.\nCut to Tropicana Field.\nJulia hurries Davis inside the stadium.\nDAVIS\nWhat\u2019s the rush?\nJULIA\nWe gotta get there in time for batting practice and everything, right?\nDAVIS\nSounds good to me.\nThey walk into the stadium and Julia leads Davis onto the field and stops him there.\nJULIA\nI need you to hold up for a moment.\nDAVIS\nDo what you gotta do, I\u2019m not stopping you.\nJulia heads into the dugouts, and into the underground room within the dugout while Davis takes it all in, getting almost teary eyed looking around.\nAfter a few moments, Julia returns eagerly.\nJULIA\nI think you\u2019re going to like this a lot.\nSuddenly, Davis watches as his two favorite players, third baseman Evan Longoria and starting pitcher Chris Archer walk over to him. He\u2019s in total shock, as a huge grin comes across his face. Julia looks at him, smiling as well.\nLongoria and Archer shake his hand.\nLONGORIA\nWhat\u2019s up?\nARCHER\nHow\u2019s it going?\nDAVIS\nHoly shit, man! Wow! (laughs a bit)\nJULIA\nI don\u2019t know guys, seems like Mr. Davis is a bit starstruck.\nLongoria and Archer laugh a bit.\nDAVIS\nI\u2019ve been following both of your careers. Longoria, with the rookie season in the World Series and Home Run Derby and that clutch game 162 walk off home run against the Yankees.\nLONGORIA\nHate the Yankees!\nDAVIS\nBest day of baseball I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\nLONGORIA\nBest day of baseball I\u2019ve ever played.\nARCHER\nMore to come.\nDAVIS\nAnd then Archer, and all the great pitching performances you\u2019ve had. Now, after David Price left, you\u2019re the ace of the staff.\nARCHER\nPretty big hole to fill.\nLONGORIA\nYou\u2019ll be great for years to come man, don\u2019t worry about it.\nARCHER\nNah, I\u2019m not worried. You see, part of being in the major leagues is the hard work and dedication that comes with each performance. It\u2019s about staying consistent.\nLONGORIA\nThe guys that always go for the incredible, SportsCenter type of play never really are considered great players. It\u2019s those that remain consistent that will be considered elite for years and years to come, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\nARCHER\nOf course, as you know, consistency isn\u2019t only for sports. I mean, we play a game for a living, we\u2019re very fortunate. We get paid to play the game we love. There\u2019s no better feeling in the world.\nLONGORIA\nDo what you love, love what you do.\nDAVIS\nDamn, that\u2019s some great advice. Some great tips of wisdom.\nARCHER\nHey, I mean we aren\u2019t philosophers. All you really gotta do is set aside time to chill out by yourself, ya know, completely relaxed. If you\u2019re still stressed even then, you have to reevaluate your life.\nLONGORIA\nYou\u2019re not doing things right.\nDAVIS\nI\u2019ll keep all of that into account. Thank you.\nARCHER\nWe have to get going, game time in an hour.\nDAVIS\nIt was nice to meet you guys.\nLONGORIA\nOur pleasure.\nDavis shakes their hands, as they head off back into the dugout.\nDavis looks at Julia, admiringly.\nDAVIS\nI love you.\nCut to the hospital.\nSmith knocks on the door.\nSMITH\nAnybody home?\nWILSON\n(sort of weak, but not really) Come in.\nSmith, smiling enters the room.\nSMITH\nHow we doing, buddy?\nWILSON\nWell, I\u2019ve been feeling better.\nSMITH\nStep in the right direction.\nWILSON\nShould be a day or two till they let me out.\nSMITH\nThat\u2019s great to hear, man. You\u2019ve been in here too long.\nWILSON\nTell me about it. I miss you guys.\nSMITH\nWe miss you, buddy.\nWILSON\nHow have the guys been?\nSMITH\n(a bit concerned) Let\u2019s say things are different.\nWILSON\nYeah?\nSMITH\nYeah. We found out there\u2019s a double agent amongst us.\nWILSON\nIt\u2019s Graham, we all know it.\nSMITH\nCan\u2019t just assume that stuff.\nWILSON\nThe guy is a scumbag.\nSMITH\nI know, and I\u2019ve dealt with him.\nWILSON\nGood. Anyway, what about this double agent?\nSMITH\nHe\u2019s working for Paul.\nWILSON\nAll I can tell you is that it isn\u2019t me.\nSMITH\n(smiling) We know, Wilson.\nCut to the club. Drake\u2019s \u20180 to 100/The Catch Up\u2019 is booming.\nJones and Miller walk up to Paul.\nJONES\nPaul, you have a moment?\nPaul looks over to the cop on the side and nods, as Jones and Miller follow him into a back room.\nThe door is closed after the cop, Drew Jackson, walks in and locks the door.\nPAUL\nSo, how can I help you gentlemen?\nJONES\nWe\u2019d like to know how exactly you obtained the information you did.\nPAUL\nPertaining to what?\nMILLER\nDamn it, Paul, you fucking know.\nPAUL\nAm I being threatened?\nJONES\nYou\u2019re not being threatened, we just have to know for obvious business reasons.\nPAUL\n(chuckling to himself) So he sent his lawyer and enforcer?\nJONES\nWe are going to you to confirm if this is a safe business agreement or not.\nJACKSON\nIf you\u2019ll excuse me for a second, Paul, what right do a bunch of criminals have to question how \u2018safe\u2019 a business transaction is? I mean, isn\u2019t that kind of ridiculous?\nMILLER\n(mockingly) Correction, officer. With all due respect, what\u2019s even more ridiculous is that a dirty, crooked cop is trying to determine what is legal and what isn\u2019t.\nJONES\nWe\u2019re just a regular business trying to make sure we are wisely investing in something. Tell me if I\u2019m wrong, Paul. You\u2019ve been in this business just as long as any of us have.\nPaul thinks to himself for a moment.\nPAUL\nTo be quite frank, if both sides really trusted in one another, why exactly would we be looking into your stuff and why would Smith show me the disrespect of having his lawyer and enforcer here? But I like that, I like that. (pauses for a moment) Shows that we\u2019re both legitimate, and serious in terms of doing business. However, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to break off our agreement.\nMILLER\nWhat the hell for?!\nPAUL\nYou see, I just simply don\u2019t trust The Invisible Hand enough to do business.\nJONES\nOh come on, Jake, that\u2019s bullshit and you know it!\nPAUL\nIs it, Jones? Put yourself in my shoes and tell me if you would react differently.\nJACKSON\nIt\u2019s a quite logical decision, you guys can\u2019t be seen doing business here, especially with a failing, collapsing, unstable organization such as The Invisible Hand.\nMiller gets angered by this and charges at Jackson, while Jones tries, to hold him back.\nPAUL\nI can\u2019t be bothered by this anymore. I have other things to attend to.\nHe leaves the room. Jones keeps trying to hold Miller back while trying to shut the door.\nMILLER\nYou fucking dirty piece of shit!\nJACKSON\nCome at me, big man!\nMiller finally gets a punch in on Jackson, after breaking free of Jones and starts overwhelming him with punches and kicks.\nJACKSON\nAssault of a police officer is one more thing you guys will have to worry about.\nMILLER\nA corrupt cop at that!\nJackson finally takes out a gun and shoots Miller three times in the chest, causing Miller to fall back dead. Jones is shocked by what just happened, as he sees his friend\u2019s limp body fall to the ground.\nJACKSON\n(putting his gun away) Got what was coming to him.\nJONES\nWhat the fuck?!\nJACKSON\nYou wanna try me?! Huh?! Working on a short fuse right now!\nJONES\nYou\u2019re a cop!!! You\u2019re supposed to stand for justice!!!\nJACKSON\nEasy for you to say. You\u2019re a lawyer. You\u2019re supposed to stand for the law. But you\u2019re just as dirty as the rest of them, a bunch of con artists.\nJONES\nYou don\u2019t realize what you\u2019ve just done!\nJACKSON\nMaybe. But it\u2019s your problem now.\nHe reforms himself and leaves the room, while Jones sits, shocked, with Miller\u2019s dead body.\nCut to that night. Davis takes Julia to a huge complex. The lights are dimly lit, and there\u2019s a crowd of people there.\nSuddenly, a soft, smooth beat starts playing. Everything goes dark. After a few brief moments, a spotlight is shown on a figure with a microphone in hand. It happens to be John Legend, who sings a soulful chorus. The beat becomes a bit more aggressive and everything goes dark. Abruptly, fireworks shoot out, and infrared lights are shown all over the stage as Drake comes on and raps a verse. This leads into a verse from Kendrick Lamar, who appears on stage with Drake. Then, Legend sings the chorus again. The lights go dim again as the beat becomes more of a melody. OneRepublic comes on stage to sing a verse, and then the lights go dim again. The melody turns into one that\u2019s more instrument oriented, as U2 come on stage to sing a verse. The song culminates in a more guitar oriented version of the beat, as Legend, Drake, Kendrick, OneRepublic, and U2 all appear on stage together before the lights go dim. The crowd roars with approval from the new song. After the song, Legend performs \u2018Green Light\u2019, \u2018Save Room\u2019, and \u2018Everybody Knows\u2019; Drake performs \u2018Forever\u2019, \u2018Headlines\u2019, and \u2018Lord Knows\u2019; Kendrick performs \u2018Swimming Pools\u2019, \u2018Money Trees\u2019, and \u2018i\u2019; OneRepublic performs \u2018Apologize\u2019, \u2018Good Life\u2019, and \u2018Counting Stars\u2019; and U2 performs \u2018Sunday Bloody Sunday\u2019, \u2018Beautiful Day\u2019, and \u2018Window in the Skies\u2019. The audiences roars with cheering.\nDavis then takes Julia backstage.\nJULIA\nWhere are we going?\nDAVIS\nYou\u2019ll see.\nAfter walking a bit down, they finally enter a conference room located off to the right.\nJulia is shocked to see Bono, Ryan Tedder, Drake, Kendrick, and John Legend all seated there. Davis closes the door behind him. Julia is almost brought to tears. Davis and her shake each of their hands.\nJULIA\nThis is just amazing. How were you able to do this?\nBONO\nYou\u2019re one lucky girl, I\u2019ll tell you that. You see, if it hadn\u2019t been for your friend Davis, this wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\nTEDDER\nI don\u2019t know about that, because, I mean, we\u2019re all good friends here.\nDAVIS\nYou certainly made great music out there.\nBONO\nWe appreciate that, took awhile. All great things come with time.\nKENDRICK\n(laughing) About to light up Billboard, the Grammys, and everything in between!\nEveryone has a good laugh.\nLEGEND\nAll proceeds from this concert went to different charities and cancer research, so rest assured, it was for a good cause.\nDRAKE\nI mean, I\u2019d be willing to do a whole tour with you guys, if you\u2019re down for it.\nKENDRICK\nI mean I\u2019d love to, but we each have different schedules in terms of our respective albums and stuff.\nJULIA\nYou guys sounded like you could make a whole collaborative album out there.\nDAVIS\nBest artists in the entire world.\nLEGEND\nYou really thought it was that great?\nJULIA\nSeriously, you guys were amazing.\nDRAKE\n(laughing a bit) Not to brag, but that was a kick ass concert. Probably the best I\u2019ve ever been to.\nDAVIS\nWho produced it?\nTEDDER\nWe worked with a number of different producers actually, I mean you have Danger Mouse, 40, Dr. Dre, Kanye West, and myself included all having a hand in this.\nBONO\nThe single should be due out on iTunes soon, all funds going to the charities John was speaking of.\nLEGEND\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I thought everything worked very organically and smoothly.\nDRAKE\nLegit, easiest time in the studio.\nKENDRICK\nThat\u2019s where the magic happens!\nCut to Julia\u2019s house. Davis drives up to it, with Julia in the passenger seat and stops in the driveway.\nJULIA\nToday was just amazing. Thank you.\nDAVIS\nThank you. Hands down the best day of my entire life.\nJULIA\n(looking concerned) Listen, I need to talk to you about something.\nDAVIS\n(looking concerned as well) What\u2019s wrong?\nJULIA\nI haven\u2019t been 100% with you the whole time.\nDAVIS\nWhat are you talking about? You\u2019ve been great.\nJULIA\nNo, no I haven\u2019t been. I\u2019ve been using you.\nDAVIS\nJulia that\u2019s absurd\u2026\nJULIA\nI\u2019ve been using you. I first met you because I was told to do so. I didn\u2019t really like you at first, but now I really do.\nDAVIS\nJulia\u2026\nJULIA\n(she starts tearing up, desperately trying to hold back tears and sniffeling) You gotta understand, I had a deal with a policeman but now it\u2019s over. It\u2019s done with. I\u2019m over it.\nDavis looks as though he was punched in the gut.\nJULIA\nThat isn\u2019t real. What is real is me and you. That\u2019s what\u2019s real.\nShe leans in to embrace Davis, but he resists.\nDAVIS\nGet out.\nJULIA\nI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\nDAVIS\nI\u2019m asking nicely, please leave.\nJULIA\nI love\u2026\nDAVIS\nDamn it, Julia, won\u2019t you get the fuck out?!\nHe turns to her, eyes glassed up, and wounded. Tears are streaming down her eyes as she nods and leaves. He drives away as she breaks down.\nHe stops on the side of the street a few blocks away and breaks down, slamming the wheel in anger as he sobs in his arms.\nCut to Graham\u2019s house.\nWilliams knocks on the door, and Claire answers.\nWILLIAMS\nIs he around?\nCLAIRE\nNo, and he won\u2019t be anymore.\nShe welcomes him inside.\nWILLIAMS\nI really should get going soon.\nCLAIRE\nWe\u2019re getting a divorce.\nWILLIAMS\n(surprised) Yeah?\nClaire shakes her head \u2018yes\u2019.\nWILLIAMS\nWell, good for you.\nCLAIRE\nHe\u2019s giving me the house and a few million to pay for it and for other stuff as well.\nWILLIAMS\nDo you have any idea where he could be?\nCLAIRE\nProbably the club, but he\u2019s calmed down a lot more after what happened.\nWILLIAMS\nThank you, Claire. I really appreciate it.\nCLAIRE\nAny word on Wilson?\nWILLIAMS\nProbably a day.\nWilliams gets a call and reaches into his pocket, and answers it.\nWILLIAMS\nYo Smith, what\u2019s up?\nWilliams looks extremely concerned, even sick.\nWILLIAMS\nI\u2019ll be there soon.\nHe puts his phone back in his pocket, slowly and turns to Claire.\nCLAIRE\nIs everything alright?\nWILLIAMS\nMiller\u2019s been found dead.\nCut to Brown\u2019s house, where he\u2019s making out with Danielle on the couch, putting his hand on and up her thigh. Suddenly, his phone starts ringing. He keeps going but soon breaks it up, with Danielle insisting. He answers his phone.\nBROWN\nKinda busy now. What\u2019s up?\nBrown looks increasingly concerned, and almost on the point of crying, like a hard punch to the gut. He puts his phone away and gets up, lightheaded, after rubbing his face a few times. He starts getting his things without a word, as Danielle follows him.\nDANIELLE\nWhat are you doing?\nBrown doesn\u2019t answer.\nDANIELLE\nIs anything wrong?\nHe still doesn\u2019t answer.\nDANIELLE\nAren\u2019t we gonna fuck?\nBROWN\nNo, Danielle, not today.\nDANIELLE\nWhy the fuck not?\nBROWN\nNot today, Danielle.\nDANIELLE\nWhat\u2019s your deal?\nBROWN\nDanielle, now\u2019s not the time.\nDANIELLE\nWhat, am I not good enough for you anymore?\nBROWN\nNow\u2019s not the time, Danielle.\nDANIELLE\nYou greedy, self obsessed two face fuck! I get it, let\u2019s fuck on your schedule!\nBROWN\nNow\u2019s not the time, Danielle!!! Now\u2019s not the fucking time!!!\nHe looks at her angrily.\nBROWN\nI don\u2019t know what the fuck was going on in my head. You have a great face, great body, great tits, great ass. We had some great sex. But you ain\u2019t nothing special outside of that.\nDANIELLE\nYou don\u2019t mean that!\nBROWN\nI do mean exactly that! And who the fuck are you to tell me how I think?! You barely even know me!\nDANIELLE\nYou\u2019re starting to act like that fucking square friend of yours!\nBrown aggressively stops and stares intensely at her.\nBROWN\nThat call I just got, do you know what that was for?\nDANIELLE\nSome stupid shit probably\u2026\nBROWN\nNo, that call was to tell me that this \u2018fucking square friend of mine\u2019 has been killed! Three fucking bullets through him! Do you comprehend that?!\nDanielle looks in shock.\nBROWN\nNo! All you fucking care about is your fucking diamond rings and your fancy dresses along with all the rest of your rich white girl bullshit! Who the fuck cares?!? We could keep fucking, but for what?! How the fuck exactly does that help me? (Brown closes in her with a vicious look, along with a completely cold glaze in her eyes, as his lip quivers uncontrollably as he insults her) I could find another nice little piece of meat just like you off the street and be completely fine with her. I'd be just fucking dandy with her. And then the next one, and the next one, and so on and so forth. You're just another one of \"them\". Hot little glossed up dolls asking to be roughed up, nothing less and nothing more. Because that's degrading enough. You're no better than those Gucci belts that you wear..... You're not any more useful than those Armani dresses you wear or those Chopard bracelets you sport during weekdays. I'd feel bad for you, Danielle, I truly, most sincerely would. But I can't pose sympathy that isn't even human.\nDanielle is speechless.\nBROWN\nMaybe one day it\u2019ll sink in, love.\nHe leaves and slams the door closed.\nCut to the club. Jones walks over to Graham, who has a black eye, his arm is in a sling, and he looks exhausted.\nJONES\nI just wanted to say\u2026\nGRAHAM\nDon\u2019t.\nJONES\nLook, I know we don't exactly compose ourselves when we're in the same room, but-\nGRAHAM\nStop. I\u2019m just gonna be honest with you, Jones. I have been dealing with a fuckload of priorities on my plate as of recent and I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to be able to sense your presence in the room. Why exactly? I can't stand who you are. So you can see yourself out.\nJONES\nThis is crucial, Graham, don't let personal boundaries get in the way of what's important. We need to discuss, regardless of whether you have a fucking boner for me or you dream of stabbing me in your sleep.\nGRAHAM\nI already told you. Don't be an asshole-Just please. (points at door with his hand)\nJONES\n(grabbing Graham\u2019s shoulder) Listen to me, listen to me. Can you fucking hear me? We've got worse dilemmas to fry at the moment. Which dilemmas exactly? Miller is dead. He's fucking dead. I witnessed it. Now you can sit here, jerking yourself off, stuffing your face, moping around about how things went down the shitter, or you can be a man and get off your ass. I'm not forcing you. I\u2019m ready and willing to go with the wind and let the past devolve on it's own.\nHe pats Graham on the back as he gets up.\nCut to the backroom, where cops and detectives and medical teams hover over the lifeless body of Miller. The camera looks around to each of them and then pans slowly up, as the police chief Wes Colti\u00e9r enters the room, and it zooms in slowly on him as his voiceover is overheard.\nCOLTI\u00c9R (V.O.)\nYou ever let yourself, just vibe and kick back, specially during the movies, only to let somebody completely surprise you?\n(Coltier smiles at the camera)\nColtier walks over and looks at the dead body. He picks up the gun right beside it.\nCOLTI\u00c9R\nI\u2019m assuming this is the murder weapon.\nHe looks at the medical team, who just nod obviously.\nCOLTI\u00c9R\n(sarcastically) Well, obviously...\nHe rolls his eyes and walks out of the room after being handed a report. Something catches his eye at the corner. It\u2019s Jackson, getting drinks.\nCOLTI\u00c9R\nWhere the hell have you been?\nJACKSON\nJust getting a drink.\nCOLTI\u00c9R\nThere\u2019s a dead guy in the back room, in case you\u2019re unaware. Get your ass back on the job.\nJACKSON\nLoud and clear, sir.\nCut to a meeting in The Invisible Hand\u2019s conference room. All the members are sitting down at a table, while Smith is up and walking around. Each of them are wondering what he\u2019s going to say next. Finally, he speaks up.\nSMITH\nListen, I don\u2019t know what the fuck happened. This is going way too far. Whatever bullshit vendettas you have against each other, it needs to stop.\nWILLIAMS\nWe need to start functioning as a unit.\nWILSON\nWell we didn\u2019t exactly have a problem until recently, at least in terms of what\u2019s been let out in the public eye.\nGRAHAM\nAlright, Wilson, I\u2019m sorry. About everything. I really am. My ego's sometimes a bit too much for people handle, it truly is, I've seen the toll it's taken on people. Then afterwards what exacerbates it is that I try too hard to compensate. I, overcompensate that is. That goes for the rest of you guys, I really apologize and I hope you'll forgive me. Whether I really have the will to change, I don't know. But I'm gonna start trying.\nWilson nods in understanding.\nAn enraged Brown stands up.\nBROWN\nI\u2019d like to know which of you fuckers killed Miller!\nJONES\nDave, calm it out man. Wasn't none of us, okay. It was that piece of shit cop on Paul\u2019s payroll. What's his name (snaps fingers to think)? uhmm, Jackson. Yeah, him. It was Jackson.\nBrown raises a gun to Jones\u2019 head with everyone else in the room shocked.\nBROWN\nYou're a fucking rat!! You're the one who put us here, huh?!? You're the one who's been fucking it all up for us!!\nJONES\nDave, my man, ju-just pull the gun down slowly. I was just there with him talking to Paul and the guy shot Miller after the deal broke down with Paul!\nBROWN\nSo you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been giving information to Paul?! It was you?! You're a fucking snitch!!\nJONES\nNo, damn it, Brown! Put the gun down, man!\nBrown points the gun at Graham now.\nBROWN\nYou\u2019re the biggest fraud in the room! And you're stupid enough to fuck it up. It\u2019s your fault, ah?!!? Answer me, you fuck!\nGRAHAM\nNo, I\u2019ve been getting a divorce\u2026\nBROWN\nAnd your life's been gone to shit cause you smacked the shit out of Wilson! You motherfucker!\nGRAHAM\nBrown, it\u2019s not...\nBrown pistol whips Graham in the face, causing a nose bleed.\nBROWN\nDon\u2019t fucking lie to me! Who the fuck was it?!\nDAVIS\nFor all we know, it could\u2019ve been you, look at you, you little fuck. Coming in here, pointing fingers while screaming like a little fucking girl. The fuck is wrong with you? Because maybe it was you. Maybe you're the one behind it all. And you just think if you look emotional and blame the world then you're gonna look the innocent. Well, your plan's failing.\nBrown points the gun at Davis.\nDAVIS\nYou\u2019ve been hanging around with that whore, haven\u2019t you been? She been inspiring you?\nBROWN\nHey where the fuck have you been Davis, enlighten me?\nDAVIS\nI\u2019ve been with a girl. A girl that just happened to screw me over.\nBROWN\nYou\u2019re not the fraud, you\u2019re just a hypocrite.\nBrown looks around the table.\nSMITH\nThis has to stop, Brown. I realize Miller was a father figure to you, and he\u2019s a great guy. Whoever did this shit is in this room, no doubt about that. And some day if we don't nab his ass, he'll come through with his wrongdoings.\nBROWN\nWhat is this, a fucking sermon?!?\nCan't you pricks heed the elements of our goddamn situation right now? Miller is 6 feet under. Our operations are going to shit. Everything is becoming less stable. And the most probable deduction? That it's all within the grasp of one deceptive man. Assuming we follow this theory, just tell me, why would the bastard come to me, in ANY day, and explain why he had to have one of us killed and basically ruin the way things were? He knows there never will be a time where he can expect me to just shrug it off. I'll strangle him. Show him what he gets for being such a fucking two faced backstabbing tool!\nSMITH\nBrown, calm your ass down. Seriously, come look. (Smith approaches Brown while Brown cringes in a paranoid fashion) Give me the gun, I don't want you to hurt someone who possibly is innocent just because you blew a fuse.\nBROWN\nOh, we're fucking far from innocence, Smith. Please, give a guy a break. Even the most \"innocent\" man in this wrong probably has killed around 5-7 guys. In this line of work that makes you a freaking angel. You should be able to see that, and out of all these people in the room. You can't seriously tell me that you're stuck in some delusional mafioso mentality where you see yourself as \"just another man doing his day's work, trying to get by.\" and that \"You don't intend for evil\". You got in this game knowing very well what you're up against, the level of the stakes, and the tasks and consequence that'll arise. Regarding us as anything close to saints is the equivalent of letting a child-molester priest continue preaching. That's the truth, that's the reality.\nSMITH\nYou little smart-ass. You're a real fucking punk, you know that? And just about who the hell do you think you are? I'm not just another one of your goddamn coworkers you can rub shoulders with and spar around with. Know your limits. And if you really wanna talk about \"innocence\" and \"reality\" and all these other newfound themes you seem to love all of sudden, let me enlighten you. Yes, I did step my foot in this game being completely aware of how it works. Yes, none of us are innocent in the eyes of the government, other people, or even the Lord himself. But in our group, in our business, my interpretation of the word innocent is much looser. Innocent is not stabbing one of your boys in the back, specifically us. Innocent is telling the truth when it's acknowledgement is necessary. Innocent, is unquestionable loyalty, and character. Basically, a model man for this business. So, if this model man strangles people, tortures them for intel, beats the livin shit out of them, and kills them, does it matter to me? No. The world's an ugly place, these things are bound to happen. You cross us, don't expect a formal letter with a complaint. And if you truly get us with our pants down, don't even pray that you'll just get a bit touched up. The ugly is necessary a lot of the time. It lacks appeal but wields true purpose and NEEDS to happen. You listening to me? Huh?\nBROWN\nYes sir, I got it.\nSMITH\nGood. And if you ever even start to talk to me like that again you're gonna wake up breathing through a fucking tube, like the rat in this room is gonna be once I find him. That is, if there is one.\nDAVIS\nWith all due respect sir-\nSMITH\nEnough. I'm tired of constantly being antagonized as if I were the rat. You wanna bark at each other like if you all were the rats and then snap at me when I try to cool your heads? I'm solely working for the best intentions of this company. I've etched my fucking mind, body, and soul into this business. And for what? To be hammered to the wall by my own men because of paranoia.\nDAVIS\nListen Boss, whether you like it or not, we're no longer just playing with the possibility of a traitor in the house. There is one, that is a given by now. So whether you want to keep treading lightly on a situation like this is up to you. Just know we won't be on your side if you do, and we will treat you as the traitor, as if you are one of them.\nBROWN\nHey, speak for yourself brother, I'm not fucking over Smith anytime soon. I know I went a little over the line, and ultimately Smith's points are all completely valid. Have some respect for somebody from higher up.\nDAVIS\nWhy don't you shut the hell up when I'm trying to talk to the boss, you Day 1 rookie fuck. Who in the fuck are you?\nSome prick who just grew too big for his britches, forgetting that he doesn't have any experience yet. Take it down a notch before you step in trying to flex supposed knowledge and \"wisdom\" before us.\nGRAHAM\nAnd I thought I was the prick before.\nBROWN\n(in a very harsh attitude) And I thought Williams was the middleman before. Go cry about your fucking wife, Graham.\nWILLIAMS\nWhat a piece of shit.\nGRAHAM\nYou're lucky I currently lack the energy to respond to that.\nWILLIAMS\nDamn straight. I'd smack the baby fat off of Brown for being the little wise-ass that he aims to be.\nDAVIS\nWilliams, you're starting to look real suspect, you know that? This whole time we're here grabbing each other by the necks, while you, are just kickin back there watching it all unfold. Does this please you?\nYou snitch fuck.\nBROWN\nThe snitch is always the one pointing fingers, calling others snitch. That's just common knowledge.\nDAVIS\nOkay, one, Brown that's trivial, I could easily say the same about you, calling you a rat because you're calling me that. To shift the blame off of you, so fuck off. and Two, back to what I addressed beforehand. Why can't you respond, huh? You got something to hide, Williams?  (gets close to face, ferociously) Being completely honest I never thought shit of you when you first arrived and I still don't, not even a bit. You've got the scent of a liar and a coward. And I could just tell by the look of your face you'd stoop low enough. Like a \"working for both sides, trying to annihilate one\" sort of low.\nWILLIAMS\nDavis, take the heart off of your sleeve and talk like a man who has his head in the right place. You're sheepish, and an idiot. Can't you see what's going on? Whoever the fuck set this up intended for all of this. He knows once he makes his presence known enough he'll drive you all onto the brink of instability. And then that's when he'll commence to hit. Although he's an enemy, I have to admit: brilliant plan. He's attempting to get us to pick off each other while he lamps in the back, just observing it all decay until he fully gains his power back. Why don't I cause as much a commotion or a scene as you guys? I'm not weak. I don't think it's getting anywhere. And lastly, we're feeding him. We're feeding him progress in his plans and we're feeding his ego, along with any other sort of benefit or satisfaction he derives from all of this. He's observing every single move that you make. The more you talk, the closer he gets to winning. So, just shut it, for the sake of this business and for the sake of my sanity as well.\nBROWN\nSounds like some wacko conspiracy theory you'd read about on youtube that's way too contrived. You better get your head out of those movies and shows you've been watching, man.\nDAVIS\nIronic, since the trend of conspiracies mostly stems from your generation. Then the excess television and movies show revolving around crime, well that's your generation too.\nBROWN\nAnd who's to say we were all involved in that sort of mediocre mentality? What's become of you? You've turned into a fucking prick who thinks he can just leap from A to B and come to a conclusion about everything. I get it, you're tired, you've had it, and you are just about up to here. You've become stubborn as you've aged, oh is that it? You too old to do your damn job? Maybe you should retire. They say entirely all old guys pertaining to this line of work generally are too selfish and reluctant to quit. So in acting this way, they just dampen productivity for everybody working around them. Maybe you should just throw in the towel before you fuck this all up for everybody. I mean you're bound to do just that. Why not do us a favor and spare us the inconvenience? We don't wanna prepare for your fuck-ups.\nDAVIS\nI'm not too old to do what I do best, you hothead son of a bitch!\nBROWN\nAnd I'm not too young to do this fucking jig either old man!!\nDAVIS\n(Davis breathes due to the energy used in yelling as his facial expression changes, showcasing him realizing his errors. As he concludes his ignorance, he takes a gulp and steps back)\nFuck. Dave-\nBROWN\nYeah?\nDAVIS\nI hope you can forgive me, brother.\nAll this anger- all this pent-up rage I've been tackling lately, it's no good. It spews my thoughts... and then, well I'm hawking insults like some asshole at a decent kid like you.\nBROWN\nDecent man. Or guy.\nSMITH\nDave, rewind.\nBROWN\n(Brown nods in agreement)\nBut really, I'm gracious, I mean truly gracious for what you're saying here, man. I'm gonna just let it slide. And for the rest of us, and all of this bullshit we're heading on, we need to be smart. The creep's in here somewhere. Split up, hack it yourselves, and then prosecute.\nSMITH\n(goes up to Brown, shakes his hand)\nYeah in a serious light, we don't have to hate each other, man. And some of us, genuine guys like you and I, got to stick to this thing together. We're stronger than that, and imagine banding together.\nBROWN\nThe base of respect aside, I don't think that's the best idea, at least for now. I mean just what I told these guys, it applies to you as well, Davis.\nSMITH\nLook I know we are all in this as a team, and for the most part that\u2019ll hopefully never change, but Brown\u2019s got a solid point. We\u2019ve gotta squeeze the rat out of our system, that\u2019s firstly. Secondly, we have to afterwards see where we went wrong, and then, make sure this is the last time something like this ever happens.", "http://genius.com/Theking36-hustle-rough-draft-annotated"],

Or buy your coach.\u201d\n\nVaccaro\u2019s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers\u2014among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the \u201csneaker pimp\u201d of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, \u201cshould a university be an advertising medium for your industry?\u201d\n\nVaccaro did not blink. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sold your souls, and you\u2019re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,\u201d Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, \u201cbut there\u2019s not one of you in this room that\u2019s going to turn down any of our money. You\u2019re going to take it. I can only offer it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Friday, a former president of North Carolina\u2019s university system, still winces at the memory. \u201cBoy, the silence that fell in that room,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI never will forget it.\u201d Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro \u201cthe worst of all\u201d the witnesses ever to come before the panel.\n\nBut what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it\u2019s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources\u2014but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.\n\nEducators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university\u2019s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. \u201cWe do every little thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.\u201d Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, \u201cwe shut down the university at 3 o\u2019clock to accommodate the crowds.\u201d He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano\u2014a sound mind in a sound body\u2014and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.\n\nWith so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State\u2014to name just a few big-revenue football schools\u2014each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes\u2014football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win\u2014corruption is likely to follow.\n\nScandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received \u201cimproper benefits\u201d while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team\u2019s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son\u2019s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.\n\nThe list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of \u201camateurism.\u201d Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to \u201cclean up\u201d college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.\n\nFor all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it\u2019s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence\u2014\u201camateurism\u201d and the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d\u2014are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.\n\n\nDon Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: \u201cI think we should pay these guys something.\u201d\n\nFans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.\n\nBut after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what\u2019s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.\n\nSlavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene\u2014corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.\n\nThe NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it\u2014most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years\u2014have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clich\u00e9s, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.\n\nFounding Myths\nFrom the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England\u2019s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6\u20134.\n\nWalter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming \u201cthe father of American football.\u201d He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried \u201cDown!\u201d in submission.\n\nIn an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a \u201cflying wedge,\u201d based on Napoleon\u2019s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as \u201chalf a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,\u201d noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university\u2019s president, brought up other concerns. \u201cDeaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,\u201d declared Eliot. \u201cThat cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.\u201d Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team\u2019s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.\n\nA newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport\u2014and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure\u2019s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp\u2019s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he\u2019d established. At Roosevelt\u2019s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard\u2019s playing style at the expense of Yale\u2019s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, \u201cAmerican College Athletics,\u201d which concluded that the scramble for players had \u201creached the proportions of nationwide commerce.\u201d Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.\n\nEmbarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a \u201cSanity Code,\u201d which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.\n\nThis bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s university were so rigorous.\n\nThe Big Bluff\nIn 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid \u201cperp\u201d photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA\u2019s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.\n\nBut Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean\u2014A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president\u2014not to contest the NCAA\u2019s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952\u201353 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.\n\nThe Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161\u20137 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.\n\nAll but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called \u201cthe Big Bluff.\u201d\n\nByers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year\u2014the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.\n\nOnly one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA\u2019s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers\u2019s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA\u2019s television package up to $3.1 million per football season\u2014which was higher than the NFL\u2019s figure in those early years\u2014had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.\n\n\u201cWe Eat What We Kill\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers\u2019s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures\u2014such as restrictions on team size\u2014designed to help smaller schools. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,\u201d Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and \u201980s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings\u2014and advertising revenue\u2014to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn\u2019t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?\n\nByers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA\u2019s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.\n\nWith a huge chunk of the NCAA\u2019s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment \u2026 of the NCAA,\u201d said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA\u2019s latest football contracts with television\u2014and any future ones\u2014as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA\u2019s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky\u2019s challenge to the NCAA\u2019s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. \u201cWe eat what we kill,\u201d one official at the University of Texas bragged.\n\nA few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA\u2014but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered\u2014and then far exceeded\u2014what the organization had lost from football.\n\nStill, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA\u2019s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like fa\u00e7ade. During Byers\u2019s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA\u2019s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was \u201cgnawing at the innards of college athletics,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA\u2019s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, \u201cdesecrated my sacred vows.\u201d But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football\u2019s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.\n\nMeanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education\u2019s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, \u201cKeeping Faith With the Student Athlete,\u201d was published; the commission\u2019s \u201cbedrock conviction\u201d was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA\u2019s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (\u201cA Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education\u201d) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had \u201cgrown rather than diminished\u201d since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament\u2019s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Myth of the \u201cStudent-Athlete\u201d\nToday, much of the NCAA\u2019s moral authority\u2014indeed much of the justification for its existence\u2014is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the \u201cstudent-athlete.\u201d The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its \u201cfight against workmen\u2019s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe crafted the term student-athlete,\u201d Walter Byers himself wrote, \u201cand soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.\u201d The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen\u2019s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a \u201cwork-related\u201d accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school\u2019s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was \u201cnot in the football business.\u201d\n\nThe term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA\u2019s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.\n\nUsing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a \u201cRed Right 28\u201d sweep toward the Crimson Tide\u2019s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. \u201cIt was like talking to God, if you\u2019re a young football player,\u201d Waldrep recalled.\n\nWaldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.\n\nThrough the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers\u2019 compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. \u201cI can brush my teeth,\u201d he told me last year, \u201cbut I still need help to bathe and dress.\u201d) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would\u2014but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep\u2019s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials \u201csaid they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,\u201d which he says was absurd.)\n\nThe long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term\u2019s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.\n\nLast Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton\u2019s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about the coin toss.\u201d In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama\u2019s 4\u201324 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.\n\nFinally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama\u2019s public-address-system operators played \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28\u201327, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton\u2019s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father\u2019s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.\n\n\u201cOur championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, \u201care one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoremasters\u201d\nNCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men\u2019s basketball tournament alone. That\u2019s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs\u2014on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players\u2019 willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. \u201cThey were going to dress and go out on the floor,\u201d Friday told me, \u201cbut refuse to play,\u201d in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids\u2014unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday\u2019s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.\n\nCognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights\u2014souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals\u2014and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men\u2019s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world\u2019s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were \u201cterrible fights\u201d between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.\n\nAll of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series\u2014but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You \u201csee everybody getting richer and richer,\u201d Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. \u201cAnd you walk around and you can\u2019t put gas in your car? You can\u2019t even fly home to see your parents?\u201d\n\nSome athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system\u2014and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O\u2019Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. \u201cOnce you leave your university,\u201d says O\u2019Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA\u2019s national-championship basketball team, \u201cone would think your likeness belongs to you.\u201d The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O\u2019Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. \u201cThe NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,\u201d NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, \u201cor prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of \u201cyour name or picture \u2026 to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.\u201d Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA\u2019s core mission of amateurism to be its \u201clast defense standing.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the NCAA\u2019s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports\u2014basketball and football\u2014since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches\u2019 growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that\u2019s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon\u2019s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)\n\nThe NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches\u2019 entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.\n\nThe late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published \u201cConfessions of an Agent,\u201d a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama\u2019s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. \u201cI hate to say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. \u201cLook at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,\u201d Brown once reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re the whoremasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPicayune Rules\u201d\nNCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion\u2014and distract attention from the larger issues\u2014by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a \u201cmaze of picayune rules.\u201d The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he\u2019d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green\u2019s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.\n\nA few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from \u201chook-ups on tatts\u201d\u2014that is, that they\u2019d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia\u2014a violation of the NCAA\u2019s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State\u2019s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players\u2019 eyeblack\u2014reportedly aimed at Pryor\u2019s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nThe moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos\u2014but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they\u2019d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos\u2014one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet\u2014as part of Auburn\u2019s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.\n\n\u201cRestitution\u201d\nObscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn\u2019t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.\n\nHad Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice\u2014indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen\u2014NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.\n\nJust hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA\u2019s \u201crestitution rule\u201d (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,\u2019\u201d Oliver recalls.\n\nThe Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to \u201cdictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,\u201d violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA\u2019s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver\u2019s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.\n\nThe NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay \u201can unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.\u201d Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he\u2019d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience \u201cmade me grow up a little quicker.\u201d His lawyer claimed victory. \u201cAndy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,\u201d said Rick Johnson.\n\nYet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver\u2019s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA\u2019s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had\u2014that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver\u2019s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him\u2014indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays\u2019 president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton\u2019s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA\u2019s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.\n\nThough Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.\n\nAs the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America\u2019s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver\u2019s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton\u2019s behalf, arguing that the state constitution\u2014plus the university\u2019s code of student conduct\u2014barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. \u201cDue to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,\u201d the university stated, it \u201ccould not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.\u201d The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. \u201cWhen negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,\u201d Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, \u201cthose negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.\u201d\n\nPaxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.\n\n\u201cYou Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head\u201d\n\u201cWhen you dream about playing in college,\u201d Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, \u201cyou don\u2019t ever think about being in a lawsuit.\u201d Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009\u2014the same fate he had suffered.\n\nIn October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school\u2014which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew\u2019s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.\n\nAgnew\u2019s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal\u2014making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama\u2019s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA\u2014an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships\u2014to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a \u201cmerit award\u201d that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of \u201cmerit\u201d could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d just as pro sports teams cut their players. \u201cPlenty of them don\u2019t stay in school,\u201d said one of Agnew\u2019s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. \u201cThey\u2019re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew\u2019s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA\u2019s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.\n\n\u201cThey Want to Crush These Kids\u201d\nAcademic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d for the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.\n\nWithin big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she\u2019d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24\u201320, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, \u201cWho do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?\u201d (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.\n\nIn trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. \u201cWe have to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia\u2019s defense lawyer, explained the university\u2019s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. \u201cWe may not make a university student out of him,\u201d Almand told the court, \u201cbut if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.\u201d This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA\u2019s reason for being\u2014to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports\u2014but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.\n\nTHE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a \u201cmedia circus.\u201d The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. \u201cThe enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,\u201d Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. \u201cThe committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cannot be conned.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton\u2019s answers onscreen and hit \u201csubmit,\u201d as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student\u2019s completed test.\n\nMonk\u2019s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU\u2019s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.\n\nTwenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden\u2019s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.\n\nWhen reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee\u2019s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually \u201cpossessed\u201d the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant\u2019s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida\u2019s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state\u2019s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.\n\nNews interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe self-reported this case,\u201d he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes\u2014those who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, this happens all the time?\u201d\u2014received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.\n\nIn January of last year, the NCAA\u2019s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden\u2019s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno\u2019s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.\n\nCruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded \u201cshow cause\u201d order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 \u201cshall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.\u201d Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.\n\nTHE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. \u201cAll the NCAA\u2019s enforcements are random and selective,\u201d he told me, calling the organization\u2019s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson\u2019s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. \u201cWhat kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,\u201d Johnson asks. It\u2019s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal\u2014every college gets something\u2014but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.\n\nSearching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization\u2019s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA\u2019s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation \u201cto discourage legal actions against the NCAA,\u201d according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. \u201cThey want to crush these kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is \u201cnot bound by any judicial due process standards,\u201d its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and \u201cvery likely exceed\u201d those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. \u201cIn order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.\u201d\n\nTo translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.\n\nPotuto\u2019s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.\n\nThe debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges\u2014trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the \u201ccontamination\u201d of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism\u2014and the free labor it provides\u2014may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn\u2019t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?\n\n\u201cThe Plantation Mentality\u201d\n\u201cNinety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro says. \u201cGo to the skill positions\u201d\u2014the stars. \u201cNinety percent African Americans.\u201d The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. \u201cTheir organization is a fraud.\u201d\n\nVaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. \u201cThe kids and their parents gave me a good life,\u201d he says in his peppery staccato. \u201cI want to give something back.\u201d Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. \u201cHere\u2019s what I preach,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cThis goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I\u2019m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I\u2019m 71 years old.\u201d\n\nVaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O\u2019Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.\n\nJon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro \u201copened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.\u201d King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro\u2019s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, \u201chad a mountain of documents,\u201d he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O\u2019Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller\u2014a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games\u2014are pursuing a parallel \u201cright of publicity\u201d track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson\u2019s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.\n\nVaccaro had sought a law firm for O\u2019Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. \u201cThe numbers are off the wall,\u201d Vaccaro says. \u201cThe public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.\u201d\n\nVaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA\u2019s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims\u2019 families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.\n\nHausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question,\u201d he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.\n\n\u201cWhat right is it that they\u2019re waiving?,\u201d Hausfeld asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t waive something you don\u2019t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.\u201d (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers by saying: \u201cThere is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.\u201d Jon King says this is \u201clike telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.\u201d The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O\u2019Bannon complaint.)\n\nThe waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O\u2019Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.\u201d He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella\u2014\u201ca most effective cartel.\u201d\n\nThe faux ideal of amateurism is \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d Hausfeld said, sending for a book. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.\u201d An assistant brought in Byers\u2019s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:\n\nThe college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today\u2019s campus executives.\nHe looked up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the NCAA\u2019s architect.\u201d He found a key recommendation on page 388:\n\nProsecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel\u2014not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.\nCould the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy for the O\u2019Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. \u201cAnd we want to know what they\u2019re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a lot of money. We agree. How much?\u201d\n\nThe work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hausfeld asked rhetorically. \u201cWe know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it\u2019s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can\u2019t. End of story.\u201d\n\nIN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission\u2019s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public\u2014television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches\u2019 salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.\n\n\u201cMoney surrounds college sports,\u201d says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. \u201cAnd every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.\u201d Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. \u201cApproximately 1 percent of NCAA men\u2019s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,\u201d stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, \u201cand just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.\u201d Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are \u201castronomically high,\u201d the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a \u201crude surprise\u201d and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it\u2019s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism\u2014because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.\n\nThe most basic reform would treat the students as what they are\u2014adults, with rights and reason of their own\u2014and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player\u2019s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?\n\nUniversity administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. \u201cI would not want to be part of it,\u201d North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. \u201cWe would have to think long and hard,\u201d Baddour added gravely, \u201cabout whether this university would continue those sports at all.\u201d\n\nI, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent\u2014but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. \u201cEven in the increasingly commercial modern world,\u201d said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, \u201cthis Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.\u201d The fact that \u201cthe NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,\u201d said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, \u201cdoes not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBut one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O\u2019Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, \u201cit will turn college sports on its ear,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThough the O\u2019Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier\u2019s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. \u201cThe integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,\u201d Emmert said in July. \u201cWe have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThreats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA\u2019s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate \u201cinformal\u201d football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games\u2014workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.\n\nThe greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA\u2019s assistance, the association would be terrified\u2014and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don\u2019t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don\u2019t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money\u2014an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.\n\nThus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. \u201cThere will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,\u201d says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). \u201cIf I\u2019m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.\u201d\n\nThis danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.\n\nA deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA\u2019s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature\u2014a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.\n\nFOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA\u2019s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936\u2014weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy\u2014because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nUltimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved\u2014and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport\u2019s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.\n\nThis sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing your virginity. You\u2019re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there\u2019s a whole new world out there!\u201d\n\nWithout logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA\u2019s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be \u201can unacceptable surrender to despair.\u201d Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay college players,\u201d said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it. We\u2019d lose something precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cScholarship athletes are already paid,\u201d declared the Knight Commission members, \u201cin the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.\u201d This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.", "http://genius.com/Taylor-branch-the-shame-of-college-sports-annotated"], "1677954": ["Pre-Hibernation by\u00a0Pantera", "Pre-Hibernation Lyrics\n\nJellyfishing!\nJellyfishing!\nJellyfishing!\nJellyfishing!", "http://genius.com/Pantera-pre-hibernation-lyrics"], "1352474": ["Outro by\u00a0Fort\u00a0Minor", "Outro Lyrics\n\nLadies and gentlemen\nYou are tuned into the Fort Minor mixtape\nYo, Green, tell 'em what the name of the mixtape is\n\nFort Minor, of course\nIt's always a pleasure, Mike, where we go?\n\nFort Minor, We Major\n\nGotta say \"What up?\" to my executive producer: Mr. S dot Carter\n\"What up?\" to Ghostface, Fiasco, Sixx John\nBishop Lamont, Trek Life, Celph Titled, Apathy\nScoop De Ville, Styles of Beyond, Machine Shop\n\nThe Rising Tied in stores November 22", "http://genius.com/Fort-minor-outro-lyrics"], "1698977": ["Long Lost John by\u00a0The\u00a0Everly Brothers", "Long Lost John Lyrics\n\nThe funniest sight I ever did see\nWas a-long lost John from Bowlin' Green\nHe had no shoes for to cover his feet\nBeggin\u2019 the women for his bread and meat\n\nOne woman said \"Get away from here John\nFor to take my broom and hurry you on\"\nHe's a long gone\nWhere did he go?\nBoogied his a-way to Mexico\n\nOne woman said, \"John what'd please you?\"\nJohn said, \"Why dear I thought you knew\nIn the morning I want a leg of lamb\nForty-nine kisses and a hock of ham;\nTomorrow evening when the sun goes down\nDon't fix a thing \u2018cause I won\u2019t be 'round\"\nHe long gone\nWhere did he go?\nHe boogied his a-way to Mexico", "http://genius.com/The-everly-brothers-long-lost-john-lyrics"], "499748": ["Group Sex by\u00a0Circle\u00a0Jerks", "Group Sex Lyrics\n\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\n\nPrivate swing party\nFriday & saturday night\nWouldn't it be nice\nTo have a party with couples\nThat are friendly and mellow?\nA ion-key atmosphere\nWhere you can explore\nYour most sensual fantasies\nWith other aware sensitive couples?\n\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\nGroup sex!\n\nWhere you can bring someone\nYou care about without embarrassment?\nPrivacy good food & music\nRefreshments, cleanliness\nAnd a super-jacuzzi too?\nThat's what parties at the\nA-frame are all about\nCall 213-659-3756\nBest time to call is\nFriday and saturday afternoons\nSee you there!\n\nGroup sex!", "http://genius.com/Circle-jerks-group-sex-lyrics"], "1400262": ["The Very First Christmas by\u00a0SpongeBob\u00a0SquarePants", "The Very First Christmas Lyrics\n\n[Spongebob and Patrick:]\nIt's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday\nNot your normal, average, everyday\n\n[Squidward:]\nSounds like someone fell my old coral tree\nSpongebob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me?\n\n[Spongebob and Patrick:]\nThe world feels like it's in loverly\n\nSquidward:\nGo away before I harm you bodily\n\nSpongebob and Patrick:\nThis Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me\n\n[Spongebob and Patrick:]\nThere'll be shopping, decorating, and plenty of snow\n\n[Spongebob:]\nHey Patrick, who's that under the mistletoe?\n\n[Squidward:]\nWhat?

A Mindset. A Movement\nWe believe in the freedom to swing out fist so long as it does not make contact with a fellow human\nWe believe that compromise produces a collective strength, as opposed to the selfish,

stay with us everyday\nBut we only see what moves\nAnd I can't help but notice this new view\n\nMaybe no one will understand me like you could\nBut I need more than to be understood\nThe way to crash is to stay in the same direction for good\n\nThere's a thirst and a rat with a leech on its back\nThat was made to attain what can't be sustained\nAnd the feelings decay, but the hunger remains\nAnd it drives me to my grave\n\nMaybe no one will understand me like you could\nBut I need more than to be understood\nThe way to crash is to stay in the same direction for good",

Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.\n\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\n\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.\n\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?\n\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.\n\nWere their views on some points divergent?\n\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.\n\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\n\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.\n\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?\n\nIn 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.\n\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?\n\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.\n\nAs in what ways?\n\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\n\nWhat action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\n\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\n\nWas it there?\n\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.\n\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\n\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.\n\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\n\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\n\nBloom's decision?\n\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.\n\nDid he fall?\n\nBy his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.\n\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\n\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.\n\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\n\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.\n\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\n\nAlter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.\n\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\n\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.\n\nWhat did Bloom do?\n\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\n\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\n\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.\n\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?\n\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.\n\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\n\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.\n\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\n\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.\n\nDid it flow?\n\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.\n\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?\n\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.\n\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?\n\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\n\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?\n\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.\n\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?\n\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\n\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\n\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\n\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\n\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.\n\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?\n\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\n\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.\n\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\n\nTo shave himself.\n\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\n\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.\n\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises\n\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.\n\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?\n\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.\n\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?\n\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.\n\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\n\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.\n\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\n\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.\n\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?\n\nIn Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\n\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\n\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.\n\nHis mood?\n\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.\n\nWhat satisfied him?\n\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.\n\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\n\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.\n\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?\n\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).\n\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?\n\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.\n\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?\n\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.\n\nWho drank more quickly?\n\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.\n\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\n\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\n\nHad he found their solution?\n\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.\n\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?\n\nAn ambition to squint\nAt my verses in print\nMakes me hope that for these you'll find room.\nIf you so condescend\nThen please place at the end\nThe name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\n\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\n\nName, age, race, creed.\n\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\n\nLeopold Bloom\n\nEllpodbomool\n\nMolldopeloob.\n\nBollo edoom\n\nOld Ollebo, M. P.\n\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\n\nPoets oft have sung in rhyme\nOf music sweet their praise divine.\nLet them hymn it nine times nine.\nBearer far than song or wine,\nYou are mine. The world is mine.\n\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?\n\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.\n\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\n\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.\n\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\n\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\n\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\n\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\n\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?\n\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\n\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?\n\nMrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.\n\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\n\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.\n\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\n\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.\n\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?\n\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\n\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?\n\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\n\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\n\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.\n\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\n\nNeither.\n\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?\n\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.\n\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?\n\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\n\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?\n\nBloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.\n\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\n\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.\n\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?\n\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.\n\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\n\nThe scientific. The artistic.\n\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?\n\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\n\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?\n\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.\n\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\n\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.\n\nSuch as?\n\nK. 11.

Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.\n\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?\n\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.\n\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\n\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary\n\nWhat?\n\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...\n\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\n\nThe Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.\n\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?\n\nCoincidence.\n\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\n\nHe preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.\n\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?\n\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\n\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?\n\nWhat to do with our wives.\n\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\n\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.\n\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\n\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).\n\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\n\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.\n\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\n\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.\n\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\n\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.\n\nWhat system had proved more effective?\n\nIndirect suggestion implicating self-interest.\n\nExample?\n\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\n\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?\n\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\n\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?\n\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.\n\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?\n\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\n\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?\n\nBy Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\n\nBy Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\n\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?\n\nOn the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.\n\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\n\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\n\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?\n\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\n\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?\n\nKolod balejwaw pnimali\nNefesch, jehudi, homijah.\n\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\n\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\n\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.\n\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\n\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\n\nDid the guest comply with his host's request?\n\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\n\nWhat was Stephen's auditive sensation?\n\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.\n\nWhat was Bloom's visual sensation?\n\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.\n\nWhat were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?\n\nVisually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\n\nAuditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.\n\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?\n\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\n\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?\n\nReassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.\n\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?\n\nD Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball\nAnd the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.\nAnd the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe broke the jew's windows all.\n\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\n\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.\n\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\n\nThen out there came the jew's daughter\nAnd she all dressed in green.\n`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,\nAnd play your ball again.'\n\n`I can't come back and I won't come back\nWithout my schoolfellows all,\nFor if my master he did hear\nHe'd make it a sorry ball.'\n\nShe took him by the lilywhite hand\nAnd led him along the hall\nUntil she led him to a room\nWhere none could hear him call.\n\nShe took a penknife out of her pocket\nAnd cut off his little head,\nAnd now he'll play his ball no more\nFor he lies among the dead.\n\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\n\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.\n\nCondense Stephen's commentary.\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.\n\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\n\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.\n\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\n\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\n\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\n\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\n\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?\n\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.\n\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?\n\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\n\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\n\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.\n\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\n\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\n\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\n\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).\n\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\n\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\n\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?\n\nA temporary departure of his cat.\n\nWhy similarly, why differently?\n\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.\n\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\n\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.\n\nAs?\n\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\n\nIn what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\n\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.\n\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\n\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\n\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?\n\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.\n\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?\n\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.\n\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?\n\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.\n\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?\n\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\n\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?\n\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\n\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\n\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\n\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\n\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (\u01531.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.\n\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\n\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).\n\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?\n\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.\n\nWas the clown Bloom's son?\n\nNo.\n\nHad Bloom's coin returned?\n\nNever.\n\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\n\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.\n\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?\n\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.\n\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\n\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.\n\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\n\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.\n\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\n\nNot verbally. Substantially.\n\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\n\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\n\nI n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?\n\nLighted Candle in Stick borne by\nBLOOM.\nDiaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by\nSTEPHEN.\n\nWith what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?\n\nThe 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra\u00ebl de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.\n\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\n\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.\n\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\n\nFor a cat.\n\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\n\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\n\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?\n\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\n\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\n\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.\n\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\n\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\n\nDid he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\n\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.\n\nAnd the problem of possible redemption?\nThe minor was proved by the major.\n\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\n\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.\n\nHis (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?\n\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.\n\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\n\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.\n\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?\n\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\n\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?\n\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.\n\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?\n\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\n\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\n\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.\n\nBoth then were silent?\n\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\n\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\n\nAt Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.\n\nSimilarly?\n\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.\n\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?\n\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.\n\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\n\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\n\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?\n\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\n\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\n\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\n\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\n\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.\n\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\n\nBy Stephen:\n\nLiliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\nIubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\n\nBy Bloom:\n\nHeigho, heigho,\nHeigho, heigho.\n\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?\n\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).\n\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\n\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.\n\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\n\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R\u00e9aumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.\n\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?\n\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).\n\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\n\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.\n\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\n\nOnce, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.\n\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\n\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\n\nDid he remain?\n\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.\n\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\n\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\n\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?\n\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\n\nDescribe them.\n\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.\n\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\n\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.\n\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\n\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.\n\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\n\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.\n\nHis next proceeding?\n\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.\n\nWhat followed this operation?\n\nThat truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\n\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?\n\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.\n\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?\n\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\n\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?\n\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\n\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\n\nBrothers and sisters had he none,\nYet that man's father was his grandfather's son.\n\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\n\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.\n\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\n\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.\n\nCatalogue these books.\n\nThorn's Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886.\n\nDenis Florence M'Carthy's Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark at p. 5).\n\nShakespeare's Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\n\nThe Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth).\n\nThe Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled binding).\n\nThe Child's Guide (blue cloth).\n\nWhen We Were Boys by William O'Brien M.P.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\n\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\n\nHow was the irritation allayed?\n\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.\n\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\n\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\n\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\n\n#. s. d. #. s. d.\n\n1 Pork kidney 0. 0. 3 Cash in hand 0.4.9\n\n2 Copy Freeman's Journal 0.0.2 Commission recd.

continue?\n\nSensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.\n\nWhy with satisfaction?\n\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.\n\nIn what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?\n\nNot to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity

P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).\n\nWhat course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?\n\nA course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.\n\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\n\nTo master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.\n\nHow much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?\n\nAs per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated.\n\nWhat rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase?\n\nA private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time).

As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.\n\nWhat did he fear?\n\nThe committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.\n\nWhat were habitually his final meditations?\n\nOf some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.\n\nWhat did the first drawer unlocked contain?\n\nA Vere Foster's handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent) Bloom, certain pages of which bore diagram drawings marked Papli, which showed a large globular head with 5 hairs erect, 2 eyes in profile, the trunk full front with 3 large buttons, 1 triangular foot: 2 fading photographs of queen Alexandra of England and of Maud Branscombe, actress and professional beauty: a Yuletide card, bearing on it a pictorial representation of a parasitic plant, the legend Mizpah, the date Xmas 1892, the name of the senders, from Mr and Mrs M.

An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed To my Dear Son Leopold.\n\nWhat fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke?\n\nTomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always... of me... das Herr... Gott... dein...\n\nWhat reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?\n\nAn old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.\n\nWhy did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?\n\nBecause in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.\n\nAs?\n\nThe prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.\n\nHow did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?\n\nNot more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.\n\nWhat first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?\n\nRudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.\n\nHad time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?\n\nIn narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.\n\nWhat idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?\n\nOccasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.\n\nWhat two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?\n\nThe myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.\n\nWhat object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?\n\nThe endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.\n\nReduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.\n\nSuccessively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.

Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.\n\nWith which attendant indignities?\n\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.\n\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\n\nBy decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).\n\nWhich preferably?\n\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?\n\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not irrational?\n\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it desirable?\n\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.\n\nIn Ireland?\n\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\n\nAbroad?\n\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E.

Everyman or Noman.\n\nWhat tributes his?\n\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\n\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\n\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.\n\nWhat would render such return irrational?\n\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.\n\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\n\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.\n\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?\n\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).\n\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\n\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).\n\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\n\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\n\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?\n\nWho was M'Intosh?\n\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\n\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\n\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?\n\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street.\n\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\n\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.\n\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?\n\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\n\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?\n\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).\n\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\n\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).\n\nBloom's acts?\n\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.\n\nHow?\n\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.\n\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\n\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\n\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\n\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.\n\nWhat preceding series?\n\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.\n\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?\n\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).\n\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?\n\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.\n\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?\n\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\n\nEnvy?\n\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.\n\nJealousy?\n\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\n\nAbnegation?\n\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.\n\nEquanimity?\n\nAs natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.\n\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\n\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.\n\nWhat retribution, if any?\n\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.\n\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\n\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.\n\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\n\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.\n\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\n\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.\n\nThen?\n\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\n\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\n\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\n\nWhat followed this silent action?\n\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.\n\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\n\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.\n\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\n\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\n\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\n\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.\n\nHow?\n\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.\n\nWhat moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?\n\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\n\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\n\nListener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45\u00f8 to the terrestrial equator.\n\nIn what state of rest or motion?\n\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.\n\nIn what posture?\n\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\n\nWomb?

It was swept and garnished for the reception of a visitor. That visitor was Betsey Prig; Mrs Prig, of Bartlemy's; or as some said Barklemy's, or as some said Bardlemy's; for by all these endearing and familiar appellations, had the hospital of Saint Bartholomew become a household word among the sisterhood which Betsey Prig adorned.\n\nMrs Gamp's apartment was not a spacious one, but, to a contented mind, a closet is a palace; and the first-floor front at Mr Sweedlepipe's may have been, in the imagination of Mrs Gamp, a stately pile. If it were not exactly that, to restless intellects, it at least comprised as much accommodation as any person, not sanguine to insanity, could have looked for in a room of its dimensions. For only keep the bedstead always in your mind; and you were safe. That was the grand secret. Remembering the bedstead, you might even stoop to look under the little round table for anything you had dropped, without hurting yourself much against the chest of drawers, or qualifying as a patient of Saint Bartholomew, by falling into the fire.\n\nVisitors were much assisted in their cautious efforts to preserve an unflagging recollection of this piece of furniture, by its size; which was great. It was not a turn-up bedstead, nor yet a French bedstead, nor yet a four-post bedstead, but what is poetically called a tent; the sacking whereof was low and bulgy, insomuch that Mrs Gamp's box would not go under it, but stopped half-way, in a manner which, while it did violence to the reason, likewise endangered the legs of a stranger. The frame too, which would have supported the canopy and hangings if there had been any, was ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber, which on the slightest provocation, and frequently on none at all, came tumbling down; harassing the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors.\n\nThe bed itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity; and at the upper end, upon the side nearest to the door, hung a scanty curtain of blue check, which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in Kingsgate Street, from visiting Mrs Gamp's head too roughly. Some rusty gowns and other articles of that lady's wardrobe depended from the posts; and these had so adapted themselves by long usage to her figure, that more than one impatient husband coming in precipitately, at about the time of twilight, had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself. One gentleman, coming on the usual hasty errand, had said indeed, that they looked like guardian angels 'watching of her in her sleep.' But that, as Mrs Gamp said, 'was his first;' and he never repeated the sentiment, though he often repeated his visit.\n\nThe chairs in Mrs Gamp's apartment were extremely large and broad-backed, which was more than a sufficient reason for there being but two in number. They were both elbow-chairs, of ancient mahogany; and were chiefly valuable for the slippery nature of their seats, which had been originally horsehair, but were now covered with a shiny substance of a bluish tint, from which the visitor began to slide away with a dismayed countenance, immediately after sitting down. What Mrs Gamp wanted in chairs she made up in bandboxes; of which she had a great collection, devoted to the reception of various miscellaneous valuables, which were not, however, as well protected as the good woman, by a pleasant fiction, seemed to think; for, though every bandbox had a carefully closed lid, not one among them had a bottom; owing to which cause the property within was merely, as it were, extinguished. The chest of drawers having been originally made to stand upon the top of another chest, had a dwarfish, elfin look, alone; but in regard of its security it had a great advantage over the bandboxes, for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off, it was very difficult to get at its contents. This indeed was only to be done by one or two devices; either by tilting the whole structure forward until all the drawers fell out together, or by opening them singly with knives, like oysters.\n\nMrs Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the fire-place; beginning below the surface (as in nature) with the coals, and mounting gradually upwards to the spirits, which, from motives of delicacy, she kept in a teapot. The chimney-piece was ornamented with a small almanack, marked here and there in Mrs Gamp's own hand with a memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected to fall due. It was also embellished with three profiles: one, in colours, of Mrs Gamp herself in early life; one, in bronze, of a lady in feathers, supposed to be Mrs Harris, as she appeared when dressed for a ball; and one, in black, of Mr Gamp, deceased. The last was a full length, in order that the likeness might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the wooden leg.\n\nA pair of bellows, a pair of pattens, a toasting-fork, a kettle, a pap-boat, a spoon for the administration of medicine to the refractory, and lastly, Mrs Gamp's umbrella, which as something of great price and rarity, was displayed with particular ostentation, completed the decorations of the chimney-piece and adjacent wall. Towards these objects Mrs Gamp raised her eyes in satisfaction when she had arranged the tea-board, and had concluded her arrangements for the reception of Betsey Prig, even unto the setting forth of two pounds of Newcastle salmon, intensely pickled.\n\n'There! Now drat you, Betsey, don't be long!' said Mrs Gamp, apostrophizing her absent friend. 'For I can't abear to wait, I do assure you. To wotever place I goes, I sticks to this one mortar, \"I'm easy pleased; it is but little as I wants; but I must have that little of the best, and to the minute when the clock strikes, else we do not part as I could wish, but bearin' malice in our arts.\"'\n\nHer own preparations were of the best, for they comprehended a delicate new loaf, a plate of fresh butter, a basin of fine white sugar, and other arrangements on the same scale. Even the snuff with which she now refreshed herself, was so choice in quality that she took a second pinch.\n\n'There's the little bell a-ringing now,' said Mrs Gamp, hurrying to the stair-head and looking over. 'Betsey Prig, my\u2014why it's that there disapintin' Sweedlepipes, I do believe.'\n\n'Yes, it's me,' said the barber in a faint voice; 'I've just come in.'\n\n'You're always a-comin' in, I think,' muttered Mrs Gamp to herself, 'except wen you're a-goin' out. I ha'n't no patience with that man!'\n'Mrs Gamp,' said the barber. 'I say! Mrs Gamp!'\n\n'Well,' cried Mrs Gamp, impatiently, as she descended the stairs. 'What is it? Is the Thames a-fire, and cooking its own fish, Mr Sweedlepipes? Why wot's the man gone and been a-doin' of to himself? He's as white as chalk!'\n\nShe added the latter clause of inquiry, when she got downstairs, and found him seated in the shaving-chair, pale and disconsolate.\n\n'You recollect,' said Poll. 'You recollect young\u2014'\n\n'Not young Wilkins!' cried Mrs Gamp. 'Don't say young Wilkins, wotever you do. If young Wilkins's wife is took\u2014'\n\n'It isn't anybody's wife,' exclaimed the little barber. 'Bailey, young Bailey!'\n\n'Why, wot do you mean to say that chit's been a-doin' of?' retorted Mrs Gamp, sharply. 'Stuff and nonsense, Mrs Sweedlepipes!'\n\n'He hasn't been a-doing anything!' exclaimed poor Poll, quite desperate. 'What do you catch me up so short for, when you see me put out to that extent that I can hardly speak? He'll never do anything again. He's done for. He's killed. The first time I ever see that boy,' said Poll, 'I charged him too much for a red-poll. I asked him three-halfpence for a penny one, because I was afraid he'd beat me down. But he didn't. And now he's dead; and if you was to crowd all the steam-engines and electric fluids that ever was, into this shop, and set 'em every one to work their hardest, they couldn't square the account, though it's only a ha'penny!'\n\nMr Sweedlepipe turned aside to the towel, and wiped his eyes with it.\n\n'And what a clever boy he was!' he said. 'What a surprising young chap he was! How he talked! and what a deal he know'd! Shaved in this very chair he was; only for fun; it was all his fun; he was full of it. Ah! to think that he'll never be shaved in earnest! The birds might every one have died, and welcome,' cried the little barber, looking round him at the cages, and again applying to the towel, 'sooner than I'd have heard this news!'\n\n'How did you ever come to hear it?' said Mrs Gamp, 'who told you?'\n\n'I went out,' returned the little barber, 'into the City, to meet a sporting gent upon the Stock Exchange, that wanted a few slow pigeons to practice at; and when I'd done with him, I went to get a little drop of beer, and there I heard everybody a-talking about it. It's in the papers.'\n\n'You are in a nice state of confugion, Mr Sweedlepipes, you are!' said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head; 'and my opinion is, as half-a-dudgeon fresh young lively leeches on your temples, wouldn't be too much to clear your mind, which so I tell you. Wot were they a-talkin' on, and wot was in the papers?'\n\n'All about it!' cried the barber. 'What else do you suppose? Him and his master were upset on a journey, and he was carried to Salisbury, and was breathing his last when the account came away. He never spoke afterwards. Not a single word. That's the worst of it to me; but that ain't all. His master can't be found. The other manager of their office in the city, Crimple, David Crimple, has gone off with the money, and is advertised for, with a reward, upon the walls. Mr Montague, poor young Bailey's master (what a boy he was!) is advertised for, too. Some say he's slipped off, to join his friend abroad; some say he mayn't have got away yet; and they're looking for him high and low. Their office is a smash; a swindle altogether. But what's a Life Assurance office to a Life! And what a Life Young Bailey's was!'\n\n'He was born into a wale,' said Mrs Gamp, with philosophical coolness. 'and he lived in a wale; and he must take the consequences of sech a sitiwation. But don't you hear nothink of Mr Chuzzlewit in all this?'\n\n'No,' said Poll, 'nothing to speak of. His name wasn't printed as one of the board, though some people say it was just going to be. Some believe he was took in, and some believe he was one of the takers-in; but however that may be, they can't prove nothing against him. This morning he went up of his own accord afore the Lord Mayor or some of them City big-wigs, and complained that he'd been swindled, and that these two persons had gone off and cheated him, and that he had just found out that Montague's name wasn't even Montague, but something else.\nAnd they do say that he looked like Death, owing to his losses. But, Lord forgive me,' cried the barber, coming back again to the subject of his individual grief, 'what's his looks to me! He might have died and welcome, fifty times, and not been such a loss as Bailey!'\n\nAt this juncture the little bell rang, and the deep voice of Mrs Prig struck into the conversation.\n\n'Oh! You're a-talkin' about it, are you!' observed that lady. 'Well, I hope you've got it over, for I ain't interested in it myself.'\n\n'My precious Betsey,' said Mrs Gamp, 'how late you are!'\n\nThe worthy Mrs Prig replied, with some asperity, 'that if perwerse people went off dead, when they was least expected, it warn't no fault of her'n.' And further, 'that it was quite aggrawation enough to be made late when one was dropping for one's tea, without hearing on it again.'\nMrs Gamp, deriving from this exhibition of repartee some clue to the state of Mrs Prig's feelings, instantly conducted her upstairs; deeming that the sight of pickled salmon might work a softening change.\n\nBut Betsey Prig expected pickled salmon. It was obvious that she did; for her first words, after glancing at the table, were:\n\n'I know'd she wouldn't have a cowcumber!'\n\nMrs Gamp changed colour, and sat down upon the bedstead.\n\n'Lord bless you, Betsey Prig, your words is true. I quite forgot it!'\n\nMrs Prig, looking steadfastly at her friend, put her hand in her pocket, and with an air of surly triumph drew forth either the oldest of lettuces or youngest of cabbages, but at any rate, a green vegetable of an expansive nature, and of such magnificent proportions that she was obliged to shut it up like an umbrella before she could pull it out. She also produced a handful of mustard and cress, a trifle of the herb called dandelion, three bunches of radishes, an onion rather larger than an average turnip, three substantial slices of beetroot, and a short prong or antler of celery; the whole of this garden-stuff having been publicly exhibited, but a short time before, as a twopenny salad, and purchased by Mrs Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into her pocket. Which had been happily accomplished, in High Holborn, to the breathless interest of a hackney-coach stand. And she laid so little stress on this surprising forethought, that she did not even smile, but returning her pocket into its accustomed sphere, merely recommended that these productions of nature should be sliced up, for immediate consumption, in plenty of vinegar.\n\n'And don't go a-droppin' none of your snuff in it,' said Mrs Prig. 'In gruel, barley-water, apple-tea, mutton-broth, and that, it don't signify. It stimulates a patient. But I don't relish it myself.'\n\n'Why, Betsey Prig!' cried Mrs Gamp, 'how CAN you talk so!'\n\n'Why, ain't your patients, wotever their diseases is, always asneezin' their wery heads off, along of your snuff?' said Mrs Prig.\n\n'And wot if they are!' said Mrs Gamp\n\n'Nothing if they are,' said Mrs Prig. 'But don't deny it, Sairah.'\n\n'Who deniges of it?' Mrs Gamp inquired.\n\nMrs Prig returned no answer.\n\n'WHO deniges of it, Betsey?' Mrs Gamp inquired again. Then Mrs Gamp, by reversing the question, imparted a deeper and more awful character of solemnity to the same. 'Betsey, who deniges of it?'\n\nIt was the nearest possible approach to a very decided difference of opinion between these ladies; but Mrs Prig's impatience for the meal being greater at the moment than her impatience of contradiction, she replied, for the present, 'Nobody, if you don't, Sairah,' and prepared herself for tea. For a quarrel can be taken up at any time, but a limited quantity of salmon cannot.\n\nHer toilet was simple. She had merely to 'chuck' her bonnet and shawl upon the bed; give her hair two pulls, one upon the right side and one upon the left, as if she were ringing a couple of bells; and all was done. The tea was already made, Mrs Gamp was not long over the salad, and they were soon at the height of their repast.\n\nThe temper of both parties was improved, for the time being, by the enjoyments of the table. When the meal came to a termination (which it was pretty long in doing), and Mrs Gamp having cleared away, produced the teapot from the top shelf, simultaneously with a couple of wine-glasses, they were quite amiable.\n\n'Betsey,' said Mrs Gamp, filling her own glass and passing the teapot, 'I will now propoge a toast. My frequent pardner, Betsey Prig!'\n'Which, altering the name to Sairah Gamp; I drink,' said Mrs Prig, 'with love and tenderness.'\n\nFrom this moment symptoms of inflammation began to lurk in the nose of each lady; and perhaps, notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary, in the temper also.\n\n'Now, Sairah,' said Mrs Prig, 'joining business with pleasure, wot is this case in which you wants me?'\n\nMrs Gamp betraying in her face some intention of returning an evasive answer, Betsey added:\n\n'IS it Mrs Harris?'\n\n'No, Betsey Prig, it ain't,' was Mrs Gamp's reply.\n\n'Well!' said Mrs Prig, with a short laugh. 'I'm glad of that, at any rate.'\n\n'Why should you be glad of that, Betsey?' Mrs Gamp retorted, warmly. 'She is unbeknown to you except by hearsay, why should you be glad? If you have anythink to say contrairy to the character of Mrs Harris, which well I knows behind her back, afore her face, or anywheres, is not to be impeaged, out with it, Betsey. I have know'd that sweetest and best of women,' said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head, and shedding tears, 'ever since afore her First, which Mr Harris who was dreadful timid went and stopped his ears in a empty dog-kennel, and never took his hands away or come out once till he was showed the baby, wen bein' took with fits, the doctor collared him and laid him on his back upon the airy stones, and she was told to ease her mind, his owls was organs. And I have know'd her, Betsey Prig, when he has hurt her feelin' art by sayin' of his Ninth that it was one too many, if not two, while that dear innocent was cooin' in his face, which thrive it did though bandy, but I have never know'd as you had occagion to be glad, Betsey, on accounts of Mrs Harris not requiring you. Require she never will, depend upon it, for her constant words in sickness is, and will be, \"Send for Sairey?\"'\n\nDuring this touching address, Mrs Prig adroitly feigning to be the victim of that absence of mind which has its origin in excessive attention to one topic, helped herself from the teapot without appearing to observe it. Mrs Gamp observed it, however, and came to a premature close in consequence.\n\n'Well, it ain't her, it seems,' said Mrs Prig, coldly; 'who is it then?'\n\n'You have heerd me mention, Betsey,' Mrs Gamp replied, after glancing in an expressive and marked manner at the tea-pot, 'a person as I took care on at the time as you and me was pardners off and on, in that there fever at the Bull?'\n\n'Old Snuffey,' Mrs Prig observed.\n\nSarah Gamp looked at her with an eye of fire, for she saw in this mistake of Mrs Prig, another willful and malignant stab at that same weakness or custom of hers, an ungenerous allusion to which, on the part of Betsey, had first disturbed their harmony that evening. And she saw it still more clearly, when, politely but firmly correcting that lady by the distinct enunciation of the word 'Chuffey,' Mrs Prig received the correction with a diabolical laugh.\n\nThe best among us have their failings, and it must be conceded of Mrs Prig, that if there were a blemish in the goodness of her disposition, it was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and acid properties upon her patients (as a thoroughly amiable woman would have done), but of keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her friends. Highly pickled salmon, and lettuces chopped up in vinegar, may, as viands possessing some acidity of their own, have encouraged and increased this failing in Mrs Prig; and every application to the teapot certainly did; for it was often remarked of her by her friends, that she was most contradictory when most elevated. It is certain that her countenance became about this time derisive and defiant, and that she sat with her arms folded, and one eye shut up, in a somewhat offensive, because obstrusively intelligent, manner.\n\nMrs Gamp observing this, felt it the more necessary that Mrs Prig should know her place, and be made sensible of her exact station in society, as well as of her obligations to herself. She therefore assumed an air of greater patronage and importance, as she went on to answer Mrs Prig a little more in detail.\n\n'Mr Chuffey, Betsey,' said Mrs Gamp, 'is weak in his mind. Excuge me if I makes remark, that he may neither be so weak as people thinks, nor people may not think he is so weak as they pretends, and what I knows, I knows; and what you don't, you don't; so do not ask me, Betsey. But Mr Chuffey's friends has made propojals for his bein' took care on, and has said to me, \"Mrs Gamp, WILL you undertake it? We couldn't think,\" they says, \"of trusting him to nobody but you, for, Sairey, you are gold as has passed the furnage. Will you undertake it, at your own price, day and night, and by your own self?\" \"No,\" I says, \"I will not. Do not reckon on it. There is,\" I says, \"but one creetur in the world as I would undertake on sech terms, and her name is Harris. But,\" I says, \"I am acquainted with a friend, whose name is Betsey Prig, that I can recommend, and will assist me. Betsey,\" I says, \"is always to be trusted under me, and will be guided as I could desire.\"'\nHere Mrs Prig, without any abatement of her offensive manner again counterfeited abstraction of mind, and stretched out her hand to the teapot. It was more than Mrs Gamp could bear. She stopped the hand of Mrs Prig with her own, and said, with great feeling:\n\n'No, Betsey! Drink fair, wotever you do!'\n\nMrs Prig, thus baffled, threw herself back in her chair, and closing the same eye more emphatically, and folding her arms tighter, suffered her head to roll slowly from side to side, while she surveyed her friend with a contemptuous smile.\n\nMrs Gamp resumed:\n\n'Mrs Harris, Betsey\u2014'\n\n'Bother Mrs Harris!' said Betsey Prig.\n\nMrs Gamp looked at her with amazement, incredulity, and indignation; when Mrs Prig, shutting her eye still closer, and folding her arms still tighter, uttered these memorable and tremendous words:\n\n'I don't believe there's no sich a person!'\n\nAfter the utterance of which expressions, she leaned forward, and snapped her fingers once, twice, thrice; each time nearer to the face of Mrs Gamp, and then rose to put on her bonnet, as one who felt that there was now a gulf between them, which nothing could ever bridge across.\nThe shock of this blow was so violent and sudden, that Mrs Gamp sat staring at nothing with uplifted eyes, and her mouth open as if she were gasping for breath, until Betsey Prig had put on her bonnet and her shawl, and was gathering the latter about her throat. Then Mrs Gamp rose\u2014morally and physically rose\u2014and denounced her.\n\n'What!' said Mrs Gamp, 'you bage creetur, have I know'd Mrs Harris five and thirty year, to be told at last that there ain't no sech a person livin'! Have I stood her friend in all her troubles, great and small, for it to come at last to sech a end as this, which her own sweet picter hanging up afore you all the time, to shame your Bragian words! But well you mayn't believe there's no sech a creetur, for she wouldn't demean herself to look at you, and often has she said, when I have made mention of your name, which, to my sinful sorrow, I have done, \"What, Sairey Gamp! debage yourself to HER!\" Go along with you!'\n\n'I'm a-goin', ma'am, ain't I?' said Mrs Prig, stopping as she said it.\n\n'You had better, ma'am,' said Mrs Gamp.\n\n'Do you know who you're talking to, ma'am?' inquired her visitor.\n\n'Aperiently,' said Mrs Gamp, surveying her with scorn from head to foot, 'to Betsey Prig. Aperiently so. I know her. No one better. Go along with you!'\n\n'And YOU was a-goin' to take me under you!' cried Mrs Prig, surveying Mrs Gamp from head to foot in her turn. 'YOU was, was you? Oh, how kind! Why, deuce take your imperence,' said Mrs Prig, with a rapid change from banter to ferocity, 'what do you mean?'\n\n'Go along with you!' said Mrs Gamp. 'I blush for you.'\n\n'You had better blush a little for yourself, while you ARE about it!' said Mrs Prig. 'You and your Chuffeys! What, the poor old creetur isn't mad enough, isn't he? Aha!'\n\n'He'd very soon be mad enough, if you had anything to do with him,' said Mrs Gamp.\n\n'And that's what I was wanted for, is it?' cried Mrs Prig, triumphantly. 'Yes. But you'll find yourself deceived. I won't go near him. We shall see how you get on without me. I won't have nothink to do with him.'\n\n'You never spoke a truer word than that!' said Mrs Gamp. 'Go along with you!'\n\nShe was prevented from witnessing the actual retirement of Mrs Prig from the room, notwithstanding the great desire she had expressed to behold it, by that lady, in her angry withdrawal, coming into contact with the bedstead, and bringing down the previously mentioned pippins; three or four of which came rattling on the head of Mrs Gamp so smartly, that when she recovered from this wooden shower-bath, Mrs Prig was gone.\n\nShe had the satisfaction, however, of hearing the deep voice of Betsey, proclaiming her injuries and her determination to have nothing to do with Mr Chuffey, down the stairs, and along the passage, and even out in Kingsgate Street. Likewise of seeing in her own apartment, in the place of Mrs Prig, Mr Sweedlepipe and two gentlemen.\n\n'Why, bless my life!' exclaimed the little barber, 'what's amiss? The noise you ladies have been making, Mrs Gamp! Why, these two gentlemen have been standing on the stairs, outside the door, nearly all the time, trying to make you hear, while you were pelting away, hammer and tongs! It'll be the death of the little bullfinch in the shop, that draws his own water. In his fright, he's been a-straining himself all to bits, drawing more water than he could drink in a twelvemonth. He must have thought it was Fire!'\n\nMrs Gamp had in the meanwhile sunk into her chair, from whence, turning up her overflowing eyes, and clasping her hands, she delivered the following lamentation:\n\n'Oh, Mr Sweedlepipes, which Mr Westlock also, if my eyes do not deceive, and a friend not havin' the pleasure of bein' beknown, wot I have took from Betsey Prig this blessed night, no mortial creetur knows! If she had abuged me, bein' in liquor, which I thought I smelt her wen she come, but could not so believe, not bein' used myself'\u2014Mrs Gamp, by the way, was pretty far gone, and the fragrance of the teapot was strong in the room\u2014'I could have bore it with a thankful art. But the words she spoke of Mrs Harris, lambs could not forgive. No, Betsey!' said Mrs Gamp, in a violent burst of feeling, 'nor worms forget!'\n\nThe little barber scratched his head, and shook it, and looked at the teapot, and gradually got out of the room. John Westlock, taking a chair, sat down on one side of Mrs Gamp. Martin, taking the foot of the bed, supported her on the other.\n\n'You wonder what we want, I daresay,' observed John. 'I'll tell you presently, when you have recovered. It's not pressing, for a few minutes or so. How do you find yourself? Better?'\n\nMrs Gamp shed more tears, shook her head and feebly pronounced Mrs Harris's name.\n\n'Have a little\u2014' John was at a loss what to call it.\n\n'Tea,' suggested Martin.\n\n'It ain't tea,' said Mrs Gamp.\n\n'Physic of some sort, I suppose,' cried John. 'Have a little.'\n\nMrs Gamp was prevailed upon to take a glassful. 'On condition,' she passionately observed, 'as Betsey never has another stroke of work from me.'\n\n'Certainly not,' said John. 'She shall never help to nurse ME.'\n\n'To think,' said Mrs Gamp, 'as she should ever have helped to nuss that friend of yourn, and been so near of hearing things that\u2014Ah!'\nJohn looked at Martin.\n\n'Yes,' he said. 'That was a narrow escape, Mrs Gamp.'\n\n'Narrer, in-deed!' she returned. 'It was only my having the night, and hearin' of him in his wanderins; and her the day, that saved it. Wot would she have said and done, if she had know'd what I know; that perfeejus wretch! Yet, oh good gracious me!' cried Mrs Gamp, trampling on the floor, in the absence of Mrs Prig, 'that I should hear from that same woman's lips what I have heerd her speak of Mrs Harris!'\n'Never mind,' said John. 'You know it is not true.'\n\n'Isn't true!' cried Mrs Gamp. 'True! Don't I know as that dear woman is expecting of me at this minnit, Mr Westlock, and is a-lookin' out of window down the street, with little Tommy Harris in her arms, as calls me his own Gammy, and truly calls, for bless the mottled little legs of that there precious child (like Canterbury Brawn his own dear father says, which so they are) his own I have been, ever since I found him, Mr Westlock, with his small red worsted shoe a-gurglin' in his throat, where he had put it in his play, a chick, wile they was leavin' of him on the floor a-lookin' for it through the ouse and him a-choakin' sweetly in the parlour! Oh, Betsey Prig, what wickedness you've showed this night, but never shall you darken Sairey's doors agen, you twining serpiant!'\n\n'You were always so kind to her, too!' said John, consolingly.\n\n'That's the cutting part. That's where it hurts me, Mr Westlock,' Mrs Gamp replied; holding out her glass unconsciously, while Martin filled it.\n\n'Chosen to help you with Mr Lewsome!' said John. 'Chosen to help you with Mr Chuffey!'\n\n'Chose once, but chose no more,' cried Mrs Gamp. 'No pardnership with Betsey Prig agen, sir!'\n\n'No, no,' said John. 'That would never do.'\n\n'I don't know as it ever would have done, sir,' Mrs Gamp replied, with a solemnity peculiar to a certain stage of intoxication. 'Now that the marks,' by which Mrs Gamp is supposed to have meant mask, 'is off that creetur's face, I do not think it ever would have done. There are reagions in families for keeping things a secret, Mr Westlock, and havin' only them about you as you knows you can repoge in. Who could repoge in Betsey Prig, arter her words of Mrs Harris, setting in that chair afore my eyes!'\n\n'Quite true,' said John; 'quite. I hope you have time to find another assistant, Mrs Gamp?'\n\nBetween her indignation and the teapot, her powers of comprehending what was said to her began to fail. She looked at John with tearful eyes, and murmuring the well-remembered name which Mrs Prig had challenged\u2014as if it were a talisman against all earthly sorrows\u2014seemed to wander in her mind.\n\n'I hope,' repeated John, 'that you have time to find another assistant?'\n\n'Which short it is, indeed,' cried Mrs Gamp, turning up her languid eyes, and clasping Mr Westlock's wrist with matronly affection. 'To-morrow evenin', sir, I waits upon his friends. Mr Chuzzlewit apinted it from nine to ten.'\n\n'From nine to ten,' said John, with a significant glance at Martin. 'and then Mr Chuffey retires into safe keeping, does he?'\n\n'He needs to be kep safe, I do assure you,' Mrs Gamp replied with a mysterious air. 'Other people besides me has had a happy deliverance from Betsey Prig. I little know'd that woman. She'd have let it out!'\n\n'Let HIM out, you mean,' said John.\n\n'Do I!' retorted Mrs Gamp. 'Oh!'\n\nThe severely ironical character of this reply was strengthened by a very slow nod, and a still slower drawing down of the corners of Mrs Gamp's mouth. She added with extreme stateliness of manner after indulging in a short doze:\n\n'But I am a-keepin' of you gentlemen, and time is precious.'\n\nMingling with that delusion of the teapot which inspired her with the belief that they wanted her to go somewhere immediately, a shrewd avoidance of any further reference to the topics into which she had lately strayed, Mrs Gamp rose; and putting away the teapot in its accustomed place, and locking the cupboard with much gravity proceeded to attire herself for a professional visit.\n\nThis preparation was easily made, as it required nothing more than the snuffy black bonnet, the snuffy black shawl, the pattens and the indispensable umbrella, without which neither a lying-in nor a laying-out could by any possibility be attempted. When Mrs Gamp had invested herself with these appendages she returned to her chair, and sitting down again, declared herself quite ready.\n\n'It's a 'appiness to know as one can benefit the poor sweet creetur,' she observed, 'I'm sure. It isn't all as can. The torters Betsey Prig inflicts is frightful!'\n\nClosing her eyes as she made this remark, in the acuteness of her commiseration for Betsey's patients, she forgot to open them again until she dropped a patten. Her nap was also broken at intervals like the fabled slumbers of Friar Bacon, by the dropping of the other patten, and of the umbrella. But when she had got rid of those incumbrances, her sleep was peaceful.\n\nThe two young men looked at each other, ludicrously enough; and Martin, stifling his disposition to laugh, whispered in John Westlock's ear,\n'What shall we do now?'\n\n'Stay here,' he replied.\n\nMrs Gamp was heard to murmur 'Mrs Harris' in her sleep.\n\n'Rely upon it,' whispered John, looking cautiously towards her, 'that you shall question this old clerk, though you go as Mrs Harris herself. We know quite enough to carry her our own way now, at all events; thanks to this quarrel, which confirms the old saying that when rogues fall out, honest people get what they want. Let Jonas Chuzzlewit look to himself; and let her sleep as long as she likes. We shall gain our end in good time.'", "http://genius.com/Charles-dickens-life-and-adventures-of-martin-chuzzlewit-chap-49-annotated"], "1361108": ["Green Isaac by\u00a0Prefab\u00a0Sprout", "Green Isaac Lyrics\n\nStella Mater, light is failing\nMaking such a fool of thee\nWhen you'd love to be someone...\n\nThis is the time, I've set aside\nFrom selling old rope\nAnd telling bad jokes\nAnd cul de sac pride\n\nI've learnt today, while falling apart\nThe most eloquent way\nTo speak or to pray\nIs straight from the heart\n\nOh but to shine like Joan of Arc\nYou must be prepared to burn\n\nForget the style and choose from twelve notes\nIn itself it's a joy\nWhether it soothes or annoys\nA song starts in the throat\n\nTake two kinds of look, and one wedding day\nNow isn't it clear\nThere's nothing they'll hear\nThat you'd want to say\n\nAnd if you've no new clothes to wear\nThen simply wash and comb you hair\n\nAnd little green Isaac, you're gonna walk backwards through the room\nDoes that mean I won't see you?\nIt means you're gonna walk backwards through the room\nAnd little green Isaac, I hear you're still wet behind the ears\nIsaac's a soft name, it sounds like a pocketful of rain\nWell up that stairway he rose, and down that stairway he goes\nGGGGreen Isaac GGGGreen Isaac GGGGreen Isaac", "http://genius.com/Prefab-sprout-green-isaac-lyrics"], "1749590": ["Life (Support) by\u00a0QueenAdreena", "Life (Support) Lyrics\n\nYour dog has lost his tag and now he has no name\nYour mobile phone drink deep of vodka and shame\nWatching you as you move\nI see you panicking in your locked room\nIt took me a lifetime to realise you were just an actor\nA curtain twitcher's feast\nI lie down in incoming traffic and I make my peace\nIt took me a lifetime to realise I was just an anchor\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please\nA gap to fill in your gill\nWrap it up as a pill\nI got down on your lap steel\nJust me and the crows and the garden fence\nSearching for hard-earned recompense\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please\nA broken racket machination\nLike a madman masturbating in the train station\nCircuitous defeat\nDeafening sideways rush\nStill standing grimace\nAs I collapse to the floor\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please\nSomebody turn off the life support machine\nSomebody turn off the life support please", "http://genius.com/Queenadreena-life-support-lyrics"], "1105785": ["As De Fisken by\u00a0Nynke\u00a0Laverman", "As De Fisken Lyrics\n\nKom as de fisken\nKalm mei iepen eagen\nS\u00fbnder seare wurden\nInkeld belleblaas\n\nWit fan myn gefaren\nSobje se net stikken\nEn lit in \u00e2ld ferhaal\nMar stil foarby gean\nOan \u00fas doar\n\nSjoch nei wat der is\nSjoch nei wat it seit\nSjoch mei bleate eagen\nWat it seit\n\nKom as de fisken\nKoel en ademleas\nS\u00fbnder seare wurden\nInkeld belleblaas", "http://genius.com/Nynke-laverman-as-de-fisken-lyrics"], "1119323": ["Magpie by\u00a0Patrick\u00a0Wolf", "Magpie Lyrics\n\nPATRICK: magpie, was it you who stole the wedding ring?

Now, this attitude on my father\u2019s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original \u2018young Swann\u2019 and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette\u2019s husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann\u2019s call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents\u2019 old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason \u2014 and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole \u2014 was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists \u2014 modest or generous by nature \u2014 who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the \u2018Mistress,\u2019 Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspeli\u00e8re. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte\u2019s father in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one\u2019s eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace \u2014 such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert \u2014 for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also \u2014 that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard\u2019s, on the evenings when she entertained \u2014 in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty \u2014 the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard\u2019s hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins\u2019, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions \u2014 even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services \u2014 by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des D\u00e9bats itself, the title of \u2018Statesmen,\u2019 and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves \u2014 to profess only the \u2018right\u2019 opinions, to frequent only the \u2018sound\u2019 people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free-masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or \u2018back\u2019 him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to \u2018arrive\u2019 in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to \u2018bring off\u2019 a rich marriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called \u2018governmental,\u2019 which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates \u2014 high or low, it makes no matter \u2014 by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouv\u00e9, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Maxime Ducamp\u2019s or Mezi\u00e8re\u2019s eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barr\u00e9s to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or L\u00e9on Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated \u2014 in a speech or in a protocol \u2014 into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat next to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man\u2019s intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. \u201cDe Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it\u2019s quite extraordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he\u2019s going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the \u2018Seventy war.\u201d My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. \u201cI must ask him whether the King\u2019s visit had any real significance,\u201d my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. \u201cI know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he\u2019s with me he opens out quite charmingly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period \u2014 a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away \u2014 that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, \u201cI do not find my hats. I keep them.\u201d In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle \u2018out-of-date,\u2019 which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region \u2014 not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were extremely modern \u2014 but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father\u2019s mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy (so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted); his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that \u2018although,\u2019 with such people, is invariably an unrecognised \u2018because,\u2019 and that (just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings extraordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed) it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people\u2019s duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father\u2019s friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she excepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matin\u00e9e, in Ph\u00e8dre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, \u201cIf you are still so anxious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling \u2018futilities,\u2019 was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, \u201cHow easily led you are!\u201d to my father, who replied angrily \u201cWhat! So it\u2019s you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father\u2019s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to exercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn\u2019t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,\u201d my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be \u2018arranged,\u2019 no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who \u2018counted.\u2019 \u201cI shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux-Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not \u2018gifted,\u2019 that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois\u2019s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Ph\u00e8dre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn dit qu\u2019un prompt d\u00e9part vous \u00e9loigne de\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0nous, Seigneur \u2014 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought \u2014 as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage \u2014 that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Ph\u00e8dre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, expecting to derive from Berma\u2019s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the \u2018star,\u2019 she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time \u2014 at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant \u2014 two acts ofPh\u00e8dre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Ph\u00e8dre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Ph\u00e8dre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess, introducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:\u2014\u201cM. Anatole France.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The doctor who was attending me \u2014 the same who had forbidden me to travel \u2014 advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance \u2014 just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed \u2014 was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents \u2014 even though it were the cause of bodily suffering \u2014 of my otiose existence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor\u2019s visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Ph\u00e8dre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn dit qu\u2019un prompt d\u00e9part vous \u00e9loigne de nous \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte \u2014 in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me \u2014 was passing through my mind; \u201cplastic nobility,\u201d \u201cChristian austerity\u201d or \u201cJansenist pallor,\u201d \u201cPrincess of Troezen and of Cleves\u201d or \u201cMycenean drama,\u201d \u201cDelphic symbol,\u201d \u201cSolar myth\u201d; that divine Beauty, whom Berma\u2019s acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way. But when those had at last fallen, when my mother \u2014 albeit this matin\u00e9e was actually to coincide with the meeting of the Commission from which my father had promised to bring M. de Norpois home to dinner \u2014 had said to me, \u201cVery well, we don\u2019t wish you to be unhappy; \u2014 if you think that you will enjoy it so very much, you must go; that\u2019s all;\u201d when this day of theatre-going, hitherto forbidden and unattainable, depended now only upon myself, then for the first time, being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible, I asked myself if it were desirable, if there were not other reasons than my parents\u2019 prohibition which should make me abandon my design. In the first place, whereas I had been detesting them for their cruelty, their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving-kindness, and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad. \u201cI would rather not go, if it hurts you,\u201d I told my mother, who, on the contrary, strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going, since that, she said, would spoil the pleasure that I should otherwise derive fromPh\u00e8dre, and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision. But then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome. Besides, if I returned home ill, should I be well again in time to be able to go to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es as soon as the holidays were over and Gilberte returned? Against all these arguments I set, so as to decide which course I should take, the idea, invisible there behind its veil, of the perfections of Berma. I cast into one pan of the scales \u201cMaking Mamma unhappy,\u201d \u201crisking not being able to go on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es,\u201d and the other, \u201cJansenist pallor,\u201d \u201cSolar myth,\u201d until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind\u2019s vision, ceased to say anything to me, lost all their force; and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if I had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that I might bring them to an end, and be delivered from them once and for all. It would have been to fix a term to my sufferings, and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction, yielding to the attractions of perfection, that I would let myself be taken, not now to the Wise Goddess, but to the stern, implacable Divinity, featureless and unnamed, who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil. But suddenly everything was altered. My desire to go and hear Berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matin\u00e9e with impatience and with joy; having gone to take up, in front of the column on which the playbills were, my daily station, as excruciating, of late, as that of a stylite saint, I had seen there, still moist and wrinkled, the complete bill of Ph\u00e8dre, which had just been pasted up for the first time (and on which, I must confess, the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide). But it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and \u2014 inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which I read it but from that on which the performance would take place, and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise \u2014 almost imminent, well on the way, already, to its realisation, so that I jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day, and at that hour precisely, I should be sitting there in my place, ready to hear the voice of Berma; and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself, I raced back to the house, whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place, in my mind, of \u201cJansenist pallor\u201d and \u201cSolar myth\u201d; \u2014\u201cLadies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats. The doors will be closed at two o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alas! that first matin\u00e9e was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: \u201cSee that you have a good dinner for us to-night; you remember, I\u2019m bringing de Norpois back with me.\u201d My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Fran\u00e7oise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen \u2014 of which she was indeed a past-master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly \u2014 had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump-steak, shin of beef, calves\u2019-feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II\u2014 Fran\u00e7oise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Fran\u00e7oise had sent to be cooked in the baker\u2019s oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a \u201cNev\u2019-York ham.\u201d Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt \u2014 feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a \u2018York\u2019 and a \u2018New York\u2019\u2014 that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affix \u2018New\u2019 which she pronounced \u2018Nev\u2019.\u2019 And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen-maid: \u201cGo and fetch me a ham from Olida\u2019s. Madame told me especially to get a Nev\u2019-York.\u201d On that particular day, if Fran\u00e7oise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours\u2019 time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas-lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the box-office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist \u2014 for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession \u2014 who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of Mme. Berma\u2019s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone\u2019s salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was \u2018in front,\u2019 who were in the other boxes, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less \u2018good\u2019 conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that \u2014 in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination \u2014 there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which explained to me why, when Fran\u00e7oise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer-blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And \u2014 once this curtain had risen \u2014 when on the stage a writing-table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me \u2014 my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small caf\u00e9 one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble-minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue, I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill-bred an audience \u2014 in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance \u2014 should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Ph\u00e8dre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle (a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the \u2018star\u2019 appeared), an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures \u2014 which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the text, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics \u2014 and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more vexing than Berma\u2019s fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough; \u2014 in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma\u2019s, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice \u2014 I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma\u2019s eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were readingPh\u00e8dre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma\u2019s talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to explore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist\u2019s voice, every expression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back-cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study existed no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which \u0152none or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then, at last, a sense of admiration did possess me, provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience. I mingled my own with theirs, endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that Berma, in her gratitude, should surpass herself, and I be certain of having heard her on one of her great days. A curious thing, by the way, was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was, as I afterwards learned, that in which Berma reveals one of her richest treasures. It would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive. So it is that when any great event occurs, when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy, or defeated, or victorious, the vague and conflicting reports which we receive, from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment, stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised, and in which, once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation, he recognises the popular perception of that \u2018aura\u2019 which surrounds momentous happenings, and which may be visible hundreds of miles away. One learns of a victory either after the war is over, or at once, from the hilarious joy of one\u2019s hall porter. One discovers the touch of genius in Berma\u2019s acting a week after one has heard her, in the criticism of some review, or else on the spot, from the thundering acclamation of the stalls. But this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others, all quite erroneous; the applause came, most often, at wrong moments, apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before, just as in a storm, once the sea is sufficiently disturbed, it will continue to swell, even after the wind has begun to subside. No matter; the more I applauded, the better, it seemed to me, did Berma act. \u201cI say,\u201d came from a woman sitting near me, of no great social pretensions, \u201cshe fairly gives it you, she does; you\u2019d think she\u2019d do herself an injury, the way she runs about. I call that acting, don\u2019t you?\u201d And happy to find these reasons for Berma\u2019s superiority, though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the Gioconda or of Benvenuto\u2019s Perseus a peasant\u2019s gaping \u201cThat\u2019s a good bit of work. It\u2019s all gold, look! Fine, ain\u2019t it?\u201d, I greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm. I felt, all the same, when the curtain had fallen fer the last time, disappointed that the pleasure for which I had so longed had been no greater, but at the same time I felt the need to prolong it, not to depart for ever, when I left the theatre, from this strange life of the stage which had, for a few hours, been my own, from which I should be tearing myself away, as though I were going into exile, when I returned to my; own home, had I not hoped there to learn a great deal more about Berma from her admirer, to whom I was indebted already for the permission to go to Ph\u00e8dre, M. de Norpois. I was introduced to him before dinner by my father, who summoned me into his study for the purpose. As I entered, the Ambassador rose, held out his hand, bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face. As the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him, in the days when he still represented France abroad, were all more or less (even the famous singers) persons of note, with regard to whom he could tell, when he met them, that he would be able to say, later on, when he heard then \u2014 names mentioned in Paris or in Petersburg, that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at Munich or Sofia, he had formed the habit of impressing upon them, by his affability, the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance; but in addition to this, being convinced that in the life of European capitals, in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations, one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout Europe, he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation, so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal. The Government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad, but still, as soon as anyone was introduced to him, his eyes, as though they had not yet been informed of their master\u2019s retirement, began their fruitful observation, while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger\u2019s name was not unknown to him. And so, all the time, while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience, he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity, and to his own profit, as though I had been some exotic custom, some historic and instruct tive building or some \u2018star\u2019 upon his course. And in this way he gave proof at once, in his attitude towards me, of the majestic benevolence of the sage Mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young Anacharsis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deux-Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one\u2019s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the \u2018gift\u2019 for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head (Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers), M. de Norpois, while anything was being explained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer\u2019s hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador\u2019s voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to express\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPrecisely;\u201d he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. \u201cThere is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours.\u201d He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. \u201cHe too has chosen to leave the Quai d\u2019Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he\u2019s had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago \u2014 of course, he\u2019s much older than you, you understand \u2014 a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He\u2019s gone pretty far already, and he\u2019s not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that (without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election) his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can\u2019t say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success \u2014 which doesn\u2019t always come only to agitators and mischief-makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take \u2014 success has crowned his efforts.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My father, seeing me already, in a few years\u2019 time, an Academician, was tasting a contentment which M. de Norpois raised to the supreme pitch when, after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act, he handed me his card and said: \u201cWhy not go and see him yourself? Tell him I sent you. He may be able to give you some good advice,\u201d plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that, next morning, I was to embark as cabin-boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My Aunt L\u00e9onie had bequeathed to me, together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture, with which it was difficult to know what to do, almost all her unsettled estate \u2014 revealing thus after her death an affection for me which I had hardly suspected in her lifetime. My father, who was trustee of this estate until I came of age, now consulted M. de Norpois with regard to several of the investments. He recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest, which he considered particularly sound, notably English consols and Russian four per cents. \u201cWith absolutely first class securities such as those,\u201d said M. de Norpois, \u201ceven if your income from them is nothing very great, you may be certain of never losing any of your capital.\u201d My father then told him, roughly, what else he had bought. M. de Norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation; like all capitalists, he regarded wealth as an enviable thing, but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand, as he was himself immensely rich, he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends, with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own. He made amends for this by congratulating my father, without hesitation, on the \u201ccomposition\u201d of his list of investments, selected \u201cwith so sure, so delicate, so fine a taste.\u201d You would have supposed, to hear him, that he attributed to the relative values of investments, and even to investments themselves, something akin to aesthetic merit. Of one, comparatively recent and still little known, which my father mentioned, M. de Norpois, like the people who have always read the books of which, you imagine, you yourself alone have ever heard, said at once, \u201cAh, yes, I used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers; it was quite interesting,\u201d with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already, in monthly instalments, in his magazine. \u201cIt would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue. It is distinctly attractive; they are offering it at a most tempting discount.\u201d But when he came to some of the older investments, my father, who could not remember their exact names, which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind, opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the Ambassador. The sight of them enchanted me. They were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures, like the old, romantic editions that I had pored over as a child. All the products of one period have something in common; the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses. And nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of Notre-Dame de Paris, and of various books by G\u00e9rard de Nerval, that used to hang outside the grocer\u2019s door at Combray, than does, in its rectangular and flowery border, supported by recumbent river-gods, a \u2018personal share\u2019 in the Water Company\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little \u2018prose poem\u2019 which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of exaltation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father\u2019s occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues \u2014 as exclusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college \u2014 whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. \u201cI had thought,\u201d he ventured, after an endless preamble, \u201cof asking the advice of the Commission . . . \u201d Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion (but scored for a different voice) of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: \u201cof which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day.\u201d This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then,\u2018takes up at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, did you enjoy your matin\u00e9e?\u201d asked my father, as we moved to the dining-room; meaning me to \u2018shew off,\u2019 and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give M. de Norpois a good opinion of me. \u201cHe has just been to hear Berma. You remember, we were talking about it the other day,\u201d he went on, turning towards the diplomat, in the same tone of retrospective, technical, mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the Commission\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to-day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Ph\u00e8dre, but I have always heard that she is excellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to extract from Berma\u2019s playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross-examination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready-made phrases for the words that failed me \u2014 I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, \u201cWhat on earth do you mean; you didn\u2019t enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, I was listening as hard as I could, trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her. Of course, she\u2019s frightfully good, and all that . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf she is \u2018frightfully good,\u2019 what more do you want?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of Mme. Berma,\u201d resumed M. de Norpois, turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother, so as not to let her be left out of the conversation, and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house, \u201cis the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts; thus she can always be assured of success, and success of the right sort. She hardly ever appears in anything trivial. Look how she has thrown herself into the part of Ph\u00e8dre. And then, she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes, and to her acting. In spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in England and America, the vulgarity \u2014 I will not say of John Bull; that would be unjust, at any rate to the England of the Victorian era \u2014 but of Uncle Sam has not infected her. No loud colours, no rant. And then that admirable voice, which has been of such service to her, with which she plays so delightfully \u2014 I should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My interest in Berma\u2019s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain, because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality; but I felt the need to find explanations for it; moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity, while Berma was on the stage, upon everything that she offered, in the indivisibility of a living whole, to my eyes and ears; there was nothing separate or distinct; it welcomed, accordingly, the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity, to the good taste of the actress, it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption, seized hold of them, as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour, in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion. \u201cHe is right!\u201d I told myself. \u201cWhat a charming voice, what an absence of shrillness, what simple costumes, what intelligence to have chosen Ph\u00e8dre. No; I have not been disappointed!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cold beef, spiced with carrots, made its appearance, couched by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly, like transparent blocks of quartz\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have a chef of the first order, Madame,\u201d said M. de Norpois, \u201cand that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master-cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And indeed Fran\u00e7oise, in the excitement of her ambition to make a success, for so distinguished a guest, of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers, had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone, and had recaptured her incomparable Combray manner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is a thing you can\u2019t get in a chophouse \u2014 in the best of them, I mean; a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots; it is admirable! Allow me to come again,\u201d he went on, making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly. \u201cI should be interested to see how your Vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind; I should like, for instance, to see him tackle a boeuf Stroganoff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in \u201cthe career,\u201d quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature.. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: \u201cSo you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;\u201d but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one\u2019s being badly and the other\u2019s well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain expressions which were \u2018common form\u2019 in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad. But the Ambassador, after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat, and without disclosing to us what he thought of it. My mother insisted upon his taking some more, which he did, but saying only, in place of the compliment for which she was hoping: \u201cI obey, Madame, for I can see that it is, on your part, a positive ukase!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe saw in the \u2018papers that you had a long talk with King Theodosius,\u201d my father ventured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne \u2014 to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide-de-camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd I trust, you are satisfied with the results of his visit?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEnchanted! One was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a Sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact, particularly at this highly delicate juncture. For my own part, I reposed entire confidence in the King\u2019s political sense. But I must confess that he far surpassed my expectations. The speech that he made at the Elys\u00e9e, which, according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source, was composed, from beginning to end, by himself, was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters. It was simply masterly; a trifle daring, I quite admit, but with an audacity which, after all, has been fully justified by the event. Traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way, but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe. Very well! There is one method of letting in fresh air, obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend, but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt \u2014 and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did, with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody, and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother. There can be no question that when he spoke of the \u2018affinities\u2019 that bound his country to France, the expression, rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the Chancellories, was a singularly happy one. You see that literary ability is no drawback, even in diplomacy, even upon a throne,\u201d he went on, turning for a moment to myself. \u201cThe community of interests had long been apparent, I quite admit, and the relations of the two Powers were excellent. Still, it needed putting into words. The word was what we were all waiting for, it was chosen with marvellous aptitude; you have seen the effect it had. For my part, I must confess I applauded openly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour friend M. de Vaugoubert will be pleased, after preparing for the agreement all these years.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who \u2014 I have heard \u2014 did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: \u2018I have been neither consulted nor informed!\u2019 indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,\u201d he went on with a malicious smile, \u201cthat certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an exquisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert\u2019s enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,\u201d M. de Norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis. \u201cBut forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!\u201d he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. \u201cIn the words of a fine Arab proverb, \u2018The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!\u2019\u201d After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and examined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who \u2018really counted,\u2019 of \u201cHe who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,\u201d which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of \u201cWorking for the King of Prussia.\u201d For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well-informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point (as he never failed to write): \u201cThe Court of St. James\u2019s was not the last to be sensible of the peril,\u201d or \u201cFeeling ran high on the Singers\u2019 Bridge, which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,\u201d or \u201cA cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,\u201d or yet again, \u201cThat everlasting double-dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz.\u201d By these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carri\u00e8re. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect example of which, at that date, was still: \u201cGive me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis\u201c: for we had not yet imported from the Far East: \u201cVictory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other,as the Japanese say.\u201d This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: \u201cBe it clearly understood in the Quai d\u2019Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, \u2018If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburg.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn short,\u201d M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, \u201cVaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He expected, you understand, a correctly worded speech (which, after the storm-clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good) but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered \u2014 when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this connexion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word \u2018affinities,\u2019 which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal\u2019s baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word \u2018affinities,\u2019 a positive treasure-trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain extent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, \u2018Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne thing, however,\u201d M. de Norpois concluded, \u201cis certain; and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together, uniting their \u2018affinities,\u2019 to borrow the picturesque expression of Theodosius II. It is no more than a word, if you like, but look what success it has had, how the whole of the European press is repeating it, what interest it has aroused, what a new note it has struck. Besides it is distinctly in the young Sovereign\u2019s manner. I will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day. But it is very seldom that, in his prepared speeches, or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation, he does not reveal his character \u2014 I was on the point of saying \u2018does not affix his signature\u2019\u2014 by the use of some incisive word. I myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect, for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, I was thinking, only the other day, that the German Emperor\u2019s telegram could not be much to your liking,\u201d said my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, \u201cOh, that fellow!\u201d before he replied: \u201cIn the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; it is an idea that greatly attracts me; I amuse myself, planning a tour. I should like to go there with you, my dear fellow. But what about you, Madame; have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall perhaps go with my son to Balbec, but I am not certain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Balbec is quite charming, I was down that way a few years ago. They are beginning to build some very pretty little-villas there; I think you\u2019ll like the place. But may I ask what has made you choose Balbec?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood, and Balbec church in particular. I was a little afraid that the tiring journey there, and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him. But I hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel, in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe church at Balbec is very beautiful, sir, is it not?\u201d I inquired, repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of Balbec consisted in its pretty little villas\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, it is not bad; but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the Cathedrals of Rheims and Chartres, or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all, the Sainte-Chapelle here in Paris.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, were you at the Foreign Ministry dinner last night?\u201d asked my father. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d M. de Norpois smiled, \u201cI must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.\u201d My mother checked an impulsive movement, for, being more rapid in perception than my father, she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later. Anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her, just as bad news from France is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves. But she was curious to know what sort of people the Swanns managed to entertain, and so inquired of M. de Norpois as to whom he had met there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, my dear lady, it is a house which (or so it struck me) is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,\u201d replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good-humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn all fairness,\u201d he went on, \u201cI must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 to the Republican world than to Swann\u2019s\u201d (he pronounced it \u201cSvann\u2019s\u201d) \u201ccircle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, \u2018We haven\u2019t a free evening!\u2019 as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over-bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann\u2019s part of any movement in that direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus-feast as this\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPossibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage \u2014 so much is certain \u2014 was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife\u2019s having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann. . . . No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband\u2019s being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such exclusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well-bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an exile, don\u2019t you know; evidently, it\u2019s quite a different world. I don\u2019t think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child\u2019s disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it\u2019s become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly expect that, conscious, more or less of being a \u2014(you remember Moli\u00e8re\u2019s line) he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way \u2014 which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to expect \u2014 there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: \u201cDon\u2019t you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?\u201d had heard him answer dryly: \u201cBut I don\u2019t say that there\u2019s anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right.\u201d She came very near, indeed, to believing that (as he used to threaten in moments of anger) he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that \u201cYou cannot be surprised at anything men do, they\u2019re such brutes,\u201d and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.\u201d Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: \u201cYou can do anything with men when they\u2019re in love with you, they\u2019re such idiots!\u201d a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened; he won\u2019t break anything.\u201d While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elys\u00e9e and so forth, must think of Swann\u2019s behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann\u2019s mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter, Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins\u2019 she had been taught to value above everything else in the world \u2014 a salon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous, people who in their own case would ask themselves, \u201cWhat will M. de Guermantes think, what will Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 say when I marry Mlle, de Montmorency?\u201d, among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured, twenty years earlier, Swann himself, the Swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the Jockey Club, and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which, by consolidating his position, would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in Paris. Only, the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need, like all visions, if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost, to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again, having removed to some other place, your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you. If one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the Jockey Club or the Institute, the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one. Now fully as much as retirement, ill-health or religious conversion, protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old. There was not on Swann\u2019s part, when he married Odette, any renunciation of his social ambitions, for from these ambitions Odette had long ago, in the spiritual sense of the word, detached him. Besides, had he not been so detached, his marriage would have been all the more creditable. It is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that, as a general rule, \u2018impossible\u2019 marriages are the happiest of all. (One cannot very well include among the \u2018impossible\u2019 marriages those that are made for money, there being no instance on record of a couple, of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself, who have not sooner or later been admitted into society, if only by tradition, and on the strength of so many precedents, and so as not to have two conflicting standards.) Perhaps, on the other hand, the artistic, if not the perverse side of Swann\u2019s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself, in one of those crossings of species such as Mendelians practise and mythology records, a creature of a different race, archduchess or prostitute, from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him. There had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with Odette; that was, and from no snobbish motive, the Duchesse de Guermantes. With whom Odette, on the contrary, was but little concerned, thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own, rather than in so vague an empyrean. But when Swann in his daydreams saw Odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her \u2014 her, and above all her daughter \u2014 to call upon the Princesse des Laumes (who was shortly, on the death of her father-in-law, to become Duchesse de Guermantes). He had no desire to introduce them anywhere else, but his heart would soften as he invented \u2014 uttering their actual words to himself \u2014 all the things that the Duchess would say of him to Odette, and Odette to the Duchess, the affection that she would shew for Gilberte, spoiling her, making him proud of his child. He enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend, supposing they were to win it, a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined. In so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive, so it might be said that if Swann married Odette it was in order to present her and Gilberte, without anyone\u2019s else being present, without, if need be, anyone\u2019s else ever coming to know of it, to the Duchesse de Guermantes. We shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that Swann died in the belief that the Duchess would never possibly come to know them. We shall see also that, on the contrary, the Duchesse de Guermantes did associate with Odette and Gilberte after the death of Swann. And doubtless he would have been wiser \u2014 seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter \u2014 not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future, in this connexion, but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it. The laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect, including (consequently) those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible, naturally slow at times, is rendered slower still by our impatience (which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it) and by our very existence, and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it \u2014 have ceased, possibly, to live. Was not Swann conscious of this from his own experience, had there not been already, in his life, as it were a pr\u00e9figuration of what was to happen after his death, a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this Odette whom he had passionately loved \u2014 even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight \u2014 whom he had married when he no longer loved her, when the creature that, in Swann, had so longed to live, had so despaired of living all its life in company with Odette, when that creature was extinct?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I began next to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann\u2019s friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. \u201cWhy, yes!\u201d replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And \u201cUpon my word,\u201d he added, once more addressing my father, \u201cI do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince (although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be), if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs \u2014 imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable \u2014 the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?\u201d inquired my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know; with Princes one never does know,\u201d replied M. de Norpois. \u201cThe most exalted, those who know best how to secure what is due to them, are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion, even by those for which there is most justification, especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves. Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what was your own impression, your Excellency? Do tell us!\u201d my mother asked, from politeness as well as from curiosity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: \u201cQuite excellent!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place, provided that one makes it in a playful tone, in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated, he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds, moistening the old diplomat\u2019s blue eyes and making his nostrils, with their network of tiny scarlet veins, quiver. \u201cShe is altogether charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWas there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?\u201d I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Bergotte was there,\u201d replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy son does not know him, but he admires his work immensely,\u201d my mother explained\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens!\u201d exclaimed M. de Norpois, inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me, when I saw that what I valued a thousand thousand times more than myself, what I regarded as the most exalted thing in the world, was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration. \u201cI do not share your son\u2019s point of view. Bergotte is what I call a flute-player: one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably, although with a great deal of mannerism, of affectation. But when all is said, it is no more than that, and that is nothing very great. Nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction. No action \u2014 or very little \u2014 but above all no range. His books fail at the foundation, or rather they have no foundation at all. At a time like the present, when the ever-increasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading, when the map of Europe has undergone radical alterations, and is on the eve, very probably, of undergoing others more drastic still, when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side, you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget, amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders. I am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term \u2018Art for Art\u2019s sake,\u2019 but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner. Not that Bergotte\u2019s manner is not now and then quite attractive. I have no fault to find with that, but taken as a whole, it is all very precious, very thin, and has very little virility. I can now understand more easily, when I bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for Bergotte, the few lines that you shewed me just now, which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook, since you yourself told me, in all simplicity, that they were merely a childish scribbling.\u201d (I had, indeed, said so, but I did not think anything of the sort.) \u201cFor every sin there is forgiveness, and especially for the sins of youth. After all, others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience, and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day. But one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of Bergotte. You will not, of course, be surprised when I say that there was in it none of his good qualities, since he is a past-master in the art \u2014 incidentally quite superficial \u2014 of handling a certain style of which, at your age, you cannot have acquired even the rudiments. But already there is the same fault, that paradox of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean. That is putting the cart before the horse, even in Bergotte\u2019s books. All those Chinese puzzles of form, all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile. Given a few fireworks, let off prettily enough by an author, and up goes the shout of genius. Works of genius are not so common as all that! Bergotte cannot place to his credit \u2014 does not carry in his baggage, if I may use the expression \u2014 a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception, any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one\u2019s library. I do not discover one such in the whole of his work. But that does not exclude the fact that, with him, the work is infinitely superior to the author. Ah! there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books. It would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his \u2014 more pretentious, more pompous, less fitted for human society. Vulgar at some moments, at others talking like a book, and not even like one of his own, but like a boring book, which his, to do them justice, are not \u2014 such is your Bergotte. He has the most confused mind, alembicated, what our ancestors called a diseur de ph\u00e9bus, and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them. I forget for the moment whether it is Lom\u00e9nie or Sainte-Beuve who tells us that Vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity. But Bergotte has never given us a Cinq-Mars, or a Cachet Rouge, certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paralysed by what M. de Norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which I had submitted to him, and remembering at the same time the difficulties that I experienced when I attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought, I felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that I was not born for a literary life. Doubtless in the old days at Combray certain impressions of a very humble order, or a few pages of Bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value. But this state was what my poem in prose reflected; there could be no doubt that M. de Norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what I had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the Ambassador had not been taken in by it. He had shewn me, on the other hand, what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when I was judged from outside, objectively, by the best-disposed and most intelligent of experts. I felt myself to be struck speechless, overwhelmed; and my mind, like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it, just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius, contracted now, was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which M. de Norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur first introduction \u2014 I speak of Bergotte and myself \u2014\u2014\u201d he resumed, turning to my father, \u201cwas somewhat beset with thorns (which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points). Bergotte \u2014 some years ago, now \u2014 paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and expected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain extent (let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight extent), I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely \u2014 let us be quite frank and say moralising \u2014 that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses (as one knows from one\u2019s own experience), while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann\u2019s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole excuse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd was Mme. Swann\u2019s daughter at the dinner?\u201d I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing-room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M. de Norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember; then: \u201cYes, you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen? Yes, of course, I remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our Amphitryon. I may tell you that I saw but little of her; she retired to bed early. Or else she went out to see a friend \u2014 I forget. But I can see that you are very intimate with the Swann household.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI play with Mlle. Swann in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and she is delightful.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! so that is it, is it? But I assure you, I thought her charming. I must confess to you, however, that I do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother, if I may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI prefer Mlle. Swann\u2019s face, but I admire her mother, too, enormously; I go for walks in the Bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! But I must tell them that; they will be highly flattered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family), this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they \u2018touch up\u2019 the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the \u2018Paris column\u2019 says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her \u2018crowded hour\u2019: \u201cWho will remember this in ten years\u2019 time?\u201d overleaf does not the report of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle-tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero\u2019s books, that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, sir,\u201d I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, \u201cif you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been introduced to her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look (like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces), that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one\u2019s other audience, the person whom one has been addressing \u2014 myself, in this instance \u2014 is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps (out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons anxious to do me harm) the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging \u2014 quite pleasantly \u2014 our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers-by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: \u201cWhat a pity, I haven\u2019t got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!\u201d M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had expressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre-existent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann\u2019s windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure \u2014 however fatal its consequences might prove \u2014 of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte\u2019s presence, in her unknown life and home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for uir stance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:\u2014-\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The performance of Ph\u00e8dre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Ph\u00e8dre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine\u2019s creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of \u201cthe purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art,\u201d it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so exalting that I cried out within myself: \u201cWhat a great artist!\u201d It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: \u201cAfter all!\u201d without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of \u2018the career\u2019 for myself. I fancy that, anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system, what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature. But \u201cLet him alone!\u201d my father protested; \u201cthe main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work. He is no longer a child. He knows pretty well now what he likes, it is not at all probable that he will change, and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life.\u201d That evening, as I waited for the time to arrive when, thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me, I should or should not begin to be happy in life, my father\u2019s words caused me great uneasiness. At all times his unexpected kindnesses had, when they were manifested, prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss, above where his beard began, his glowing cheeks, that if I did not yield to that desire, it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day, as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation, which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself, oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper, to employ a fount of type finer, perhaps, than they deserve, I asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity. But apart from that, when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change, he awakened in me two terrible suspicions. The first was that (at a time when, every day, I regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning) my existence was already begun, and that, furthermore, what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed. The second suspicion, which was nothing more, really, than a variant of the first, was that I was not situated somewhere outside the realm of Time, but was subject to its laws, just like the people in novels who, for that reason, used to plunge me in such depression when I read of their lives, down at Combray, in the fastness of my wicker sentry-box. In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one\u2019s life. And to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged, by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum, to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten, or twenty, or even thirty years. At the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope; at the foot of the next we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty, painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse, scarcely replying to what is said to him, oblivious of the past. In saying of me, \u201cHe is no longer a child,\u201d \u201cHis tastes will not change now,\u201d and so forth, my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in Time, and caused me the same kind of depression as if I had baen, not yet the enfeebled old pensioner, but one of those heroes of whom the author, in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling, says to us at the end of a book: \u201cHe very seldom comes up now from the country. He has finally decided to end his days there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: \u201cUpon my word, old Norpois was rather \u2018typical,\u2019 as you call it, this evening, wasn\u2019t he? When he said that it would not have been \u2018seemly\u2019 to ask the Comte de Paris a question, I was quite afraid you would burst out laughing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all!\u201d answered my mother. \u201cI was delighted to see a man of his standing, and age too, keep that sort of simplicity, which is really a sign of straightforwardness and good-breeding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think so, indeed! That does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind; I know him well, I see him at the Commission, remember, where he is very different from what he was here,\u201d exclaimed my father, who was glad to see that Mamma appreciated M. de Norpois, and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed, because a cordial nature exaggerates a friend\u2019s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them. \u201cWhat was it that he said, again \u2014\u2018With Princes one never does know.\u2019 . . .?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast experience of life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you notice the malicious way he said: \u2018It is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen!\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which M. de Norpois had uttered these words, as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of Bressant\u2019s voice or of Thiron\u2019s in L\u2019Aventuri\u00e8re or in theGendre de M. Poirier. But of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by Fran\u00e7oise, who, years afterwards, even, could not \u2018keep a straight face\u2019 if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the Ambassador as \u2018a chef of the first order,\u2019 a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her, as a War Minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting Sovereign after the grand review. I, as it happened, had preceded my mother to the kitchen. For I had extorted from Fran\u00e7oise, who though opposed to war was cruel, that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill, and I had had no report yet of its death. Fran\u00e7oise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired, and very swiftly. \u201cI have never seen a beast like it; it died without uttering a word; you would have thought it was dumb.\u201d Being but little versed in the language of beasts I suggested that the rabbit had not, perhaps, a cry like the chicken\u2019s. \u201cJust wait till you see,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, filled with contempt for my ignorance, \u201cif rabbits don\u2019t cry every bit as much as chickens. Why, they are far noisier.\u201d She received the compliments of M. de Norpois with the proud simplicity, the joyful and (if but for the moment) intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art. My mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done. I had the same pleasure, that evening, in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that I had had long ago, when I learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations. \u201cThe Ambassador,\u201d my mother told her, \u201cassured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and souffl\u00e9s as good as yours.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth, agreed, but seemed not at all impressed by the title \u2018Ambassador\u2019; she said of M. de Norpois, with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef: \u201cHe\u2019s a good old soul, like me.\u201d She had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived, but knowing that Mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows, and thinking that Mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch (for Fran\u00e7oise saw everywhere nothing but \u2018jealousies\u2019 and \u2018tale-bearings,\u2019 which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the Jesuits or the Jews), she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window, \u2018so as not to have words with Madame,\u2019 and beneath the momentary aspect of M. de Norpois had \u2018thought it was Monsieur Legrand,\u2019 because of what she called his \u2018agelity\u2019 and in spite of their having not a single point in common. \u201cWell,\u201d inquired my mother, \u201cand how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you \u2014 when you choose?\u201d \u201cI really couldn\u2019t say how that becomes about,\u201d replied Fran\u00e7oise, who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb \u2018to come,\u2019 in certain of its meanings at least, and the verb \u2018to become.\u2019 She was speaking the truth, if not the whole truth, being scarcely more capable \u2014 or desirous \u2014 of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song. Their explanations tell us little; it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook. \u201cThey do it in too much of a hurry,\u201d she went on, alluding to the great restaurants, \u201cand then it\u2019s not all done together. You want the beef to become like a sponge, then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop. Still, there was one of those Caf\u00e9s where I thought they did know a little bit about cooking. I don\u2019t say it was altogether my jelly, but it was very nicely done, and the souffl\u00e9s had plenty of cream.\u201d \u201cDo you mean Henry\u2019s?\u201d asked my father (who had now joined us), for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the Place Gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners. \u201cOh, dear no!\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt. \u201cI meant a little restaurant. At that Henry\u2019s it\u2019s all very good, sure enough, but it\u2019s not a restaurant, it\u2019s more like a \u2014 soup-kitchen.\u201d \u201cWeber\u2019s, then?\u201d \u201cOh, no, sir, I meant a good restaurant. Weber\u2019s, that\u2019s in the Rue Royale; that\u2019s not a restaurant, it\u2019s a drinking-shop. I don\u2019t know that the food they give you there is even served. I think they don\u2019t have any tablecloths; they just shove it down in front of you like that, with a take it or leave it.\u201d \u201cGiro\u2019s?\u201d \u201cOh! there I should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world.\u201d (\u2018World\u2019 meant for Fran\u00e7oise the under-world.) \u201cLord! They need that to fetch the boys in.\u201d We could see that, with all her air of simplicity, Fran\u00e7oise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous \u2018comrade\u2019 than the most jealous, the most infatuated of actresses. We felt, all the same, that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition; for she went on: \u201cNo, I mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table. It\u2019s a place of some consequence, too. Plenty of custom there. Oh, they raked in the coppers there, all right.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, being an economist, reckoned in coppers, where your plunger would reckon in gold. \u201cMadame knows the place well enough, down there to the right along the main boulevards, a little way back.\u201d The restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and good-humoured tolerance was, it turned out, the Caf\u00e9 Anglais\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When New Year\u2019s Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand (with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father) according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing-room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glac\u00e9s or d\u00e9guis\u00e9s in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint-Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l\u2019Ecole de M\u00e9decine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our visits ended (my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her, since we were to dine there that evening), I ran all the way to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to give to our own special stall-keeper, with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the Swanns to buy gingerbread, the letter which, on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety, I had decided to send her at the New Year, and in which I told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year, that I would forget, now, my old sorrows and disappointments, and that, from this first day of January, it was a new friendship that we were going to cement, one so solid that nothing could destroy it, so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty, and to warn me in time, as I promised to warn her, should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it. On our way home Fran\u00e7oise made me stop at the corner of the Rue Royale, before an open-air stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of Pius IX and Raspail, while for myself I purchased one of Berma. The innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with, unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a \u2018change,\u2019 this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip, the arch of her eyebrows, a few other physical peculiarities always the same, which, when it came to that, were at the mercy of a burn or a blow. This face, moreover, could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful, but it gave me the idea, and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received, for which, from its page in the album, it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze, that artificially ingenuous smile. For our Berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of Phaedra, longings of which everything, even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth, must render the gratification so easy to her. Night was falling; I stopped before a column of playbills, on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on January 1. A moist and gentle breeze was blowing. It was a time of day and year that I knew; I suddenly felt a presentiment that New Year\u2019s Day was not a day different from, the rest, that it was not the first day of a new world, in which, I might, by a chance that had never yet occurred, that was still intact, make Gilberte\u2019s acquaintance afresh, as at the Creation of the World, as though the past had no longer any existence, as though there had been obliterated, with the indications which I might have preserved for my future guidance, the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me; a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old \u2014 save one thing, my desire that Gilberte should love me. I realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction, round about it, of a universe that had not satisfied it before, it was because my heart had not altered, and I told myself that there was no reason why Gilberte\u2019s should have altered either; I felt that this new friendship was the same, just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them, without being able to reach and so to modify them, invests, unknown to themselves, with distinctive names. I might dedicate this new year, if I chose, to Gilberte, and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature, endeavour to stamp New Year\u2019s Day with the particular image that I had formed of it; but in vain, I felt that it was not aware that people called it New Year\u2019s Day, that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me; in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills I had recognised, I had felt reappear the eternal, the universal substance, the familiar moisture, the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I returned to the house. I had spent the New Year\u2019s Day of old men, who differ on that day from their juniors, not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the New Year. Presents I had indeed received, but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure, namely a line from Gilberte. I was young still, none the less, since I had been able to write her one, by means of which I hoped, in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing, to arouse similar dreams in her. The sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters, the futility of which their experience has shewn\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After I was in bed, the noises of the street, unduly prolonged upon this festive evening, kept me awake. I thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure, of the lover, the troop, it might be, of debauchees who would be going to meet Berma at the stage-door after the play that I had seen announced for this evening. I was not even able, so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night, to assure myself that Berma was not, perhaps, thinking about love, since the lines that she was reciting, which she had long and carefully rehearsed, reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing, as of course she already knew, and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs \u2014 only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness \u2014 to her astonished audience; and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself. I lighted my candle again, to look once more upon her face. At the thought that it was, no doubt, at that very moment being caressed by those men whom I could not prevent from giving to Berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague, I felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous, a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn, as one hears it on the nights of the Lenten carnival and often of other public holidays, which, because it then lacks all poetry, is more saddening, coming from a toy squeaker, than \u201cat evening, in the depth of the woods.\u201d At that moment, a message from Gilberte would perhaps not have been what I wanted. Our desires cut across one another\u2019s paths, and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I continued to go to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es on fine days, along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed (because exhibitions of water-colours were then at the height of fashion) in a lightly floating atmosphere. It would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of Gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty, or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses. I found more style, and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the Palais de l\u2019Industrie at any rate in the Troca-d\u00e9ro. Plunged in a restless sleep, my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling, and I had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the Rue Royale, just as I should have been astonished to learn that the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Porte-Saint-Denis, those glories of the age of Louis XIV, were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names. Once only one of Gabriel\u2019s palaces made me stop for more than a moment; that was because, night having fallen, its columns, dematerialised by the moonlight, had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard, and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile Gilberte never came to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. And yet it was imperative that I should see her, for I could not so much as remember what she was like. The questing, anxious, exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love, our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow, and, until that word is uttered, our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair, all these make our observation, in the beloved object\u2019s presence, too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her. Perhaps, also, that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is over-indulgent to the thousand forms, to the changing fragrance, to the movements of the living person whom as a rule, when we are not in love, we regard as fixed in one permanent position. Whereas the beloved model does not stay still; and our mental photographs of her are always blurred. I did not rightly know how Gilberte\u2019s features were composed, save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me; I could remember nothing but her smile. And not being able to see again that beloved face, despite every effort that I might make to recapture it, I would be disgusted to find, outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail, the meaningless, emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barley-sugar woman; just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep, are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world. In their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief. And I was not far from believing that, since I could not recall the features of Gilberte, I had forgotten Gilberte herself, and no longer loved her. At length she returned to play there almost every day, setting before me fresh pleasures to desire, to demand of her for the morrow, indeed making my love for her every day, in this sense, a new love. But an incident was to change once again, and abruptly, the manner in which, at about two o\u2019clock every afternoon, the problem of my love confronted me. Had M. Swann intercepted the letter that I had written to his daughter, or was Gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event, and so that I should be more prudent in future, a state of things already long established? As I was telling her how greatly I admired her father and mother, she assumed that vague air, full of reticence and kept secrets, which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do, her walks, drives, visits \u2014 then suddenly expressed it with: \u201cYou know, they can\u2019t abide you!\u201d and, slipping from me like the Undine that she was, burst out laughing. Often her laughter, out of harmony with her words, seemed, as music seems, to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane. M. and Mme. Swann did not require Gilberte to give up playing with me, but they would have been just as well pleased, she thought, if we had never begun. They did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye; they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil. This type of unscrupulous young man whom the Swanns thought that I resembled, I pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved, flattering them to their faces but, when he was alone with her, making fun of them, urging her on to disobey them and, when once he had completed his conquest, not allowing them even to set eyes on her again. With these characteristics (though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself) how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to Swann, so passionate, on the contrary, that I never doubted that, were he to have the least suspicion of them, he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error. All that I felt about him I made bold to express to him in a long letter which I entrusted to Gilberte, with the request that she would deliver it. She consented. Alas! so he saw in me an even greater impostor than I had feared; those sentiments which I had supposed myself to be portraying, in sixteen pages, with such amplitude of truth, so he had suspected them; in short, the letter that I had written him, as ardent and as sincere as the words that I had uttered to M. de Norpois, met with no more success. Gilberte told me next day, after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels, along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs, that as he read my letter, which she had now brought back to me, her father had shrugged his shoulders, with: \u201cAll this means nothing; it only goes to prove how right I was.\u201d I, who knew the purity of my intentions, the goodness of my soul, was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of Swann\u2019s ridiculous error. For it was an error; of that I had then no doubt. I felt that I had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that, if Swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications, had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken, it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced, which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, perhaps it was simply that Swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them. Perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that I expressed for him simply an effect \u2014 and the strongest possible proof \u2014 of my love for Gilberte, by which, and not by any subordinate veneration of himself, my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled. I was unable to share his point of view, since I had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself, in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity, and thus suffering, experimentally, its consequences; I was in despair. I was obliged to leave Gilberte for a moment; Fran\u00e7oise had called me. I must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis, not unlike one of the disused toll-houses of old Paris, in which had recently been installed what in England they call a lavatory but in France, by an ill-informed piece of anglomania, \u2018water-closets.\u2019 The old, damp walls at the entrance, where I stood waiting for Fran\u00e7oise, emitted a chill and fusty smell which, relieving me at once of the anxieties that Swann\u2019s words, as reported by Gilberte, had just awakened in me, pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures, which leave one more unstable than before, incapable of retaining them, of possessing them, but, on the contrary, with a consistent pleasure on which I could lean for support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting, unexplained and certain. I should have liked, as long ago in my walks along the Guermantes way, to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me, and, remaining there motionless, to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an \u2018extra,\u2019 but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me. But the tenant of the establishment, an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig, was speaking to me. Fran\u00e7oise thought her \u2018very well-to-do indeed.\u2019 Her \u2018missy\u2019 had married what Fran\u00e7oise called \u2018a young man of family,\u2019 which meant that he differed more, in her eyes, from a workman than, in Saint-Simon\u2019s, a duke did from a man \u2018risen from the dregs of the people.\u2019 No doubt the tenant, before entering upon her tenancy, had met with reverses. But Fran\u00e7oise was positive that she was a \u2018marquise,\u2019 and belonged to the Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol family. This \u2018marquise\u2019 warned me not to stand outside in the cold, and even opened one of her doors for me, saying: \u201cWon\u2019t you go inside for a minute? Look, here\u2019s a nice, clean one, and I shan\u2019t charge you anything.\u201d Perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at Gouache\u2019s, when we went in there to order something, used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells, and which, alas, Mamma would never allow me to take; perhaps with less innocence, like an old florist whom Mamma used to have in to replenish her flower-stands, who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose. In any event, if the \u2018marquise\u2019 had a weakness for little boys, when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes, she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love, for I have never seen her with any other visitor except an old park-keeper\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A moment later I said good-bye to the \u2018marquise,\u2019 and went out accompanied by Fran\u00e7oise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide-and-seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same \u2018underhand,\u2019 brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. \u201cLook,\u201d she went on, \u201cdon\u2019t go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven\u2019t caught me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Had Swann appeared on the scene then before I had recovered it, this letter, by the sincerity of which I felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced, perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right. For as I approached Gilberte, who, leaning back in her chair, told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me, I felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that I said to her: \u201cLook! You try to stop me from getting it; we\u2019ll see which is the stronger.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She thrust it behind her back; I put my arms round her neck, raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders, either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young; and we wrestled, locked together. I tried to pull her towards me, she resisted; her cheeks, inflamed by the effort, were as red and round as two cherries; she laughed as though I were tickling her; I held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which I was trying to climb; and, in the middle of my gymnastics, when I was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game, I felt, as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort, my pleasure express itself in a form which I could not even pause for a moment to analyse; immediately I snatched the letter from her. Whereupon Gilberte said, good-naturedly:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, if you like, we might go on wrestling for a little.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which I had avowed, but too dimly to have been able to see that I had attained it. And I, who was afraid that she had seen (and a slight recoil, as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded), agreed to go on wrestling, lest she should suppose that I had indeed no other object than that, after which I wished only to sit quietly by her side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe\u2019s little sitting-room at Combray, which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere \u2018flute-player\u2019 and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have (or so they make out) seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any, despite the time-honoured phrase, to \u2018listening to their insides\u2019: they can hear so many things going on inside themselves, by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed, that they end by paying no attention to any of them. Their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help, as though from some serious malady, when it was merely because snow was coming, or because they had to change their rooms, that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable, although dying, of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health. One morning, bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities, from whose constant, internal circulation I kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood, I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table, and \u2014 having assured myself, as usual, that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that, for instance, one has received a scolding, and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain, and not that one ought not to eat anything \u2014 had taken my place between them when, in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet, a nausea, a giddiness stopped me, the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun, the symptoms of which had been masked, retarded by the ice of my indifference, but which obstinately refused the nourishment that I was not in a fit state to absorb. Then, at the same moment, the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that I was unwell gave me, as the instinct of self-preservation gives a wounded man, the strength to crawl to my own room, where I found that I had a temperature of 104, and then to get ready to go to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them, my eager thoughts were urging me towards, were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner\u2019s base with Gilberte, and an hour later, barely able to keep on my feet, but happy in being by her side, I had still the strength to enjoy it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fran\u00e7oise, on our return, declared that I had been \u2018taken bad,\u2019 that I must have caught a \u2018hot and cold,\u2019 while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he \u2018preferred\u2019 the \u2018severity,\u2019 the \u2018virulence\u2019 of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than \u2018a fire of straw,\u2019 to other forms, more \u2018insidious\u2019 and \u2018septic.\u2019 For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard\u2019s death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the \u2018euphoria\u2019 brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother\u2019s anxiety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an expression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it \u2018had a pain\u2019 in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, \u201cOh, my poor boy,\u201d she exclaimed, her face quivering with sympathy, \u201cyou are in dreadful pain.\u201d She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed \u2018put out\u2019 about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall leave you alone now, and let you get the good of this improvement,\u201d she said, rising suddenly to go. I detained her, however, for a kiss, and could feel on her cold cheek something moist, but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed. Next day, she did not come to my room until the evening, having had, she told me, to go out. I considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare, and I had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a \u2018feeding-up\u2019 process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxi-alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard\u2019s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. \u201cPurges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol.\u201d My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be \u2018built up,\u2019 that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard\u2019s eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good-humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one\u2019s tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: \u201cI am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You\u2019ll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; oll\u00e9, oll\u00e9!\u201d His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. \u201cAfter that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking \u2014 purges, injections, bed, milk!\u201d He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother\u2019s final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard\u2019s prescriptions to the letter; in three days my \u2018rattle\u2019 and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to \u2018imagine things,\u2019 had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a pretext so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: \u201cSo little boys don\u2019t tell Mamma their troubles any more?\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise used to come up to me every day with: \u201cWhat a face, to be sure! If you could just see yourself I Anyone would think there was a corpse in the house.\u201d It is true that, if I had simply had a cold in the head, Fran\u00e7oise would have assumed the same funereal air. These lamentations pertained rather to her \u2018class\u2019 than to the state of my health. I could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction. I decided provisionally that it was social and professional\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man\u2019s head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the \u2018t\u2019s\u2019 ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte\u2019s signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true existence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world. \u201cMy dear Friend,\u201d said the letter, \u201cI hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs-E\u00eeys\u00e9es. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I\u2019m having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Good-bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While I was reading these words, my nervous system was receiving, with admirable promptitude, the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me. But my mind, that is to say myself, and in fact the party principally concerned, was still in ignorance. Such good fortune, coming from Gilberte, was a thing of which I had never ceased to dream; a thing wholly in my mind, it was, as Leonardo says of painting, cosa mentale. Now, a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once. But as soon as I had finished reading the letter, I thought of it, it became an object of my dreams, became, it also, cosa mentale, and I loved it so much already that every few minutes I must read it, kiss it again. Then at last I was conscious of my happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Life is strewn with these miracles, for which people who are in love can always hope. It is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who, seeing that for some time past I had lost all interest in life, may have suggested to Gilberte to write to me, just as, when I was little and went first to the sea-side, so as to give me some pleasure in bathing, which I detested because it took away my breath, she used secretly to hand to the man who was to \u2018dip\u2019 me marvellous boxes made of shells, and branches of coral, which I believed that I myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea. However, with every occurrence which, in our life and among its contrasted situations, bears any relation to love, it is best to make no attempt to understand it, since in so far as these are inexorable, as they are unlooked-for, they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws. When a multi-millionaire \u2014 who for all his millions is quite a charming person \u2014 sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living, calls to his aid, in his desperation, all the resources of wealth, and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back, it is wiser for him, in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress, to suppose that Fate intends to crush him, and to make him die of an affection of the heart, than to seek any logical explanation. These obstacles, against which lovers have to contend, and which their imagination, over-excited by suffering, seeks in vain to analyse, are contained, as often as not, in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves, in her stupidity, in the influence acquired over her, the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know, in the kind of pleasures which, at the moment, she is demanding of life, pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover\u2019s wealth can procure for her. In any event, the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles, which her woman\u2019y cunning hides from him and his own judgment, falsified by love, prevents him from estimating exactly. They may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing, but without having traced them to their source. Like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary. Only they last, as a rule, longer than love itself. And as that is not a disinterested passion, the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman, neither rich nor virtuous, with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte\u2019s letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So far as concerns this letter, at the foot of which Fran\u00e7oise declined to recognise Gilberte\u2019s name, because the elaborate capital \u2018G\u2019 leaning against the undotted \u2018i\u2019 looked more like an \u2018A,\u2019 while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish, if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated, and which made me so radiantly happy, we may perhaps find that I was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which I should have supposed, on the contrary, to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the Swann family. A short while back, Bloch had come to see me at a time when Professor Cottard, whom, now that I was following his instructions, we were again calling in, happened to be in my room. As his examination of me was over, and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner, Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking, Bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that Mme. Swann was very fond of me, by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before, who was herself very intimate with Mme. Swann, I should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken, and to establish the fact (from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to M. de Norpois, and for fear of Mme. Swann\u2019s taking me for a liar) that I did not know her and had never spoken to her. But I had not the courage to correct Bloch\u2019s mistake, because I could see quite well that it was deliberate, and that, if he invented something that Mme. Swann could not possibly have said, it was simply to let us know (what he considered flattering to himself, and was not true either) that he had been dining with one of that lady\u2019s friends. And so it fell out that, whereas M. de Norpois, on learning that I did not know but would very much like to know Mme. Swann, had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me, Cottard, who was her doctor also, having gathered from what he had heard Bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me, concluded that to remark, when next he saw her, that I was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself, two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to Odette whenever an opportunity arose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus at length I found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that Mme. Swann used, though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar, disturbing charm that emanated from the life of Gilberte. The implacable porter, transformed into a benevolent Eumenid, adopted the custom, when I asked him if I might go upstairs, of indicating to me, by raising his cap with a propitious hand, that he gave ear to my prayer. Those windows which, seen from outside, used to interpose between me and the treasures within, which were not intended for me, a polished, distant and superficial stare, which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves, it fell to my lot, when in the warm weather I had spent a whole afternoon with Gilberte in her room, to open them myself, so as to let in a little air, and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side, if it was her mother\u2019s \u2018at home\u2019 day, to watch the visitors arrive who would often, raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages, greet me with a wave of the hand, taking me for some nephew of their hostess. At such moments Gilberte\u2019s plaits used to brush my cheek. They seemed to me, in the fineness of their grain, at once natural and supernatural, and in the strength of their constructed tracery, a matchless work of art, in the composition of which had been used the very grass of Paradise. To a section of them, even infinitely minute, what celestial herbary would I not have given as a reliquary. But since I never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits, if at least I had been able to have their photograph, how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by Vinci\u2019s pencil! To acquire one of these, I stooped \u2014 with friends of the Swanns, and even with photographers \u2014 to servilities which did not procure for me what I wanted, but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gilberte\u2019s parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now \u2014 when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat-stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood-box, whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann \u2014 Gilberte\u2019s parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow d\u2019e do?\u201d (They both pronounced it in the same clipped way, which, you may well imagine, once I was back at home, I made an incessant and delightful practice of copying.) \u201cDoes Gilberte know you\u2019re here? She does? Then I\u2019ll leave you to her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Better still, the tea-parties themselves to which Gilberte invited her friends, parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself, became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines, written (because I was still a comparative stranger) upon sheets that were always different. One was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue, above a fantastic inscription in English with an exclamation mark after it; another was stamped with an anchor, or with the monogram G. S. preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page, or else with the name Gilberte, now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend\u2019s signature and ended in a flourish, beneath an open umbrella printed in black, now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a Chinaman\u2019s hat, which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them. At last, as the series of different writing-papers which Gilberte possessed, numerous as it might be, was not unlimited, after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam, and over it the man\u2019s head in a helmet, set in a medallion of tarnished silver. And each of them was chosen, on one day rather than another, by virtue of a certain ritual, as I then supposed, but more probably, as I now think, because she tried to remember which of them she had already used, so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents, of those at least whom she took special pains to please, save at the longest possible intervals. As, on account of the different times of their lessons, some of the friends whom Gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving, while I was still on the stairs I could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which, such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which I was to take part, long before I had reached the landing, broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life, so that I did not even remember that I was to take off my muffler as soon as I felt too hot, and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home. That staircase, besides, a\u00eel of wood, as they were built about that time in certain houses, in keeping with that Henri II style which had for so long been Odette\u2019s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it, and furnished with a placard, to which there was no equivalent at home, on which one read the words: \u201cNOTICE. The lift must not be taken downstairs,\u201d seemed to me a thing so marvellous that I told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by M. Swann. My regard for the truth was so great that I should not have hesitated to give them this information even if I had known it to be false, for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the Swanns\u2019 staircase the same respect that I felt myself. It was just as, when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists, it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head. But since I had no power of observation, since, as a general rule, I never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes, and could understand only that when they were connected with the Swanns they must be extraordinary, I was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase I was guilty of falsehood. It did not seem certain; but it must have seemed probable, for I felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with: \u201cI know those houses; I have been in one; they are all alike; Swann just has several floors in one; it was Berlier built them all.\u201d He added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them, but that he had changed his mind, finding that they were not conveniently arranged, and that the landings were too dark. So he said; but I felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the Swanns and to my own happiness, and by a stroke of internal authority, in spite of what I had just heard, I banished for ever from my memory, as a good Catholic banishes Renan\u2019s Vie de J\u00e9sus, the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile on those tea-party days, pulling myself up the staircase step by step, reason and memory already cast off like outer garments, and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes, I would arrive in the zone in which the scent of Mme. Swann greeted my nostrils. I felt that I could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake, encircled by plates heaped with little cakes, and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them, as required by convention but peculiar to the Swanns. But this unalterable and governed whole seemed, like Kant\u2019s necessary universe, to depend on a supreme act of free will. For when we were all together in Gilberte\u2019s little sitting-room, suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say! It\u2019s getting a long time since luncheon, and we aren\u2019t having dinner till eight. I feel as if I could eat something. What do you say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And she would make us go into the dining-room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental styje. She asked me even at what o\u2019clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making \u2018my\u2019 tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. Which explains why my mother used always to say: \u201cWhat a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms\u2019 without coming home ill.\u201d But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns\u2019, that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present, that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gilberte\u2019s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up one\u2019s mind. Some of them refused tea! Then Gilberte would say, using a phrase highly fashionable that year: \u201cI can see I\u2019m not having much of a success with my tea!\u201d And to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony, she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table, with: \u201cWe look just like a wedding breakfast. Good lord, what fools servants are!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She nibbled her cake, perched sideways upon a cross-legged seat placed at an angle to the table. And then, just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother, when Mme. Swann, whose \u2018day\u2019 coincided as a rule with Gilberte\u2019s tea-parties, had shewn one of her visitors to the door, and came sweeping in, a moment later, dressed sometimes in blue velvet, more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace, she would say with an air of astonishment: \u201cI say, that looks good, what you\u2019ve got there. It makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Mamma, do! We invite you!\u201d Gilberte would answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ####\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you, no, my precious; what would my visitors say? I\u2019ve still got Mme. Trombert and Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps; you know dear Mme. Bontemps never pays very short visits, and she has only just come. What would all those good people say if I never went back to them? If no one else calls, I\u2019ll come in again and have a chat with you (which will be far more amusing) after they\u2019ve all gone. I really think I\u2019ve earned a little rest; I have had forty-five different people to-day, and forty-two of them told me about G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s picture! But you must come alone one of these days,\u201d she turned to me, \u201cand take \u2018your\u2019 tea with Gilberte. She will make it for you just as you like it, as you have it in your own little \u2018studio,\u2019\u201d she went on, flying off to her visitors, as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits (such as the habit that I should have had of taking tea, had I ever taken it; as for my \u2018studio,\u2019 I was uncertain whether I had one or not) that I had come to seek in this mysterious world. \u201cWhen can you come? To-morrow? We will make you \u2018toast\u2019 every bit as good as you get at Colombin\u2019s. No? You are horrid!\u201d\u2014 for, since she also had begun to form a salon, she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin\u2019s mannerisms, and notably her tone of petulant autocracy. \u2018Toast\u2019 being as incomprehensible to me as \u2018Colombin\u2019s,\u2019 this further promise could not add to my temptation. It will appear stranger still, now that everyone uses such expressions \u2014 and perhaps even at Combray they are creeping in \u2014 that I had not at first understood of whom Mme. Swann was speaking when I heard her sing the praises of our old \u2018nurse.\u2019 I did not know any English; I gathered, however, as she went on that the word was intended to denote Fran\u00e7oise. I who, in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make, I now learned from Mme. Swann that it was all the things that Gilberte had told them about my \u2018nurse\u2019 that had attracted her husband and her to me. \u201cOne feels that she is so devoted to you; she must be nice!\u201d (At once my opinion of Fran\u00e7oise was diametrically changed. By the same token, to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential.) Finally I learned from some words which Mme. Swann let fall with regard to Mme. Blatin (whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits) that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than I had supposed, and would not in any way have improved my standing with the Swanns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I had now begun to explore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one\u2019s so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne-room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over-burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann\u2019s butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie-pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular expression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as \u2018putting a name to a face,\u2019 though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann\u2019s library, it was the attachment to those objects \u2014 which might have been the ugliest in the world \u2014 of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver-backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing-room a fragrance exquisitely sweet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the \u2018good friends\u2019 at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the \u2018little clan\u2019 heard its \u2018Mistress\u2019 do, at the moments when she \u2018led the conversation.\u2019 The expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know (it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person\u2019s name), at another time others more plebeian (such as \u201cIt\u2019s a mere nothing!\u201d the favourite expression of one of her friends), and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the \u2018little clan,\u2019 she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, \u201cI do love that story!\u201d or \u201cDo admit, it\u2019s a verygood story!\u201d which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mme. Swann had left the dining-room, but her husband, who had just returned home, made his appearance among us in turn.\u2019 \u201cDo you know if your mother is alone, Gilberte?\u201d \u201cNo, Papa, she has still some people.\u201d \u201cWhat, still? At seven o\u2019clock! It\u2019s appalling! The poor woman must be absolutely dead. It\u2019s odious.\u201d (At home I had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long \u2018o,\u2019 like \u2018ode,\u2019 but M. and Mme. Swann made it short, as in \u2018odd.\u2019) \u201cJust think of it; ever since two o\u2019clock this afternoon!\u201d he went on, turning to me. \u201cAnd Camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people. Did I say a dozen? I believe he told me fourteen. No, a dozen; I don\u2019t remember. When I came home I had quite forgotten it was her \u2018day,\u2019 and when I saw all those carriages outside the door I thought there must be a wedding in the house. And just now, while I\u2019ve been in the library for a minute, the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word, it\u2019s given me quite a headache. And are there a lot of them in there still?\u201d \u201cNo; only two.\u201d \u201cWho are they, do you know?\u201d \u201cMme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps.\u201d \u201cOh! the wife of the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts.\u201d \u201cI know her husband\u2019s a clerk in some Ministry or other, but I don\u2019t know what he does.\u201d Gilberte assumed a babyish manner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that? You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; \u2018a clerk in some Ministry or other\u2019 indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what\u2019s more \u2014 what on earth am I thinking of? Upon my word, I\u2019m getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he\u2019s the Permanent Secretary.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?\u201d answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. (She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think it did \u2018mean a lot\u2019!\u201d exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more explicit mode of speech. \u201cWhy it means simply that he\u2019s the first man after the Minister. In fact, he\u2019s more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He\u2019s an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good-looking too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (This man\u2019s wife, incidentally, had married him against everyone\u2019s wishes and advica because he was a \u2018charming creature.\u2019 He had, what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole, a fair, silky beard, good features, a nasal voice, powerful lungs and a glass eye.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI may tell you,\u201d he added, turning again to me, \u201cthat I am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present Government, because they are Bontemps of the Bontemps-Chenut family, typical old-fashioned middle-class people, reactionary, clerical, tremendously strait-laced. Your grandfather knew quite well \u2014 at least by name and by sight he must have known old Chenut, the father, who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha\u2019penny, though he was a rich enough man for those days, and the Baron Br\u00e9au-Chenut. All their money went in the Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale smash \u2014 you\u2019re too young to remember that, of course \u2014 and, gad! they\u2019ve had to get it back as best they could.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons, in a class a long way below mine, the famous \u2018Albertine.\u2019 She\u2019s certain to be dreadfully \u2018fast\u2019 when she\u2019s older, but just now she\u2019s the quaintest spectacle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is amazing, this daughter of mine. She knows everyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I only used to see her going about, and hear them calling \u2018Albertine\u2019 here, and \u2018Albertine\u2019 there. But I do know Mme. Bontemps, and I don\u2019t like her much either.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are quite wrong; she is charming, pretty, intelligent. In fact, she\u2019s quite clever. I shall go in and say how d\u2019e do to her, and ask her if her husband thinks we\u2019re going to have war, and whether we can rely on King Theodosius. He\u2019s bound to know, don\u2019t you think, since he\u2019s in the counsels of the gods.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not thus that Swann used to talk in days gone by; but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman, and then, ten years later, tried to get back into society, and found that people were not very willing to call upon her; have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores, and, when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion, heard her say: \u201cShe came to see me only yesterday,\u201d or \u201cI live a very quiet life.\u201d So that it is superfluous to make a study of manners, since we can deduce them all from psychological laws\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends; a visit, an invitation, a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity. If bad luck would have it that the Verdurins were in London when Odette gave a rather smart dinner-party, arrangements were made by which some common friend was to \u2018cable\u2019 a report to them across the Channel. Even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by Odette the Swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves. They spoke of them to their friends, passed them from hand to hand. Thus the Swanns\u2019 drawing-room reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar \u2014 such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill-natured, failed to exasperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was \u2018of the same chapel\u2019 as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: \u201cAfter all, she\u2019s not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don\u2019t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive.\u201d \u201cOh, I do so entirely agree with you!\u201d the Duchess would respond. \u201cBesides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming.\u201d \u201cShe is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X\u2014\u2014\u201d (the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman) \u201cwho quotes twenty volumes at you.\u201d \u201cOh, but there isn\u2019t any comparison between them.\u201d The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice-minded; he extolled the merits of Mme. Bon-temps, as he had once extolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been excluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination (which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion) to exchange his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one\u2019s position is consolidated with one\u2019s person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our existence, we form or re-form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as Mme. Bontemps was concerned, I believe also that Swann, in speaking of her with so much emphasis, was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife. To tell the truth, in our house the names of the people whom Mme. Swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration. At the name of Mme. Trombert, my mother exclaimed: \u201cAh! That\u2019s a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.\u201d And as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary, rapid and violent manner in which Mme. Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial expedition, Mamma went on to observe: \u201cNow that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.\u201d If she had passed Mme. Swann in the street, she would tell us when she came home: \u201cI saw Mme. Swann in all her war-paint; she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the Massachutoes, or the Cingalese, or the Tromberts.\u201d And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society, to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings, Mamma would at once divine their origin, and, speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought, would say: \u201cBrought back from an Expedition against the so-and-so!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for Mme. Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: \u201cIn spite of the Professor\u2019s position, I must say that I cannot understand it.\u201d Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye-witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world (as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower) and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma (who inherited certain facets of her father\u2019s turn of mind) used to call the \u2018Tell Sparta\u2019 people. Besides \u2014 apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later \u2014 Mme. Swann, in inviting this good-natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawing-room, on her brilliant \u2018days,\u2019 a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card-case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature\u2019s power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope \u2014 in a general way \u2014 that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mme. Swann had, however, met with no success outside what was called the \u2018official world.\u2019 Smart women did not go to her house. It was not the presence there of Republican \u2018notables\u2019 that frightened them away. In the days of my early childhood, conservative society was to the last degree worldly, and no \u2018good\u2019 house would ever have opened its doors to a Republican. The people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an \u2018opportunist\u2019\u2014 still more, a \u2018horrid radical\u2019\u2014 to their parties was something that would endure for ever, like oil-lamps and horse-drawn omnibuses. But, like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable, and composes a fresh pattern. Before I had made my first Communion, ladies on the \u2018right side\u2019 in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting, while paying calls, a smart Jewess. These new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a \u2018change of criterion.\u2019 The Dreyfus case brought about another, at a period rather later than that in which I began to go to Mme. Swann\u2019s, and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish, even the smart lady herself, fell out of the pattern, and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place. The most brilliant drawing-room in Paris was that of a Prince who was an Austrian and ultra-Catholic. If instead of the Dreyfus case there had come a war with Germany, the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction, and its pattern reversed. The Jews having shewn, to the general astonishment, that they were patriots also, would have kept their position, and no one would have cared to go any more, or even to admit that he had ever gone to the Austrian Prince\u2019s. All this does not, however, prevent the people who move in it from imagining, whenever society is stationary for the moment, that no further change will occur, just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane. Meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work, castigating the preceding epoch, and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged, which seem to them to be the last word in corruption, but even the work of its artists and philosophers, which have no longer the least value in their eyes, as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity. The one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been \u2018great changes.\u2019 At the time when I went to Mme. Swann\u2019s the Dreyfus storm had not yet broken, and some of the more prominent Jews were extremely powerful. None more so than Sir Rufus Israels, whose wife, Lady Israels, was Swann\u2019s aunt. She had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew\u2019s, while he, since he did not care for her, had never much cultivated her society, although he was, so far as was known, her heir. But she was the only one of Swann\u2019s relatives who had any idea of his social position, the others having always remained in the state of ignorance, in that respect, which had long been our own. When, from a family circle, one of its members emigrates into \u2018high society\u2019\u2014 which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys \u2014 he draws round about himself a zone of shadow, a terra incognita, which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him, but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst. There being no news agency to furnish Swann\u2019s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted, it was (before his appalling marriage, of course) with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another, over family dinner-tables, that they had spent a \u2018virtuous\u2019 Sunday in going to see \u2018cousin Charles,\u2019 whom (regarding him as a \u2018poor relation\u2019 who was inclined to envy their prosperity,) they used wittily to name, playing upon the title of Balzac\u2019s story, Le Cousin B\u00eate. Lady Israels, however, was letter-perfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon Swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous. Her husband\u2019s family, which almost equalled the Rothschilds in importance, had for several generations managed the affairs of the Orleans Princes. Lady Israels, being immensely rich, exercised a wide influence, and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be \u2018at home\u2019 to Odette. One only had disobeyed her, in secret, the Comtesse de Marsantes. And then, as ill luck would have it, Odette having gone to call upon Mme. de Marsantes, Lady Israels had entered the room almost at her heels. Mme. de Marsantes was on tenter-hooks. With the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose, she did not address a single word to Odette, who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which, moreover, was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed. In this complete detachment of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate \u2018light woman,\u2019 utterly different from the respectable ladies, \u2018well up\u2019 in all the minutest points of genealogy, who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them. And Swann, for his part, continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive, for I have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies, without his attempting (whether from lingering affection for her, loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect) to correct them. It was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at Combray, and which now had the effect that, while he continued to know, on his own account at least, many highly distinguished people, he did not make a point, in conversation in his wife\u2019s drawing-room, of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance. They had, indeed, less than ever for Swann, the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced. In any case, Odette\u2019s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the Princesse de Guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the Duchess, her cousin, \u201cSo those ones are Princes, are they?\u201d she would exclaim; \u201cWhy, they\u2019ve gone up a step.\u201d Were anyone to say \u201cthe Prince,\u201d in speaking of the Duc de Chartres, she would put him right with, \u201cThe Duke, you mean; he is Duc de Chartres, not Prince.\u201d As for the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, son of the Comte de Paris: \u201cThat\u2019s funny; the son is higher than the father!\u201d she would remark, adding, for she was afflicted with anglomania, \u201cThoseRoyalties are so dreadfully confusing!\u201d\u2014 while to someone who asked her from what province the Guermantes family came she replied, \u201cFrom the Aisne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come expect people (so, at least, one supposed) to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once (for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old) but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short-sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti-semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for Swann himself, he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance, who, of course, were all of the very highest rank. And yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see I noticed that, among those whom he had known in the old days, the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste, partly artistic, partly historic, that inspired him as a collector. And remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation, who interested him because she had been the mistress of Liszt or because one of Balzac\u2019s novels was dedicated to her grandmother (as he would purchase a drawing if Chateaubriand had written about it) I conceived a suspicion that we had, at Combray, replaced one error, that of regarding Swann as a mere stockbroker, who did not go into society, by another, when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in Paris. To be a friend of the Comte de Paris meant nothing at all. Is not the world full of such \u2018friends of Princes,\u2019 who would not be received in any house that was at all \u2018exclusive\u2019? Princes know themselves to be princes, and are not snobs; besides, they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and \u2018business men\u2019 appear, in the depths beneath them, to be practically on a level\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These experiments in the lighter side (or what was to Swann the lighter side) of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife\u2019s friends. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me,\u201d he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards\u2019, when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced (to herself, of course) the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal \u2018Don Juan\u2019 spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. \u201cYes, we\u2019re determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,\u201d said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; \u201cMy husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction.\u201d For if she had retained from the \u2018little nucleus\u2019 certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain expressions, such as \u2018conjunction,\u2019 which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. \u201cYes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me. Don\u2019t you think that might be rather fun?\u201d asked Swann. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be exceedingly ill-assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn\u2019t to play with fire, is what I say!\u201d snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: \u201cOnly the Prince d\u2019Agrigente; it was all quite intimate.\u201d But there were others who might, alas, be better informed (once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: \u201cBut weren\u2019t the Bontemps there too?\u201d \u201cOh, I forgot them,\u201d Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil). For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. \u201cLet me see;\u201d Cottard would say, \u201cthere were our host and hostess, the Due and Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me \u2014\u201d (with a satisfied smile) \u201cProfessor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!\u201d Mme. Bontemps would recite an exactly similar \u2018piece,\u2019 only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vend\u00f4me and the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, while the \u2018also ran,\u2019 whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he had been paying calls Swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner. At that point in the evening, six o\u2019clock, when in the old days he had felt so wretched, he no longer asked himself what Odette might be about, and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her, or had gone out. He recalled at times that he had once, years ago, tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville. But this memory was not pleasing to him, and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace, twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding, if need be, a shake of the head which signified \u201cWhat does it all matter?\u201d In truth, he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by, according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of Odette \u2014 that this hypothesis (which after all was beneficent, since, so long as his amorous malady had lasted, it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary) was not the truth, that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light, and that if Odette had loved him better than he supposed, she had deceived him more as well. Formerly, while his sufferings were still keen, he had vowed that, as soon as he should have ceased to love Odette, and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did, he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her, simply from his love of truth and as a historical point, whether or not she had had Forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in, and she had written to Forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called. But this so interesting problem, of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided, had precisely lost all interest in Swann\u2019s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous. Not immediately, however. He felt no other jealousy now with regard to Odette than what the memory of that day, that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, had continued to excite in him; as though his jealousy, not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat, their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places, in certain houses, had had for its object not so much Odette herself as that day, that hour in the irrevocable past when Swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn. You would have said that that day, that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been Swann\u2019s, and that there alone could he now recapture them. For a long time now it had made no matter to him that Odette had been false to him, and was false still. And yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of Odette, so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day, so long ago, at six o\u2019clock, Odette had been in bed with Forcheville. Then that curiosity itself had disappeared, without, however, his abandoning his investigations. He continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him, because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically, following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that Swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish \u2014 so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it, that only the death of her whom he loved (death which, as will be shewn later on in this story, by a cruel example, in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy) seemed to him capable of making smooth the road, then insurmountably barred to him, of his life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But to bring to light, some day, those passages in the life of Odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been Swann\u2019s only ambition; he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when, being no longer in love with Odette, he should no longer be afraid of her; and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred, for Swann was in love with another woman, a woman who gave him \u2014 grounds for jealousy, no, but who did all the same make him jealous, because he was not capable, now, of altering his way of making love, and it was the way he had used with Odette that must serve him now for another. To make Swann\u2019s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful, it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him, at a party for instance, where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish, that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love, which held Swann ever at a distance from what she really was, like a yearning to attain the impossible (what this young woman really felt for him, the hidden longing that absorbed her days, the secret places of her heart), for between Swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions, having their cause in Odette, or in some other perhaps who had preceded Odette, allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the \u2018woman who made him jealous,\u2019 in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love. Often, however, Swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities; but then he would remember that he had given Odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong. And so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes. But whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife, he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere, so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her \u2014 of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself (for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with Odette that had been so necessary to him once), of those reprisals he took no more thought; with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer. And he who, when he was suffering at the hands of Odette, would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival, now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not only in those tea-parties, on account of which I had formerly had the sorrow of seeing Gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual, that I was henceforth to take part, but the engagements that she had with her mother, to go for a walk or to some afternoon party, which by preventing her from coming to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es had deprived me of her, on those days when I loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses \u2014 to these outings M. and Mme. Swann henceforth admitted me, I had a seat in their landau, and indeed it was me that they asked if I would rather go to the theatre, to a dancing lesson at the house of one of Gilberte\u2019s friends, to some social gathering given by friends of her parents (what Odette called \u2018a little meeting\u2019) or to visit the tombs at Saint-Denis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for d\u00e9jeuner, which Mme. Swann called \u2018le lunch\u2019; as one was not expected before half-past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet\u2019s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty-seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns\u2019 little garden-plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare-boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature (intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger) the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At half-past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. (The French name \u2018No\u00ebl\u2019 was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English \u2018Christmas,\u2019 and would speak of nothing but \u2018Christmas pudding,\u2019 what people had given them as \u2018Christmas presents\u2019 and of going away \u2014 the thought of which maddened me with grief \u2014\u2018for Christmas.\u2019 At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word \u2018No\u00ebl,\u2019 and always said \u2018Christmas,\u2019 which my father considered extremely silly.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawing-rooms shewed me into one that was quite small, empty, its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon; I was left alone there in the company of orchids, roses and violets, which, like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you, preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive, and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals, preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal, in a basin of white marble over which it spilled, now and again, its perilous rubies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had sat down, but I rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened; it was only another footman, and then a third, and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases. They departed, I found myself alone, once that door was shut which Mme. Swann was surely soon going to open. Of a truth, I should have been less ill at ease in a magician\u2019s cave than in this little waiting-room where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in Klingsor\u2019s laboratory. Footsteps sounded afresh, I did not rise, it was sure to be just another footman; it was M. Swann. \u201cWhat! All by yourself? What is one to do; that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means! Ten minutes to one. She gets later every day. And you\u2019ll see, she will come sailing in without the least hurry, and imagine she\u2019s in heaps of time.\u201d And as he was still subject to neuritis, and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous, the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife, who came in so late from the Bois, forgot everything at her dressmaker\u2019s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me, but my emotion, added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour, sweeping through my mind left it void, so that while able to speak I was incapable of hearing. Anyhow, so far as the works of art in Swann\u2019s possession were concerned, it was enough for me that they were contained in his house, formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon. The Gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of Mme. Swann\u2019s indoor gowns, or her scent bottles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must (so it seemed to me) be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer\u2019s leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter-skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink-tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing-room she would be clad in a wrapper of cr\u00eape-de-Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes the Swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon, and then, as we had had luncheon so late, very soon I must watch setting, beyond the garden-wall, the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days; then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape, burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console, a card-table, a corner-cupboard, a bracket, as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite; nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation, and I went home disappointed, as one often is in one\u2019s childhood after the midnight mass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing-room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall \u2018in front\u2019 and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green-room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a rule, however, we did not stay indoors, we went out. Sometimes, before going to dress, Mme. Swann would sit down at the piano. Her lovely hands, escaping from the pink, or white, or, often, vividly coloured sleeves of her cr\u00eape-de-Chine wrapper, drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart. It was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata that contained the little phrase of which Swann had been so fond. But often one listens and hears nothing, if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time. And yet when, later on, this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed, as one supposes, received no impression from the first hearing, the second, the third would be equally \u2018first hearings\u2019 and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth. Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall, a minute afterwards, what one has just been saying to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape, and, with regard to works which we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning. It was only that I had not, until then, heard a note of the sonata, whereas Swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void, a void from which, an hour later, when one is not thinking about them, will spring of their own accord, in one continuous flight, the syllables that one has solicited in vain. And not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great, but even in the content of any such work (as befell me in the case of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata) it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives. Thus it was that I was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me (so that for a long time I made no effort to hear it again) from the moment in which Mme. Swann had played over to me its most famous passage; I was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in Venice before the front of Saint Mark\u2019s, because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes. Far more than that, even when I had heard the sonata played from beginning to end, it remained almost wholly invisible to me, like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse. Hence the depression inseparable from one\u2019s knowledge of such works, as of everything that acquires reality in time. When the least obvious beauties of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata were revealed to me, already, borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility, those that I had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape, to avoid me. Since I was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me, I never possessed it in its entirety: it was like life itself. But, less disappointing than life is, great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best. In Vinteuil\u2019s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired, and for the same reason, no doubt, namely that they are less different from what one already knows. But when those first apparitions have withdrawn, there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition, too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind, had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact; and this, which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it, which has thus been held in reserve for us, which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown, this comes to us last of all. But this also must be the last that we shall relinquish. And we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it. The time, moreover, that a person requires \u2014 as I required in the matter of this sonata \u2014 to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome, a symbol, one might say, of the years, the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new. So that the man of genius, to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world, may say to himself that, since one\u2019s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment, works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone, like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them. But, as it happens, any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure; they are inevitable. The reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary, that few other men resemble him. It was Beethoven\u2019s Quartets themselves (the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth) that devoted half a century to forming, fashioning and enlarging a public for Beethoven\u2019s Quartets, marking in this way, like every great work of art, an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society, largely composed to-day of what was not to be found when the work first appeared, that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it. What artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art. It is essential that the work (leaving out of account, for brevity\u2019s sake, the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future, a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit) shall create its own posterity. For if the work were held in reserve, were revealed only to posterity, that audience, for that particular work, would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living half-a-century later in time. And so it is essential that the artist (and this is what Vinteuil had done), if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course, shall launch it, wherever he may find sufficient depth, confidently outward bound towards the future. And yet this interval of time, the true perspective in which to behold a work of art, if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges, taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good. No doubt one can easily imagine, by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant, that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules, whereas that which immediately confronts us, be it impressionism, a striving after discord, an exclusive use of the Chinese scale, cubism, futurism or what you will, differs outrageously from all that have occurred before. Simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole, forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance, varied of course but, taking it as a whole, homogeneous, in which Hugo blends with Moli\u00e8re. Let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find, if we did not take into account the future, and the changes that it must bring about, in a horoscope of our own riper years, drawn and presented to us in our youth. Only horoscopes are not always accurate, and the necessity, when judging a work of art, of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces, to our way of thinking, something as hazardous, and consequently as barren of interest, as every prophecy the non-fulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet\u2019s part, for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius; one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight, or, although a brilliant psychologist, in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me (like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums) to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. \u201cAttractive, isn\u2019t it, that Vinteuil sonata?\u201d Swann asked me. \u201cThe moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he expresses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil\u2019s little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: \u2018I can almost see to read the paper!\u2019\u201d These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it (which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul); was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had \u2014 feverish and moody as he then was \u2014 enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil\u2019s sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not (as the phrase had been) within him, and so had seen nothing \u2014 nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us (or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception) can be made externally visible. \u201cIt is rather charming, don\u2019t you think,\u201d Swann continued, \u201cthat sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil\u2019s phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values.\u201d \u201cCharles, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very polite to me, what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \u201cNot polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews \u2014 to me, at least \u2014 is not for a moment \u2018Free-will\u2019 or \u2018In Tune with the Infinite,\u2019 but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm-house at the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer.\u201d Mme. Swann laughed. \u201cThat is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,\u201d she explained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose existence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: \u201cI ought to explain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn\u2019t that so, Charles dear?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!\u201d Swann checked her, secretly flattered. \u201cBut I\u2019m only repeating what I\u2019ve been told. Besides, it seems that she\u2019s an extremely clever woman; I don\u2019t know her myself. I believe she\u2019s very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there\u2019s no harm in repeating that.\u201d Swann remained silent as a deaf-mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. \u201cSince what I\u2019m playing reminds you of the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation,\u201d his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, \u201cwe might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It\u2019s lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she\u2019s positively contagious.\u201d \u201cA frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo.\u201d This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is \u2014 as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved \u2014 something diffused and general, which can be found existing at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou\u2019s plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by \u2018walking on.\u2019 \u201cBut what has she got to do with the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation?\u201d \u201cEverything!\u201d \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t suggest that she\u2019s got a sky-blue behind, like the monkeys?\u201d \u201cCharles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering.\u201d \u201cWhat our good friends on the Thames call \u2018patronising,\u2019\u201d interrupted Odette. \u201cExactly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors \u2014 Cingalese, I think I heard my wife say; she is much \u2018better up\u2019 in ethnology than I am.\u201d \u201cNow, Charles, you\u2019re not to make fun of poor me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with \u2018Good morning, nigger!\u2019 . . . \u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s too absurd!\u201d \u201cAnyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. \u2018Me nigger,\u2019 he shouted (quite furious, don\u2019t you know), to Mme. Blatin, \u2018me nigger; you, old cow!\u2019\u201d \u201cI do think that\u2019s so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it\u2019s a good one. Can\u2019t you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: \u2018Me nigger; you, old cow\u2019?\u201d I expressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that All\u00e9e des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin\u2019s mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to \u2018get ready,\u2019 was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some \u2018work\u2019 for our stall-keeper in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. \u201cYou have no idea how kind-hearted she is, she won\u2019t let it be seen,\u201d her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife\u2019s grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall never know her, for a very good reason, and that is that she was not nice to her father, by what one hears, she gave him a lot of trouble. You can\u2019t understand that any more than I, can you; I\u2019m sure you could no more live without your papa than I could, which is quite natural after all. How can one ever forget a person one has loved all one\u2019s life?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, poor Papa, it is the anniversary of his father\u2019s death, just now. You can understand what he must be feeling; you do understand, don\u2019t you; you and I feel the same about things like that. So I just try to be a little less naughty than usual.\u201d \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t ever think you naughty. He thinks you\u2019re quite perfect.\u201d \u201cPoor Papa, that\u2019s because he\u2019s far too good himself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte \u2014 that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann (and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child), which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: \u201cBut you ought to know a great deal better than I do. You are in her confidence, her great favourite, her \u2018chum,\u2019 as the English say.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was, when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming, it completely hides that ideal, absorbing it in itself, as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide, so that there is but one, whereas we would rather, so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment, preserve for all those separate points of our desire, at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them, and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves, the distinction of being intangible. And our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it, for it has no longer a clear field: the acquaintance that we have made, the memory of those first, unhoped-for moments, the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness, and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination, they react more forcibly upon our past, which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account, than upon the form, still unshaped, of our future. I had been able to believe, year after year, that the right to visit Mme. Swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which I should never attain; after I had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawing-room, it was the period in which I did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible. How was I ever to dream again of her dining-room as of an inconceivable place, when I could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity, even ino my own most distant past, by the lobster \u00e0 l\u2019Am\u00e9ricaine which I had just been eating? And Swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon; for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed, to coincide and be lost in one another, not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed, but another still, that which his jealous love, as inventive as any fantasy of mine, had so often depicted to him, that dwelling common to Odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once, on evenings when Odette had taken him home with Forcheville to drink orangeade with her; and what had flowed in to be absorbed, for him, in the walls and furniture of the dining-room in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhoped-for paradise in which, in the old days, he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words, \u201cIs Madame ready yet?\u201d which I now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with self-satisfaction. No more than, probably, Swann himself could I succeed in knowing my own happiness, and when Gilberte once broke out: \u201cWho would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners\u2019 base, without daring to speak to her, would one day be your greatest friend, and you would go to her house whenever you liked?\u201d she spoke of a change the occurrence of which I could verify only by observing it from without, finding no trace of it within myself, for it was composed of two separate states on both of which I could not, without their ceasing to be distinct from one another, succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze \u2014 while I sat waiting for them there alone \u2014 on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their existence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing-room which Swann (not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife\u2019s taste) found so incongruous \u2014 because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans \u2014 it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that exist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give expression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated \u2014 equally disturbing and indefinite throughout \u2014 in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing-room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk-covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt \u2014 first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels \u2014 in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney-piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress \u2014 not heeding my protestations that no \u2018outdoor\u2019 clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of cr\u00eape-de-Chine or silk, old rose, cherry-coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte\u2019s friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often upon the paths of the Bois or the Jardin we passed, we were greeted by some great lady who was Swann\u2019s friend, whom he perchance did not see, so that his wife must rally him with a \u201cCharles! Don\u2019t you see Mme. de Montmorency?\u201d And Swann, with that amicable smile, bred of a long and intimate friendship, bared his head, but with a slow sweeping gesture, with a grace peculiarly his own. Sometimes the lady would stop, glad of an opportunity to shew Mme. Swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences, by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit, so thoroughly had Swann trained her in reserve. She had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society, and however smart, however stately the lady might be, Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing, she would introduce us, Gilberte and myself, with so much ease of manner, would remain so free, so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy, that it would have been hard to say, looking at them both, which of the two was the aristocrat. The day on which we went to inspect the Cingalese, on our way home we saw coming in our direction, and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort, an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons. \u201cAh! Here is someone who will interest you!\u201d said Swann. The old lady, who had come within a few yards of us, now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness. Swann doffed his hat. Mme. Swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady, who, standing there like a Winterhalter portrait, drew her up again and kissed her cheek. \u201cThere, there; will you put your hat on, you!\u201d she scolded Swann in a thick and almost growling voice, speaking like an old and familiar friend. \u201cI am going to present you to Her Imperial Highness,\u201d Mme. Swann whispered. Swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, with the Princess. \u201cThat is the Princesse Mathilde,\u201d he told me; \u201cyou know who\u2019 I mean, the friend of Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas. Just fancy, she\u2019s the niece of Napoleon I. She had offers of marriage from Napoleon III and the Emperor of Russia. Isn\u2019t that interesting? Talk to her a little. But I hope she won\u2019t keep us standing here for an hour! . . . I met Taine the other day,\u201d he went on, addressing the Princess, \u201cand he told me that your Highness was vexed with him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s behaved like a perfect peeg!\u201d she said gruffly, pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to Joan of Arc\u2019s contemporary, Bishop Cauchon. \u201cAfter his article on the Emperor I left my card on him with p. p. c. on it.\u201d I felt the surprise that one feels on opening the Correspondence of that Duchesse d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans who was by birth a Princess Palatine. And indeed Princesse Mathilde, animated by sentiments so entirely French, expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the Germany of an older generation, and was inherited, doubtless, from her Wuerttemberg mother. This somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened, as soon as she began to smile, with an Italian languor. And the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically \u2018Second Empire\u2019 that \u2014 for all that the Princess wore it simply and solely, no doubt, from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young \u2014 she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour, and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age. I whispered to Swann to ask her whether she had known Musset. \u201cVery slightly, sir,\u201d was the answer, given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question, and of course it was by way of a joke that she called Swann \u2018Sir,\u2019 since they were intimate friends. \u201cI had him to dine once. I had invited him for seven o\u2019clock. At half-past seven, as he had not appeared, we sat down to dinner. He arrived at eight, bowed to me, took his seat, never opened his lips, went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice. Of course, he was dead drunk. That hardly encouraged me to make another attempt.\u201d We were standing a little way off, Swann and I. \u201cI hope this little audience is not going to last much longer,\u201d he muttered, \u201cthe soles of my feet are hurting. I cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation. When we get home it will be she that complains of being tired, and she knows I simply cannot go on standing like this.\u201d For Mme. Swann, who had had the news from Mme. Bontemps, was in the course of telling the Princess that the Government, having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity, had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days\u2019 time, when the Tsar Nicholas was to visit the Invalides. But the Princess who, in spite of appearances, in spite of the character of her circle, which consisted mainly of artists and literary people, had remained at heart and shewed herself, whenever she had to take action, the niece of Napoleon, replied: \u201cYes, Madame, I received it this morning, and I sent it back to the Minister, who must have had it by now. I told him that I had no need of an invitation to go to the Invalides. If the Government desires my presence there, it will not be on the platform, it will be in our vault, where the Emperor\u2019s tomb is. I have no need of a card to admit me there. I have my keys. I go in and out when I choose. The Government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not. But if I do go to the Invalides, it will be down below there or nowhere at all.\u201d At that moment we were saluted, Mme. Swann and I, by a young man who greeted her without stopping, and whom I was not aware that she knew; it was Bloch. I inquired about him, and was told that he had been introduced to her by Mme. Bontemps, and that he was employed in the Minister\u2019s secretariat, which was news to me. Anyhow, she could not have seen him often \u2014 or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name, hardly \u2018smart\u2019 enough for her liking, of Bloch, for she told me that he was called M. Moreul. I assured her that she was mistaken, that his name was Bloch. The Princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her, while Mme. Swann gazed at it with admiring eyes. \u201cIt is only a fur that the Emperor of Russia sent me,\u201d she explained, \u201cand as I have just been to see him I put it on, so as to shew him that I\u2019d managed to have it made up as a mantle.\u201d \u201cI hear that Prince Louis has joined the Russian Army; the Princess will be very sad at losing him,\u201d went on Mme. Swann, not noticing her husband\u2019s signals of distress. \u201cThat was a fine thing to do. As I said to him, \u2018Just because there\u2019s been a soldier, before, in the family, that\u2019s no reason!\u2019\u201d replied the Princess, alluding with this abrupt simplicity to Napoleon the Great. But Swann could hold out no longer. \u201cMa\u2019am, it is I that am going to play the Prince, and ask your permission to retire; but, you see, my wife has not been so well, and I do not like her to stand still for any time.\u201d Mme. Swann curtseyed again, and the Princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile, which she seemed to have summoned out of the past, from among the graces of her girlhood, from the evenings at Compi\u00e8gne, a smile which glided, sweet and unbroken, over her hitherto so sullen face; then she went on her way, followed by the two ladies in waiting, who had confined themselves, in the manner of interpreters, of children\u2019s or invalids\u2019 nurses, to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations. \u201cYou should go and write your name in her book, one day this week,\u201d Mme. Swann counselled me. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t leave cards upon these \u2018Royalties,\u2019 as the English call them, but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes in those last days of winter we would go, before proceeding on our expedition, into one of the small picture-shows that were being given at that time, where Swann, as a collector of mark, was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held. And in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the South of France and Venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime, already well advanced, and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate Alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the Grand Canal. If the weather were inclement, we would go to a concert or a theatre, and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms. There, whenever Mme. Swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table, or even the waiters who brought our tea, to understand, she would say it in English, as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English \u2014 I only had not yet learned the language, and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make, on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it, remarks which I guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once, in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre, Gilberte gave me a great surprise. It was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back, on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather\u2019s death. We were to go, she and I, with her governess, to hear selections from an opera, and Gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance, and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do, with the comment that it might be anything in the world, no matter what, provided that it amused me and had her parents\u2019 approval. Before luncheon, her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day. This seemed to me only natural. Gilberte remained impassive, but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal; still she uttered not a word. When M. Swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear. He called Gilberte, and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte, so submissive, so loving, so thoughtful, would resist her father\u2019s appeal, on such a day and for so trifling a matter. At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: \u201cYou heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gilberte\u2019s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon, after which we retired to her room. Then suddenly, without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action: \u201cTwo o\u2019clock!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou know the concert begins at half past.\u201d And she told her governess to make haste\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut,\u201d I reminded her, \u201cwon\u2019t your father be cross with you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot the least little bit!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSurely, he was afraid it would look odd, because of the anniversary.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat difference can it make to me what people think? I think it\u2019s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment. We feel things for ourselves, not for the public. Mademoiselle has very few pleasures; she\u2019s been looking forward to going to this concert. I am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Gilberte,\u201d I protested, taking her by the arm, \u201cit is not to satisfy public opinion, it is to please your father.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct, I hope,\u201d she said sharply, plucking her arm away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, the Swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon-party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned (as, for instance, many years before, she had had her \u2018private hansom,\u2019 or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, \u2018To meet,\u2019 followed by the name of some more or less important personage). Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by \u2018Mr.\u2019. After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these \u2018pasteboards,\u2019 as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix \u2018Mr.\u2019. He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of \u2018Mr.,\u2019 if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon-party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing-room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with \u2018just a few people.\u2019 There were, however, sixteen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already \u2018named\u2019 me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it (in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other), pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance\u2019s sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick-set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail-shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, expressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood-vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased (I could see at once) to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail-shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self-satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail-shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: \u201cThanks, and you?\u201d before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up-to-date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: \u201cSame here!\u201d Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world (which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined). But in Bergotte\u2019s case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation (dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself), until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl-oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make-believe, whether the differences between one man\u2019s book and another\u2019s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall, which, however, I had completely forgotten. This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free-thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare. I was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bergotte was sitting not far from me and I could hear quite well everything that he said. I understood then the impression that M. de Norpois had formed of him. He had indeed a peculiar \u2018organ\u2019; there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying; the resonance of one\u2019s diphthongs, the energy of one\u2019s labials are profoundly affected \u2014 in fact, one\u2019s whole way of speaking. His seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing, and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books. But the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise, at first sight, a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker\u2019s literary style. At certain pobts in the conversation, when Bergotte, by force of habit, began to talk in a way which no one but M. de Norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant, it was a long time before I discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical. At those points I could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean, and as human speech reflects the human soul, though without expressing it as does literary style, Bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense, intoning certain words and, if he were secretly pursuing, beneath them, a single image, stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note, with a wearisome monotony. So that a pretentious, emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying, and an effect, in his conversation, of the same power which, in his books, produced that harmonious flow of imagery. I had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments, precisely because it was the authentic utterance of Bergotte, had not the appearance of being Bergotte\u2019s. It was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas, not included in that \u2018Bergotte manner\u2019 which so many story-tellers had appropriated to themselves; and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect \u2014 made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation, as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass \u2014 of the fact that when one read a page of Bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who, nevertheless, in newspapers and in books, adorned their prose with so many \u2018Bergottish\u2019 images and ideas. This difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by \u2018Bergottism\u2019 was, first and foremost, a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything, whence it was extracted by that great writer, by virtue of his genius, and that this extraction, and not simply the perpetration of \u2018Bergottisms,\u2019 was my sweet Singer\u2019s aim in writing. Though, it must be added, he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself, and because he was Bergotte, so that, in one sense, every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of Bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it. But if, for that reason, each of those beauties was related to all the rest, and had a \u2018family likeness,\u2019 yet each remained separate and individual, as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day; new, and consequently different from what was called the Bergotte manner, which was a loose synthesis of all the \u2018Bergottisms\u2019 already invented and set forth by him in writing, with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery. So it is with all great writers, the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen; it is creative, because it is applied to an external object of which, and not of their language or its beauty, they are thinking, to which they have not yet given expression. An author of memorials of our time, wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like Saint-Simon, might, on occasion, give us the first line of his portrait of Villars: \u201cHe was a rather tall man, dark . . . with an alert, open, expressive physiognomy,\u201d but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of Saint-Simon\u2019s next line, which begins with \u201cand, to tell the truth, a trifle mad\u201d? The true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements, in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward, against all reason, from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms, whereas the purely formal imitation of variety (and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style) is but a barren uniformity, that is to say the very antithesis of variety, and cannot, in the work of imitators, give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so \u2014 just as Bergotte\u2019s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish \u2014 so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over-rich, disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the \u2018eternal torrent of forms,\u2019 and of the \u2018mystic thrills of beauty.\u2019 Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in paradox, so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. (After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it.) So when Bergotte \u2014 and his figures appear simple enough to-day \u2014 said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that \u201cto him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,\u201d one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 >From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable (as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v\u2019s and s\u2019s and g\u2019s, which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments) corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words \u2014 often at such times quite insignificant \u2014 that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases, one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature, what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain peculiarities of elocution, faint traces of which were to be found in Bergotte\u2019s conversation, were not exclusively his own; for when, later on, I came to know his brothers and sisters, I found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech. There was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance, something faint and dying at the end of a sad one. Swann, who had known the Master as a boy, told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips, just as much as on his brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019, those inflexions, almost a family type, shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a long-drawn melancholy, and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part, better than any of them, in their symphonies, alternately deafening and subdued. However characteristic it may be, the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker. But it was not so with the pronunciation of the Bergotte family. For if it is difficult ever to understand, even in the Meistersinger, how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds, yet Bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy, or fall, drop by drop, in melancholy sighs. There are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged (as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end, and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton), in which, later on, I was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic \u2018brasses\u2019 of the Bergotte family. But in his own case, from the moment in which he transferred them to his books, he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech. From the day on which he had begun to write \u2014 all the more markedly, therefore, in the later years in which I first knew him \u2014 his voice had lost this orchestration for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These young Bergottes \u2014 the future writer and his brothers and sisters \u2014 were doubtless in no way superior, far from it, to other young people, more refined, more intellectual than themselves, who found the Bergottes rather \u2018loud that is to say a trifle vulgar, irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone, at once pretentious and puerile, of their household. But genius, and even what is only great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing, and so transforming them. To heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth\u2019s surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into ascending force. Similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest, but those who have had the power, ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves, to make use of their personality as of a mirror, m such a way that their life, however unimportant it may be socially, and even, in a sense, intellectually speaking, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected. The day on which young Bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood, and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers, on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family, more intellectual and more distinguished than himself; they in their fine Rolls Royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the Bergottes; but he, with his modest engine which had at last left the ground, he soared above their heads\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men \u2014 we shall come across some of whom this may be said \u2014 had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second-hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. \u201cAh, yes!\u201d he would exclaim, \u201cit is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is excellent!\u201d or again, \u201cOh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is excellent!\u201d As for style, he was not altogether of his time (though he remained quite exclusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky), for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was \u2018mild.\u2019 \u201cYes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atalathan in Ren\u00e9; he seems to me to be \u2018milder.\u2019\u201d He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s very \u2018mild\u2019.\u201d And it is true that there was in Bergotte\u2019s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration: \u201cI think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,\u201d but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, \u201cIt is comfortable,\u201d or \u201cShe is a good girl.\u201d But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: \u201cAfter all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country.\u201d So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A kind of austerity of taste which he had, a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was \u2018mild,\u2019 which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist, a chiseller of exquisite trifles, was on the contrary the secret of his strength, for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man, and the author who has more than once been patient to attain, in the expression of his thoughts, to a certain kind of attractiveness, in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent, just as if he yields too often to pleasure, to laziness, to the fear of being put to trouble, he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify, the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, \u2018believe\u2019 it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people (and yet he was not a snob), of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint-Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail-shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half-successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play-acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices (or merely the weaknesses and follies) of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte\u2019s time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly exalted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon \u2014 a brazen-faced denial of \u2014 the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance (touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden) of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate (that is to say in a casual encounter) he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another\u2019s grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and (like a miniature set in the floor of a casket) the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an expensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That first day on which I met him with Gilberte\u2019s parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Ph\u00e8dre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder \u2014 one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause \u2014 she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt may be sheer divination, and yet I fancy that she visits the museums. It would be interesting to \u2018establish\u2019 that.\u201d (\u2018Establish\u2019 was one of those regular Bergotte expressions, and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him, speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean the Cariatides?\u201d asked Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Bergotte, \u201cexcept in the scene where she confesses her passion to Oenone, where she moves her hand exactly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramic, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Ph\u00e8dre, . . . that one more . . . Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little sixth century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair \u2018frozen into marble,\u2019 yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling \u2018antique\u2019 this year.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues, the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in Berma\u2019s acting. I tried to picture her again in my mind, as she had looked in that scene in which I remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder. And I said to myself, \u201cThere we have the Hesperid of Olympia; there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the Acropolis; there is indeed nobility in art!\u201d But if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of Berma\u2019s gesture, Bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance. Then, while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes, at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality, I might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture. But of Berma in that scene all that I retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification, slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new, a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without. At this point Mme. Swann joined in the conversation, asking me whether Gilberte had remembered to give me what Bergotte had written aboutPh\u00e8dre, and adding, \u201cMy daughter is such a scatter-brain!\u201d Bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages, of no importance. \u201cBut it is perfectly charming, that little pamphlet, that little \u2018tract\u2019 of yours!\u201d Mme. Swann assured him, to shew that she was a good hostess, to make the rest of us think that she had read Bergotte\u2019s essay, and also because she liked not merely to flatter Bergotte, but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote, to control his writing. And it must be admitted that she did inspire him, though not in the way that she supposed. But when all is said there is, between what constituted the smartness of Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room and a whole side of Bergotte\u2019s work, so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men to-day, as a commentary upon the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been. Often Bergotte disagreed, but he allowed me to go on talking. I told him that I had liked the green light which was turned on when Phaedra raised her arm. \u201cAh! The designer will be glad to hear that; he is a real artist. I shall tell him you liked it, because he is very proud of that effect. I must say, myself, that I do not care for it very much, it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour, little Phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium. You will tell me, of course, that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play. That is quite true. All the same, it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the Court of Neptune. Oh yes, of course, I know the Vengeance of Neptune does come into the play. I don\u2019t suggest for a moment that we should think only of Port-Royal, but after all the story that Racine tells us is not the \u2018Loves of the Sea-Urchins.\u2019 Still, it is what my friend wished to have, and it is very well done, right or wrong, and it\u2019s really quite pretty when you come to look at it. Yes, so you liked that, did you; you understood what it meant, of course; we feel the same about it, don\u2019t we, really; it is a trifle unbalanced, what he\u2019s done, you agree with me, but on the whole it is very clever of him.\u201d And so, when Bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own, he in no way reduced me to silence, to the impossibility of framing any reply, as M. de Norpois would have done. This does not prove that Bergotte\u2019s opinions were of less value than the Ambassador\u2019s; far from it. A powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it. Being itself a part of the riches of the universal Mind, it makes its way into, grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute, slips in among the ideas already there, with the help of which, gaining a little ground, he completes and corrects it; so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion. It is to ideas which are not, properly speaking, ideas at all, to ideas which, founded upon nothing, can find no support, no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary, that he, grappling with something which is not there, can find no word to say in answer. The arguments of M. de Norpois (in the matter of art) were unanswerable simply because they were without reality\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. \u201cBut he\u2019s an old parrot!\u201d was the answer. \u201cHe keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you\u2019re a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle-fish.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Swann. \u201cAre you a friend of Norpois?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s as dull as a wet Sunday,\u201d interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte\u2019s judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. \u201cI tried to make him talk after dinner; I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to \u2018dope\u2019 him.\u201d \u201cYes, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Bergotte chimed in. \u201cYou see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt-front down and his white waistcoat up.\u201d \u201cI think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,\u201d came from Swann, who took the \u2018line,\u2019 in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. \u201cI quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,\u201d (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of \u2018real life\u2019) \u201che is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,\u201d he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, \u201che had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I\u2019m sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, \u2018beneath\u2019 them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them.\u201d As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this maxim to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill-will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine (according to a story the truth of which has been exploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life) made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But as a theory requires to be stated as a whole, Swann, after this momentary irritation, and after wiping his eyeglass, finished saying what was in his mind in these words, words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning, which I had not had the sense to take: \u201cThe danger of that kind of love, however, is that the woman\u2019s subjection calms the man\u2019s jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting. After a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night, to prevent their escaping. And that generally ends in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I reverted to M. de Norpois. \u201cYou must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!\u201d said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been \u2018saying things\u2019 about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile Gilberte, who had been told to go and get ready for our drive, stayed to listen to the conversation, and hovered between her mother and her father, leaning affectionately against his shoulder. Nothing, at first sight, could be in greater contrast to Mme. Swann, who was dark, than this child with her red hair and golden skin. But after looking at them both for a moment one saw in Gilberte many of the features \u2014 for instance, the nose cut short with a sharp, unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations \u2014 the expression, the movements of her mother; to take an illustration from another form of art, she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of Mme. Swann, whom the painter, to carry out some whim of colouring, had posed in a partial disguise, dressed to go out to a party in Venetian \u2018character.\u2019 And as not merely was she wearing a fair wig, but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which, stripped of its veil of brownness, seemed more naked, covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun, this \u2018make-up\u2019 was not just superficial but was incarnate in her; Gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise. This reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had, when Gilberte was being created, to solve the problem of how to reconstruct Mme. Swann piecemeal, without any material at her disposal save the skin of M. Swann. And nature had utilised this to perfection, like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain, the knots of his wood in evidence. On Gilberte\u2019s face, at the corner of a perfect reproduction of Odette\u2019s nose, the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of M. Swann. It was a new variety ot Mme. Swann that was thus obtained, growing there by her side like a white lilac-tree beside a purple. At the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed. Now and then, when Gilberte smiled, one could distinguish the oval of her father\u2019s cheek upon her mother\u2019s face, as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend; this oval grew distinct, as an embryo grows into a living shape, it lengthened obliquely, expanded, and a moment later had disappeared. In Gilberte\u2019s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father; this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said, \u201cKeep it, to remind yourself of our friendship.\u201d But were one to put a question to Gilberte, to ask her what she had been doing, then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment, the uncertainty, the prevarication, the misery that Odette used in the old days to shew, when Swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which, in those days, drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation, as an incurious and prudent husband. Often in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es I was disturbed by seeing this look on Gilberte\u2019s face. But as a rule my fears were unfounded. For in her, a purely physical survival of her mother, this look (if nothing else) had ceased to have any meaning. It was when she had been to her classes, when she must go home for some lesson, that Gilberte\u2019s pupils executed that movement which, in time past, in the eyes of Odette, had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had, during the day, opened the door to one of her lovers, or was \u2014 at that moment in a hurry to be at some trysting-place. So one could see the two natures of M. and Mme. Swann ebb and flow, encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this M\u00e9lusine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is, of course, common knowledge that a child takes after both its-father and its mother. And yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that, of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child, and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it. Indeed, the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance. Of two sisters, one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother; the other, abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence, will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar; her mother\u2019s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence. With the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents. It is true that Gilberte was an only child, but there were, at the least, two Gilbertes. The two natures, her father\u2019s and her mother\u2019s, did more than just blend themselves in her; they disputed the possession of her \u2014 and yet one cannot exactly say that, which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other, and at any given moment no more than one of the two, that is to say incapable, when she was not being good, of suffering accordingly, the better Gilberte not being able at the time, on account of her momentary absence, to detect the other\u2019s lapse from virtue. And so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind. When the other spoke to you from the heart of her father, she held broad views, you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise; you told her so, but, just as your arrangements were being completed, her mother\u2019s heart would already have resumed its control; hers was the voice that answered; and you were disappointed and vexed \u2014 almost baffled, as in the face of a substitution of one person for another \u2014 by an unworthy thought, an insincere laugh, in which Gilberte saw no harm, for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was. Indeed, the disparity was at times so great between these two Gilbertes that you asked yourself, though without finding an answer, what on earth you could have said or done to her, last time, to find her now so different. When she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere, not only did she fail to appear, and offer no excuse afterwards, but, whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind, she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that, taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of theMenaechmi, you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you, had she not shewn signs of an ill-humour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong, and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow then, run along and get ready; you\u2019re keeping us waiting,\u201d her mother reminded her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,\u201d replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something-else, n\u00e9eSwann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte\u2019s caress with a \u201cGood girl!\u201d in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Oenone, \u201cYou knew it!\u201d He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to exist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma\u2019s credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word \u2018discover\u2019 when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one\u2019s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUpon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!\u201d Swann observed to me, as though to excuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. \u201cIt seems to me that we\u2019re talking a great deal of art,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut it\u2019s so nice, I do love it!\u201d said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before (in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself), the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me express those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind\u2019s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books, an excerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest experience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest experience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this (though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds expressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving). I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte. He\u2019s been telling Mamma that he found you extremely intelligent.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked her. \u201cOh, wherever you like; you know, it\u2019s all the same to me.\u201d But since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather\u2019s death I had begun to ask myself whether Gilberte\u2019s character was not other than I had supposed, whether that indifference to what was to be done, that wisdom, that calm, that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her self-esteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated. As Bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents, we left the house together; in the carriage he spoke to me of my health. \u201cOur friends were telling me that you had been ill. I am very sorry. And yet, after all, I am not too sorry, because I can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind, and they are probably what mean most to you, as to everyone who has known them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alas, what he was saying, how little, I felt, did it apply to myself, whom all reasoning, however exalted it might be, left cold, who was happy only in moments of pure idleness, when I was comfortable and well; I felt how purely material was everything that I desired in life, and how easily I could dispense with the intellect. As I made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources, of varying depth and permanence, I was thinking, when the moment came to answer him, that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes, and often came across, as in the old toll-house in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, a chilly smell that would remind me of Combray. But in this ideal existence which I dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me; it is not them that I seek after; indeed I don\u2019t even know that I have ever tasted them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou really think not?\u201d he replied. \u201cWell, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best, I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As certainly, he did not succeed in convincing me; and yet I was already feeling happier, less restricted. After what M. de Norpois had said to me, I had regarded my moments of dreaming, of enthusiasm, of self-confidence as purely subjective and barren of truth. But according to Bergotte, who appeared to understand my case, it seemed that it was quite the contrary, that the symptom I ought to disregard was, in fact, my doubts, my disgust with myself. Moreover, what he had said about M. de Norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which I had supposed that no appeal was possible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you being properly looked after?\u201d Bergotte asked me. \u201cWho is treating you?\u201d I told him that I had seen, and should probably go on seeing, Cottard. \u201cBut that\u2019s not at all the sort of man you want!\u201d he told me. \u201cI know nothing about him as a doctor. But I\u2019ve met him at Mme. Swann\u2019s. The man\u2019s an imbecile. Even supposing that that doesn\u2019t prevent his being a good doctor, which I hesitate to believe, it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists, for men of intelligence. People like you must have suitable doctors, I would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves. Cottard will bore you, and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect. Besides, the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any Tom, Dick or Harry. Nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect. They need at least a doctor who understands their disease. How do you expect that Cottard should be able to treat you, he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces, for gastric trouble, but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading Shakespeare. So that his calculations are inaccurate in your case, the balance is upset; you see, always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it, since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there, reflected in his glasses.\u201d This manner of speaking tired me greatly; I said to myself, with the stupidity of common sense: \u201cThere is no more any dilated stomach reflected in Professor Cottard\u2019s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of M. de Norpois.\u201d \u201cI should recommend you, instead,\u201d went on Bergotte, \u201cto consult Dr. du Boulbon, who is quite an intelligent man.\u201d \u201cHe is a great admirer of your books,\u201d I replied. I saw that Bergotte knew this, and I decided that kindred spirits soon come together, that one has few really \u2018unknown friends.\u2019 What Bergotte had said to me with respect to Cottard impressed me, while running contrary to everything that I myself believed. I was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore; I expected of him that, thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me, he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle, after consultation of my entrails. And I did not at all require that, with the aid of an intellect, in which I easily outstripped him, he should seek to understand my intellect, which I pictured to myself merely as a means, of no importance in itself, of trying to attain to certain external verities. I doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles, and I was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that is our friend Swann,\u201d said Bergotte. And on my asking whether he was ill, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see, he\u2019s typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day, from women who refuse to meet his wife, or men who were there before him. You can see them in his mouth, writhing. Just look, any day you\u2019re there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who\u2019s in the room.\u201d The malice with which Bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which, in that house, he had constantly been adopting to speak to them. Certainly a person like my great-aunt, for instance, would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which I had heard Bergotte lavishing upon Swann. Even to the people whom she liked, she enjoyed saying disagreeable things. But behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened. There was nothing less like the social \u2018world\u2019 than our society at Combray. The Swanns\u2019 house marked a stage on the way towards it, towards its inconstant tide. If they had not yet reached the open sea, they were certainly in the lagoon. \u201cThis is all between ourselves,\u201d said Bergotte as he left me outside my own door. A few years later I should have answered: \u201cI never repeat things.\u201d That is the ritual phrase of society, from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance. It is what I should have said then and there to Bergotte, for one does not invent all one\u2019s speeches, especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack. But I did not yet know the formula. What my great-aunt, on the other hand, would have said on a similar occasion was: \u201cIf you don\u2019t wish it to be repeated, why do you say it?\u201d That is the answer of the unsociable, of the quarrelsome. I was nothing of that sort: I bowed my head in silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with Bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary, and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study, whereas I, I had now been installed among the friends of the great writer, at the first attempt and without any effort, like a man who, instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre, is shewn in at once to the best, having entered by a door that is closed to the public. If Swann had thus opened such a door to me, it was doubtless because, just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children\u2019s friends into the royal box, or on board the royal yacht, so Gilberte\u2019s parents received their daughter\u2019s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house, and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there. But at that time I thought, and perhaps was right in thinking, that this friendliness on Swann\u2019s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that, in view of my admiration for Bergotte, he should take me to dine with him, and that my parents had declined, saying that I was too young, and too easily excited to \u2018go out\u2019 yet. My parents, no doubt, represented to certain other people (precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous) something quite different from what they were to me, so that, just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy, I should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present I had just received, and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous Swann who had offered it to me, or to them rather, without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is, in Luini\u2019s fresco, the charming Mage with the arched nose and fair hair, to whom, it appeared, Swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, this favour that Swann had done me, which, as I entered the house, before I had even taken off my greatcoat, I reported to my parents, in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own, and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the Swanns, did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them. \u201cSwann introduced you to Bergotte? An excellent friend for you, charming society!\u201d cried my father, ironically. \u201cIt only wanted that!\u201d Alas, when I had gone on to say that Bergotte was by no means inclined to admire M. de Norpois:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI dare say!\u201d retorted my father. \u201cThat simply proves that he\u2019s a foolish and evil-minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I\u2019m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Already the mere fact of my frequenting the Swanns had been far from delighting my parents. This introduction to Bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake, namely their own weakness in controlling me, which my grandfather would have called a \u2018want of circumspection.\u2019 I felt that I had only, in order to complete their ill humour, to tell them that this perverse fellow who did not appreciate M. de Norpois had found me extremely intelligent. For I had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone, one of my school friends for instance, was going astray \u2014 as I was at that moment \u2014 if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high, he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment. The evil merely seemed to him more pronounced. I could hear him already exclaiming, \u201cOf course, it all hangs together,\u201d an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten. But since, were I not to tell them what Bergotte had said of me, even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed, that this should be made slightly worse mattered little. Besides, they seemed to me so unfair, so completely mistaken, that not only had I not any hope, I had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view. At the same time, feeling, as the words came from my lips, how alarmed they would be by the thought that I had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people, praise from whom, since it seemed to me a thing to be desired, would only encourage me in wrongdoing, it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that, coming to the end of my story, I flung them the bouquet of: \u201cHe told the Swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent.\u201d Just as a poisoned dog, in a field, rushes, without knowing why, straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed, so I, without in the least suspecting it, had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to Bergotte, a prejudice which all the best reasons that I could have urged, all the tributes that I could have paid him, must have proved powerless to defeat. Instantly the situation changed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! He said that he found you intelligent,\u201d repeated my mother. \u201cI am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! He said that, did he?\u201d my father joined in. \u201cI don\u2019t for a moment deny his literary distinction, before which the whole world bows; only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old Norpois made a guarded allusion, when he was here,\u201d he went on, not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which I had just repeated the depravity of Bergotte\u2019s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, my dear,\u201d Mamma interrupted, \u201cwe\u2019ve no proof that it\u2019s true. People say all sorts of things. Besides M. de Norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world, but he\u2019s not always very good-natured, especially about people who are not exactly his sort.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s quite true; I\u2019ve noticed it myself,\u201d my father admitted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,\u201d Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My mother had not, indeed, awaited this verdict from Bergotte before telling me that I might ask Gilberte to tea whenever I had friends coming. But I dared not do so for two reasons. The first was that at Gilberte\u2019s there was never anything else to drink but tea. Whereas at home Mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well. I was afraid that Gilberte might regard this as \u2018common\u2019; and so conceive a great contempt for us. The other reason was a formal difficulty, a question of procedure which I could never succeed in settling. When I arrived at Mme. Swann\u2019s she used to ask me: \u201cAnd how is your mother?\u201d I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCertainly not. I do not know Mme. Swann.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut neither does she know you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I was unconvinced, and preferred not to invite Gilberte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns\u2019 butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing-room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have \u2018taken in\u2019 to luncheon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness (which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch \u2014 for his \u2018good tidings\u2019 that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time \u2014 a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later \u2014 by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm \u2014 deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities): namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to \u2018Mediaeval Towns.\u2019 But the house to which Bloch led me (and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit), was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise (as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat) she would whisper: \u201cShe is a Jewess! Doesn\u2019t that make you want to?\u201d (That, by the way, was probably why the girl\u2019s name was Rachel.) And with a silly and affected excitement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: \u201cThink of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn\u2019t that be lovely? Rrrr!\u201d This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the \u2018boys\u2019 who were introduced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen-strokes upon a wash-drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed \u201cRachel when from the Lord.\u201d But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: \u201cThat\u2019s settled then; I shall be free to-morrow, if you have anyone you won\u2019t forget to send for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit, common to all of them, was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned. She would simply vary her formula, saying indifferently: \u201cIf you want me\u201d or \u201cIf you want anybody.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mistress, who was not familiar with Hal\u00e9vy\u2019s opera, did not know why I always called the girl \u201cRachel when from the Lord.\u201d But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole-hearted laugh that she would say to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen there\u2019s nothing doing to-night? When am I going to fix you up with \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019? Why do you always say that, \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019? Oh, that\u2019s very smart, that is. I\u2019m going to make a match of you two. You won\u2019t be sorry for it, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once I was just making up my mind, but she was \u2018in the press,\u2019 another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place (working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work), had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, anxious to present a token of my good-will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt L\u00e9onie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt\u2019s room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy-tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt L\u00e9onie had left her room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A whole lot more of my aunt L\u00e9onie\u2019s things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents\u2019 warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: \u201cIf I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this.\u201d How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that (which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all) of bestowing favours upon Gilberte\u2019s parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart\u2019s power of resistance has diminished\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no introspection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill-disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after next I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, external day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of relaxation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: \u201cWell, and that work of yours; aren\u2019t we even to speak of it now?\u201d I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: \u201cI am sorry; I shall not say anything again,\u201d and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, I said to myself, in spending all my time with the Swanns, am I not doing exactly what Bergotte does? To my parents it seemed almost as though, idle as I was, I was leading, since it was spent in the same drawing-room with a great writer, the life most favourable to the growth of talent. And yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself, from within himself, and can acquire it from some one else, is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health, in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses, merely by dining out often in the company of a physician. The person, by the way, who was most completely taken in by this illusion, which misled me as well as my parents, was Mme. Swann. When I explained to her that I was unable to come, that I must stay at home and work, she looked as though she were thinking that I made a great fuss about nothing, that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what I had said\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut Bergotte is coming, isn\u2019t he? Do you mean that you don\u2019t think it good, what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,\u201d she went on, \u201cfor he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I\u2019ve arranged that in future he\u2019s to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He\u2019ll be distinctly the \u2018right man in the right place\u2019 there.\u201d And, finally, \u201cCome! He will tell you, better than anyone, what you ought to do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of \u2018getting to know\u201d people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day, to meet Bergotte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so there was not from the Swanns any more than from my parents, that is to say from those who, at different times, had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way, any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which I might see Gilberte as often as I chose, with enjoyment if not with peace of mind. There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh starting-point for further desires. So long as I had not been free to go to her, having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness, I could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there. Once the resistance of her parents was broken, and the problem solved at last, it began to set itself anew, and always in different terms. Each evening, on arriving home, I reminded myself that I had things to say to Gilberte of prime importance, things upon which our whole friendship hung, and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy, and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness. One was to appear, alas, from a quarter in which I had never detected any peril, namely from Gilberte and myself. And yet I ought to have been tormented by what, on the contrary, reassured me, by what I mistook for happiness. We are, when we love, in an abnormal state, capable of giving at once to an accident, the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur, a serious-aspect which that accident by itself would not bear. What makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position, and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced. Actually, there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises, makes conditional only, procrastinates, but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking, sheer agony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On several occasions I felt that Gilberte was anxious to put off my visits. It is true that when I was at all anxious to see her I had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her. \u201cThanks to them,\u201d I used to think, \u201cmy love is running no risk; the moment I have them on my side, I can set my mind at rest; they have full authority over Gilberte.\u201d Until, alas, I detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house, almost against her will, and asked myself whether what I had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last time that I called to see Gilberte, it was raining; she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her. In view of the dampness of the air I had taken rather more caffeine than usual. Perhaps on account of the weather, or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given, Mme. Swann, as her daughter was leaving the room, called her back in the sharpest of tones: \u201cGilberte!\u201d and pointed to me, to indicate that I had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me. This \u2018Gilberte!\u2019 had been uttered, or shouted rather, with the best of intentions towards myself, but from the way in which Gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes I divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution, which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest, which was gradually drawing away from me my friend. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go out dancing every day,\u201d Odette told her daughter, with a sagacity acquired, no doubt, in earlier days, from Swann. Then, becoming once more Odette, she began speaking to her daughter in English. At once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of Gilberte, as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away. In a language that we know, we have substituted for the opacity of sounds, the perspicuity of ideas. But a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed, within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false, while we, standing without, desperately alert in our impotence, can see, can prevent nothing. So this conversation in English, at which, a month earlier, I should merely have smiled, interspersed with a few proper names in French which did not fail to accentuate, to give a point to my uneasiness, had, when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons, the same degree of cruelty, left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion. At length Mme. Swann left us. That day, perhaps from resentment against myself, the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself, perhaps also because, guessing her to be angry with me, I was precautionally colder than usual with her, the face of Gilberte, divested of every sign of joy, bleak, bare, pillaged, seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pas-de-quatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part, and to be defying every living creature, beginning with myself, to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston. She confined herself to exchanging with me, now and again, on the weather, the increasing violence of the rain, the fastness of the clock, a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables, in which I lashed myself on, with a sort of desperate rage, to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness. And on each of our remarks was stamped, as it were, a supreme harshness, by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance, which at the same time consoled me, for it prevented Gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone. In vain was my polite: \u201cI thought, the other day, that the clock was slow, if anything\u201d; she evidently understood me to mean: \u201cHow tiresome you are being!\u201d Obstinately as I might protract, over the whole length of that rain-sodden afternoon, the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone, I knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as I pretended, and that Gilberte must be fully aware that if, after already saying it to her three times, I had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in, I should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears. When she was like that, when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face, I cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features. Her face, grown almost livid, reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea, ebbing far out, wearies one with its faint shimmering, everywhere the same, fixed in an immutable and low horizon. At length, as I saw no sign in Gilberte of the happy change for which I had been waiting now for some hours, I told her that she was not being nice. \u201cIt is you that are not being nice,\u201d was her answer. \u201cOh, but surely \u2014\u2014!\u201d I asked myself what I could have done, and, finding no answer, put the question to her. \u201cNaturally, you think yourself nice!\u201d she said to me with a laugh, and went on laughing. Whereupon I felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other, less perceptible, plane of her mind which her laughter indicated. It seemed, that laughter, to mean: \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say, I know you\u2019re madly in love with me, but that leaves me neither hot nor cold, for I don\u2019t care a rap for you.\u201d But I told myself that, after all, laughter was not a language so well defined that I could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant. And Gilberte\u2019s words were affectionate. \u201cBut how am I not being nice?\u201d I asked her. \u201cTell me; I will do anything you want.\u201d \u201cNo; that wouldn\u2019t be any good. I can\u2019t explain.\u201d For a moment I was afraid that she thought that I did not love her, and this was for me a fresh agony, no less keen, but one that required treatment by a different conversational method. \u201cIf you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me.\u201d But this pain which, had she doubted my love for her, must have rejoiced her, seemed instead to make her more angry. Then, realising my mistake, making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said, letting her (without bothering to believe her) assure me: \u201cI do love you, indeed I do; you will see one day,\u201d (that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear, and which, for some mysterious reason, never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken), I had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again, and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth \u2014 as was now happening \u2014 at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever pretext, into Gilberte\u2019s presence. But she would have said to herself: \u201cBack again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he\u2019ll be.\u201d Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass-needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature (that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults), we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indis-pensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain \u2014 and one that is not localised and partial only \u2014 which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one-and-twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them-.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions, those \u2018nevermores\u2019 so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate \u2018nevermore\u2019 by \u2018this very evening, if you want me,\u2019 or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to examine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world\u2019s first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be \u2018objective\u2019 and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend\u2019s part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte\u2019s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that next day I would go to the Swanns\u2019, happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution) develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side, I might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns\u2019; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere), but because of the manner in which he said it. \u201cSir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady\u2019s maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once.\u201d These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte\u2019s household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte\u2019s society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning\u2019s post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another\u2019s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns\u2019 could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended \u2014 it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state \u2014 by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover\u2019s spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These expressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer (what a moment ago it would still have been), nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte (so far would her liking for me have regained its strength) my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to exist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not explain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once. In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that (in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her), whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and (on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es) used to repair to the All\u00e9e des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an exaggeration. How many times in an hour (but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns\u2019) did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the \u2018missing,\u2019 the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it. Each visit that I paid to Mme. Swann without seeing Gilberte was a cruel punishment, but I felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that Gilberte had of me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, if I always took care, before going to see Mme. Swann, that there should be no risk of her daughter\u2019s appearing, that arose, it is true, from my determination to break with her, but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her (very few of such intentions are absolute, at least in a continuous form, in this human soul of ours, one of whose laws, confirmed by the unlooked-for wealth of illustration that memory supplies, is intermittence), and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel. As for that hope, I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that, at any moment, a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune. We are all of us obliged, if we are to make reality endurable, to nurse a few little follies in ourselves. Now my hope remained more intact \u2014 while at the same time our separation became more effectual \u2014 if I refrained from meeting Gilberte. If I had found myself face to face with her in her mother\u2019s drawing-room, we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final, killed my hope and, on the other hand, by creating a fresh anxiety, reawakened my love and made resignation harder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ever so long ago, before I had even thought of breaking with her daughter, Mme. Swann had said to me: \u201cIt is all very well your coming to see Gilberte; I should like you to come sometimes for my sake, not to my \u2018kettledrums,\u2019 which would bore you because there is such a crowd, but on the other days, when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late.\u201d So that I might be thought, when I came to see her, to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past. And very late in the afternoon, when it was quite dark, almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner, I would set out to pay Mme. Swann a visit, in the course of which I knew that I should not see Gilberte, and yet should be thinking only of her. In that quarter, then looked upon as remote, of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day, where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses, the lamps of a drawing-room situated on the ground level, or but slightly raised above it, as were the rooms in which Mme. Swann generally received her visitors, were enough to lighten the street, and to make the passer-by raise his eyes, connecting with their glow, as with its apparent though hidden cause, the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams. This passer-by was led to believe, not without a certain emotion, that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause, when he saw one of the carriages begin to move; but it was merely a coachman who, afraid of his horses\u2019 catching cold, started them now and again on a brisk walk, all the more impressive because the rubber-tired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2018winter-garden,\u2019 of which in those days the passer-by generally caught a glimpse, in whatever street he might be walking, if the drawing-room did not stand too high above the pavement, is to be seen to-day only in photogravures in the gift-books of P. J. Stahl, where, in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the Louis XVI drawing-rooms now in fashion \u2014 a single rose or a Japanese iris in a long-necked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second \u2014 it seems, because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then, and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement, as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration. It suggested to one, only on a larger scale, in the houses of those days, those tiny, portable hothouses laid out on New Year\u2019s morning beneath the lighted lamp \u2014 for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight \u2014 among all the other New Year\u2019s presents but the loveliest of them all, consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves, those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time, portrayed in a delightful book, another of their presents, and one which, for all that it was given not to them but to Mlle. Lili, the heroine of the story, enchanted them to such a pitch that even now, when they are almost old men and women, they ask themselves whether, in those fortunate years, winter was not the loveliest of the seasons. And inside there, beyond the winter-garden, through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children\u2019s playthings, pictured or real, the passer-by, drawing himself up on tiptoe, would generally observe a man in a frock coat, a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole, standing before a seated lady, both vaguely outlined, like two intaglios cut in a topaz, in the depths of the drawing-room atmosphere clouted by the samovar \u2014 then a recent importation \u2014 with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still to-day, but to which, if it does, we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it. Mme. Swann attached great importance to her \u2018tea\u2019; she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man, \u201cYou will find me at home any day, fairly late; come to tea!\u201d so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of English accent, and which her listener duly noted, bowing solemnly in acceptance, as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention. There was another reason, apart from those given already, for the flowers\u2019 having more than a merely ornamental part in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, and this reason pertained not to the period, but, in some degree, to the former life of Odette. A great courtesan, such as she had been, lives largely for her lovers, that is to say at home, which means that she comes in time to live for her home. The things that one sees in the house of a \u2018respectable\u2019 woman, things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance, are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan. The culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see, but that in which she undresses herself for a man. She must be as smart in her wrapper, in her nightgown, as in her outdoor attire. Other women display their jewels, but as for her, she lives in the intimacy of her pearls. This kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret, that is to say which comes near to being disinterested. Mme. Swann extended this to include her flowers. There was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with Parma violets or with long white daisy-petals scattered upon the water, which seemed to be testifying, in the eyes of the arriving guest, to some favourite and interrupted occupation, such as the cup of tea which Mme. Swann would, for her own amusement, have been drinking there by herself; an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious, so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side, as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by \u2014 and so, perhaps, what was still in the mind of Odette. And unlike the book the flowers were living things; it was annoying, when one entered the room to pay Mme. Swann a visit, to discover that she was not alone, or if one came home with her not to find the room empty, so prominent a place in it, enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing, did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for Odette\u2019s visitors but, as it were, forgotten there by her, had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing, the secret of which one tried in vain to read, fastening one\u2019s eyes on the moist purple, the still liquid water-colour of the Parma violets. By the end of October Odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea, which was still known, at that time, as \u2018five-o\u2019clock tea,\u2019 having once heard it said, and being fond of repeating that if Mme. Verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour. She imagined that she herself had one also, of the same kind, but freer, senza rigore as she used to say. She saw herself figuring thus as a sort of Lespinasse, and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du Defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men, notably Swann himself, who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement, according-to a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends, ignorant of what had passed, though without convincing herself. But certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten. On days on which Mme. Swann had not left the house, one found her in a wrapper of cr\u00eape-de-Chine, white as the first snows of winter, or, it might be, in one of those long pleated garments of moussettne-de-soie, which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals, and would be regarded to-day as hardly suitable for winter, though quite wrongly. For these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman \u2014 in the stifling warmth of the drawing-rooms of those days, with their heavily curtained doors, rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were \u2018exquisitely cushioned\u2019\u2014 the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side, despite the winter, in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity, as though it were already spring. By reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets, and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat, the lady of the house, not being apprised of your entry as she is to-day, would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair, which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic, that charm of a sort of secret discovery, which we find to-day in the memory of those gowns, already out of fashion even then, which Mme. Swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded, and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of Henry Gr\u00e9ville\u2019s tales. Odette had, at this time, in her drawing-room, when winter began, chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as Swann, in the old days, certainly never saw in her drawing-room in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse. My admiration for them \u2014 when I went to pay Mme. Swann one of those melancholy visits during which, prompted by my sorrow, I discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that Gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow: \u201cYour friend came to see me yesterday,\u201d\u2014 sprang, no doubt, from my sense that, rose-pale like the Louis XIV silk that covered her chairs, snow-white like her cr\u00eape-de-Chine wrapper, or of a metallic red like her samovar, they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another, a supplementary scheme of decoration, as rich, as delicate in its colouring, but one which was alive and would last for a few days only. But I was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than, one might almost say, lasting, when I compared them with the tones, as pink, as coppery, which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a November afternoon, and which, after seeing them, before I had entered the house, fade from the sky, I found again inside, prolonged, transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers. Like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun, so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling, they invited me, those chrysanthemums, to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that \u2018tea-time\u2019 the too fleeting joys of November, of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory. Alas, it was not in the conversations to which I must listen that I could hope to attain to that glory; they had but little in common with it. Even with Mme. Cottard, and although it was growing late, Mme. Swann would assume her most caressing manner to say: \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not late, really; you mustn\u2019t look at the clock; that\u2019s not the right time; it\u2019s stopped; you can\u2019t possibly have anything else to do now, why be in such a hurry?\u201d as she pressed a final tartlet upon the Professor\u2019s wife, who was gripping her card-case in readiness for flight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne simply can\u2019t tear oneself away from this house!\u201d observed Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann, while Mme. Cottard, in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words, exclaimed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what I always say myself, what I tell my own little judge, in the court of conscience!\u201d winning the applause of the gentlemen from the Jockey Club, who had been profuse in their salutations, as though confounded at such an honour\u2019s being done them, when Mme. Swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman, who kept herself, when confronted with Odette\u2019s brilliant friends, in reserve, if not on what she herself called \u2018the defensive,\u2019 for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. \u201cI should never have suspected it,\u201d was Mme. Swann\u2019s comment, \u201cthree Wednesdays running you\u2019ve played me false.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite true, Odette; it\u2019s simply ages, it\u2019s an eternity since I saw you last. You see, I plead guilty; but I must tell you,\u201d she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty, for although a doctor\u2019s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys,\u201d that I have had a lot of little troubles. As we all have, I dare say. And besides that I\u2019ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics. I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies; still I\u2019ve been obliged, just to make an example you know, to give my Vatel notice; I believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place. But his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry. My own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer; oh, we have had some Homeric scenes. However I held fast to the reins through thick and thin; the whole affair\u2019s been a perfect lesson, which won\u2019t be lost on me, I can tell you. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m boring you with all these stories about servants, but you know as well as I do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one\u2019s household\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t we to see anything of your delicious child?\u201d she wound up. \u201cNo, my delicious child is dining with a friend,\u201d replied Mme. Swann, and then, turning to me: \u201cI believe she\u2019s written to you, asking you to come and see her to-morrow. And your babies?\u201d she went on to Mme. Cottard. I breathed a sigh of relief. These words by which Mme. Swann proved to me that I oould see Gilberte whenever I chose gave me precisely the comfort which I had come to seek, and which at that time made my visits to Mme. Swann so necessary. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not; I shall write to her, anyhow, this evening. Gilberte and I never seem to see one another now,\u201d I added, pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency, which gave me a further illusion of being in love, supported as well by the affectionate way in which I spoke of Gilberte and she of me. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s simply devoted to you,\u201d said Mme. Swann. \u201cReally, you won\u2019t come to-morrow?\u201d Suddenly my heart rose on wings; the thought had just struck me \u2014\u201cAfter all, why shouldn\u2019t I, since it\u2019s her own mother who suggests it?\u201d But with the thought I fell back into my old depression. I was afraid now lest, when she saw me again, Gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned, and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation. During these asides Mme. Bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians\u2019 wives, for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words, and to deplore her husband\u2019s official position. \u201cDo you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors\u2019 wives, like that, one after the other?\u201d she exclaimed to Mme. Cottard, who, unlike her, was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect. \u201cAh! you\u2019re a law-abiding woman! You see, in my case\u2019, at the Ministry, don\u2019t you know, I simply have to keep it up, of course. It\u2019s too much for me, I can tell you; you know what those officials\u2019 wives are like, it\u2019s all I can do not to put my tongue out at them. And my niece Albertine is just like me. You really wouldn\u2019t believe the impudence that girl has. Last week, on my \u2018day,\u2019 I had the wife of the Under Secretary of State for Finance, who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking. \u2018But surely, ma\u2019am,\u2019 my niece chipped in with her most winning smile, \u2018you ought to know everything about it, after all the dishes your father had to wash.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, I do love that story; I think it\u2019s simply exquisite!\u201d cried Mme. Swann. \u201cBut certainly on the Doctor\u2019s consultation days you should make a point of being \u2018at home,\u2019 among your flowers and books and all your pretty things,\u201d she urged Mme. Cottard. \u201cStraight out like that! Bang! Right in the face; bang! She made no bones about it, I can tell you! And she\u2019d never said a word to me about it, the little wretch; she\u2019s as cunning as a monkey. You are lucky to be able to control yourself; I do envy people who can hide what is in their minds.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve no need to do that, Mme. Bontemps, I\u2019m not so hard to please,\u201d Mme. Cottard gently expostulated. \u201cFor one thing, I\u2019m not in such a privileged position,\u201d she went on, slightly raising her voice as was her custom, as though she were underlining the point of her remark, whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies, those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband. \u201cAnd besides I\u2019m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the Professor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear, it isn\u2019t what one\u2019s glad to do; it\u2019s what one is able to do! I expect you\u2019re not nervous. Do you know, whenever I see the War Minister\u2019s wife making faces, I start copying her at once. It\u2019s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo be sure, yes,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that she had a twitch; my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position, and it\u2019s only natural, when gentlemen get talking together . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd then, don\u2019t you know, it\u2019s just the same with the Chief of the Registry; he\u2019s a hunchback. Whenever he comes to see me, before he\u2019s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump. My husband says I\u2019ll cost him his place. What if I do! A fig for the Ministry! Yes, a fig for the Ministry! I should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper. I can see I am shocking you; you\u2019re so frightfully proper, but I must say there\u2019s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then. Life would be dreadfully monotonous without it.\u201d And she went on talking about the Ministry all the time, as though it had been Mount Olympus. To change the conversation, Mme. Swann turned to Mme. Cottard: \u201cBut you\u2019re looking very smart to-day. Redfern fecit?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, you know, I always swear by Rauthnitz. Besides, it\u2019s only an old thing I\u2019ve had done up.\u201d \u201cNot really! It\u2019s charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGuess how much. . . . No, change the first figure!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t say so! Why, that\u2019s nothing; it\u2019s given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.\u201d \u201cYou see how history comes to be written,\u201d apostrophised the doctor\u2019s wife. And pointing to a neck-ribbon which had been a present from Mme. Swann: \u201cLook, Odette! Do you recognise this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. \u201cOdette, the Prince d\u2019Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?\u201d \u201cWhy, that I shall be delighted,\u201d Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her \u2018fast\u2019 days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. (He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception, and proves that every \u2018go-between\u2019 is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year, and even this seemed excessive to some of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 indignant at the insult offered to the \u2018Mistress\u2019 who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who \u2018failed\u2019 upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the excuse that they were anxious to meet Bergotte (although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns\u2019, and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really \u2014 in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite expressions, to \u2018attract\u2019 him), the little group had its \u2018die-hards\u2019 also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: \u201cWe go to the Mistress\u2019s very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn\u2019t always so easy. . . . If you must know, M. Swann can\u2019t abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn\u2019t much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don\u2019t you see . . .?\u201d Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the \u2018Mistress\u2019 was in the drawing-room, the Prince d\u2019Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: \u201cCharming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!\u201d Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a converse illusion. Not that the latter\u2019s salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one\u2019s big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of \u2018Society\u2019 as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the \u2018Mistress\u2019 was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, \u201cOh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn\u2019t know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well.\u201d And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin (for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them) those arts to which the \u2018Mistress\u2019 attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non-existent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to \u2018bring people together,\u2019 how to \u2018group,\u2019 to \u2018draw out,\u2019 to \u2018keep in the background,\u2019 to act as a \u2018connecting link.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any case, Mme. Swann\u2019s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own, in an inseparable setting of her guests, amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested, summarised, assembled, packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the \u2018Mistress,\u2019 the hostess turned visitor, muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming, as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawing-room embowered in which Mme. Verdurin was a drawing-room in herself. The more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire, and using the plural, as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time: \u201cOdette,\u201d they murmured, \u201cwe are going to leave you.\u201d They envied Mme. Cottard, whom the \u2018Mistress\u2019 called by her Christian name. \u201cCan I drop you anywhere?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked her, unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. \u201cOh, but this lady has been so very kind as to say, she\u2019ll take me,\u201d replied Mme. Cottard, not wishing to appear to be forgetting, when approached by a more illustrious personage, that she had accepted the offer which Mme. Bont\u00e9mps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman. \u201cI must say that I am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles. It is a regular godsend to me, who have no Automedon.\u201d \u201cEspecially,\u201d broke in the \u2018Mistress,\u2019 who felt that she must say something, since she knew Mme. Bont\u00e9mps slightly and had just invited her to her Wednesdays, \u201cas at Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy\u2019s house you\u2019re not very near home. Oh, good gracious, I shall never get into the way of saying Mme. Swann!\u201d It was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan, among those who were not overendowed with wit, to pretend that they could never grow used to saying \u2018Mme. Swann.\u2019 \u201cI have been so accustomed to saying Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy that I nearly went wrong again!\u201d Only Mme. Verdurin, when she spoke to Odette, was not content with the nearly, but went wrong on purpose. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel afraid, Odette, living out in the wilds like this? I\u2019m sure I shouldn\u2019t feel at all comfortable, coming home after dark. Besides, it\u2019s so damp. It can\u2019t be at all good for your husband\u2019s eczema. You haven\u2019t rats in the house, I hope!\u201d \u201cOh, dear no. What a horrid idea!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing; I was told you had. I\u2019m glad to know it\u2019s not true, because I have a perfect horror of the creatures, and I should never have come to see you again. Goodbye, my dear child, we shall meet again soon; you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you. You don\u2019t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water,\u201d she went on, as she prepared to leave the room, Mme. Swann having risen to escort her. \u201cThey are Japanese flowers; you must arrange them the same way as the Japanese.\u201d \u201cI do not agree with Mme. Verdurin, although she is the Law and the Prophets to me in all things! There\u2019s no one like you, Odette, for finding such lovely chrysanthemums, or chrysanthema rather, for it seems that\u2019s what we ought to call them now,\u201d declared Mme. Cottard as soon as the \u2018Mistress\u2019 had shut the door behind her. \u201cDear Mme. Verdurin is not always very kind about other people\u2019s flowers,\u201d said Odette sweetly. \u201cWhom do you go to, Odette,\u201d asked Mme. Cottard, to forestall any further criticism of the \u2018Mistress.\u2019 \u201cLema\u00eetre? I must confess, the other day in Lema\u00eetre\u2019s window I saw a huge, great pink bush which made me do something quite mad.\u201d But modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush, and she said merely that the Professor, \u201cand you know, he\u2019s not at all a quicktempered man,\u201d had \u2018waved his sword in the air\u2019 and told her that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what money meant.\u201d \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve no regular florist except Debac.\u201d \u201cNor have I,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \u201cbut I confess that I am unfaithful to him now and then with Lachaume.\u201d \u201cOh, you forsake him for Lachaume, do you; I must tell Debac that,\u201d retorted Odette, always anxious to shew her wit, and to lead the conversation in her own house, where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan. \u201cBesides, Lachaume is really becoming too dear; his prices are quite excessive, don\u2019t you know; I find his prices impossible!\u201d she added, laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile Mme. Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins\u2019, delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not\u2019 aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they reverse the original order, assuring their hostess that \u201cmost unfortunately, we had another engagement last week.\u201d So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one extra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. \u201cOh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday. . . . Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can\u2019t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won\u2019t let yourself be tempted?\u201d went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, \u201cYou know, they\u2019re not at all bad, these little horrors. They don\u2019t look nice, but just taste one, I know you\u2019ll like it.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, they look quite delicious,\u201d broke in Mme. Cottard. \u201cIn your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade-mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneux. But I agree that they simply don\u2019t know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they\u2019re past masters. As my husband would say, they\u2019re the ne plus ultra.\u201d \u201cOh, but we just make these in the house. You won\u2019t, really?\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t be able to eat a scrap of dinner,\u201d pleaded Mme. Bontemps, \u201cbut I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you.\u201d \u201cYou will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn\u2019t it just the least little bit exaggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!\u201d \u201cOh no, I am not at all clever,\u201d said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. \u201cI am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing.\u201d And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, having caught the words \u201cI am not at all clever,\u201d thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. \u201cTut, tut, tut, tut!\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps, \u201cNot clever; you!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just what I was saying to myself \u2014\u2018What do I hear?\u2019,\u201d the Prince clutched at this straw, \u201cMy ears must have played me false!\u201d \u201cNo, I assure you,\u201d went on Odette, \u201cI am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant.\u201d And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, \u201cHave you seen our dear Baronet?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYou, ignorant!\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps. \u201cThen I wonder what you\u2019d say of the official world, all those wives of Excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks. . . . Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister\u2019s wife. She stared at me, and said \u2018Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. I hear it\u2019s a perfect scream!\u2019 What do you say to that, eh? You can\u2019t help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;\u201d she turned to me, \u201cwas I not right?\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \u201cpeople can\u2019t help answering a little off the mark when they\u2019re asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, \u201cdo you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I\u2019ve just remembered that we\u2019ve accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You wouldn\u2019t care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don\u2019t know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is,\u201d replied Mme. Cottard, \u201cwhat frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can\u2019t have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you\u2019ve found your tongue, as the \u2018Mistress\u2019 says, the ice will soon be broken. For she\u2019s a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it\u2019s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t you dine with us, too?\u201d said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. \u201cAfter dinner we could all go to the Verdurins\u2019 together, \u2018do a Verdurin\u2019; and even if it means that the \u2018Mistress\u2019 will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we\u2019ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what I should like best.\u201d But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: \u201cWho do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won\u2019t be too big a crowd, I hope!\u201d \u201cI certainly shan\u2019t be there,\u201d said Odette. \u201cWe shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don\u2019t mind waiting till then \u2014\u2014\u201d But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one\u2019s house but duchesses (concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins\u2019, that she was a good creature, extremely sensible and not at all a snob) and telling her stories which made her \u2018die laughing\u2019 because she had not heard them before, although she always \u2018saw the point\u2019 at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. \u201cThen the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?\u201d Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. \u201cOh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; be practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion.\u201d Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, \u201cAnd what is that, pray?\u201d inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, \u201cReading.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s a very restful passion in a husband!\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. \u201cWhen the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!\u201d \u201cWell, that needn\u2019t alarm you much . . . \u201d \u201cBut it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn\u2019t get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mild\u00e9, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming luxury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it\u2019s the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister-in-law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I\u2019ve made the most bare-faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It\u2019s very tempting, but more in a friend\u2019s house than at home. I don\u2019t think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first excitement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you\u2019re not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she\u2019s looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you\u2019re making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she expected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea-things, as who should say \u201cTime, please, gentlemen!\u201d And at last she did say to me: \u201cReally, must you go? Very well; good-bye!\u201d I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross-road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, \u201cmade a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d whom, she added, she had never seen \u2018make so much\u2019 of anyone. (\u201cYou and she must have hooked atoms.\u201d) She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: \u201cThis is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the next invitation.\u201d To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first of January was exceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the unexpressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the excuse of New Year\u2019s Day to write to me, saying: \u201cWhat is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us explain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you.\u201d As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people \u2014 and sometimes peoples \u2014 not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts (though their sum-total be indifference) the intention to express those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte\u2019s mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year\u2019s Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting-point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other\u2019s regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year\u2019s Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte, I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope exhausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case \u2014 and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements \u2014 the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind\u2019s eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill-humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly (not that there would be anything extraordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living), it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps \u2014 if it had not created it \u2014 at any rate contrived to render more acute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only, as the middle of the month of January approached, once my hopes of a letter on New Year\u2019s Day had been disappointed, once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm, it was my old sorrow, that of \u2018before the holidays,\u2019 which began again. What was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that I myself was its architect, unconscious, wilful, merciless and patient. The one thing that mattered, my relations with Gilberte, it was I who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend, not indeed her indifference, but what would come to the same thing in the end, my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte\u2019s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy, with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte, but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now, no longer because I loved her too well but because I should certainly be in love with some other woman whom I should continue to desire, to wait for, through hours of which I should not dare to divert any particle of a second to Gilberte who would be nothing to me then. And no doubt at that very moment in which (since I was determined not to see her again, unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part, neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now) I had already lost Gilberte, and loved her more than ever, and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when, spending all my afternoons in her company, or as many as I chose, I believed that no peril threatened our friendship \u2014 no doubt at that moment the idea that I should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me, for that idea carried me away beyond the range of Gilberte, my love and my sufferings. My love, my sufferings in which through my tears I attempted to discern precisely what Gilberte was, and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would, sooner or later, be some other woman\u2019s portion. So that \u2014 or such, at least, was my way of thinking then \u2014 we are always detached from our fellow-creatures; when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names, but may be born again in the future, may have been born already in the past for another and not for her. And in the time when he is not in love, if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love, he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not, at the moment of speaking, feel, and therefore did not know, knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment. That future in which I should not love Gilberte, which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it, certainly there would still have been time to warn Gilberte that it was gradually taking shape, that its coming was, if not imminent, at least inevitable, if she herself, Gilberte, did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference. How often was I not on the point of writing, or of going to Gilberte to tell her: \u201cTake care. My mind is made up. What I am doing now is my supreme effort. I am seeing you now for the last time. Very soon I shall have ceased to love you.\u201d But to what end? By what authority should I have reproached Gilberte for an indifference which, not that I considered myself guilty on that count, I too manifested towards everything that was not herself? The last time! To me, that appeared as something of immense significance, because I was in love with Gilberte. On her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country, an offer which, like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us, we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect. The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one\u2019s words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self-evident the proofs of its excellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons \u2014 of good or evil intent \u2014 spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill-chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking\u2019s sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet (as we ourselves are), do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the expressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one\u2019s time, not in getting to know what one\u2019s love really is, but in making it possible to meet next day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one\u2019s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: \u201cI had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult.\u201d I said also: \u201cI shall probably not see you again;\u201d I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they expressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, \u201cWhat, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it.\u201d The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother\u2019s house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea-party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little \u2018tour of inspection\u2019 she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new \u2018pieces,\u2019 the recent \u2018acquisitions\u2019 which caught the eye in her drawing-room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For since Mme. Swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word \u2018dowdy\u2019\u2014 which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered \u2018smart\u2019\u2014 all those things had, one after another, followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums, innumerable boxes of sweets from Giroux\u2019s, and the coroneted note-paper (not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces, which, even before she had come to know Swann, a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice). Moreover in the artistic disorder, the studio-like confusion of the rooms, whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the white-enamelled drawing-rooms in which, a little later, you were to find Mme. Swann installed, the Far East recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century; and the cushions which, to make me \u2018comfortable,\u2019 Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not, as of old, with Chinese dragons. In the room in which she was usually to be found, and of which she would say, \u201cYes, I like this room; I use it a great deal. I couldn\u2019t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time; this is where I do my work \u2014\u2014\u201d though she never stated precisely at what she was working. Was it a picture? A book, perhaps, for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to \u2018do something,\u2019 not to be quite useless. She was surrounded by Dresden pieces (having a fancy for that sort of porcelain, which she would name with an English accent, saying in any connexion: \u201cHow pretty that is; it reminds me of Dresden flowers,\u201d), and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flower-pots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate, every now and then, the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which Swann, the most courteous and considerate of masters, looked on without being shocked. Not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them; rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming. Rarely nowadays was it in one of those Japanese wrappers that Odette received her familiars, but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a Watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom, and in which she immersed herself, looked solemn, splashed and sported, with such an air of comfort, of a cool skin and long-drawn breath, that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative, a mere setting for herself, but as necessary, in the same way as her \u2018tub\u2019 or her daily \u2018outing,\u2019 to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene. She used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018having nice things about her,\u2019 and that the burning of the \u2018Gioconda\u2019 would distress her infinitely more than the destruction, by the same element, of \u2018millions\u2019 of the people she knew. Theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends, but made her pass among them as a superior woman, and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the Belgian Minister, so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere \u2014 at the Verdurins\u2019, for instance \u2014 she was reckoned a fool. It was this vivacity of expression that made Mme. Swann prefer men\u2019s society to women\u2019s. But when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan\u2019s standpoint, singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men, a lumpy figure, a bad complexion, inability to spell, hairy legs, foul breath, pencilled eyebrows. But towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient, especially if this woman were now in trouble. She would defend her warmly, saying: \u201cPeople are not fair to her. I assure you, she\u2019s quite a nice woman really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not only the furniture of Odette\u2019s drawing-room, it was Odette herself that Mme. Cottard and all those who had frequented the society of Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy would have found it difficult, if they had not seen her for some little time, to recognise. She seemed to be so much younger. No doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter, was in better condition, seemed at once calmer, more cool, more restful, and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder, and into which her eyes and profile, formerly too prominent, seemed now to have been reabsorbed. But another reason for this change lay in the fact that, having reached the turning-point of life, Odette had at length discovered, or invented, a physiognomy of her own, an unalterable \u2018character,\u2019 a \u2018style of beauty\u2019 and on her incoherent features \u2014 which for so long, exposed to every hazard, every weakness of the flesh, borrowing for a moment, at the slightest fatigue, from the years to come, a sort of flickering shadow of anility, had furnished her, well or ill, according to how she was feeling, how she was looking, with a countenance dishevelled, inconstant, formless and attractive \u2014 had now set this fixed type, as it were an immortal youthfulness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious expression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli\u2019s figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist express her \u2018character\u2019 but in her woman\u2019s eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word \u2018Magnificat.\u2019 But he added, \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Save at these moments of involuntary relaxation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re-entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element. The pads, the preposterous \u2018bustle\u2019 had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood-red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me (before my rupture with her daughter) to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm, the dog-toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non-existent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf \u2014 of that same \u2018Scotch tartan\u2019 to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon\u2019s-breast taffetas which were the latest novelty \u2014 was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one\u2019s being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet-strings which were \u2014 now no longer worn. She need only \u2018hold out\u2019 like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: \u201cMme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn\u2019t she?\u201d As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann\u2019s attire those half-hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the \u2018all aboard,\u2019 or even a distant and vague allusion to the \u2018chase me\u2019 kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility \u2014 perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady\u2019s wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea-parties on the days when her mother was \u2018at home,\u2019 had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann\u2019s \u2018kettledrum,\u2019 I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of gros-grain, or of velvet, or of cr\u00eape-de-Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy-going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black cr\u00eape-de-Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four-leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect \u2014 for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence \u2014 of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a \u2018philippine.\u2019 And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of \u2018slashes,\u2019 in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the \u2018leg of mutton\u2019 sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being \u2018fancy dress\u2019 and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: \u201cI don\u2019t play golf,\u201d she would answer, \u201clike so many of my friends. So I should have no excuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the confusion of her drawing-room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to \u2018tempt\u2019 another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: \u201cI have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to-morrow. As I wasn\u2019t sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn\u2019t come.\u201d I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one\u2019s pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one\u2019s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked-for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill-starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte\u2019s estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription (unless some busy-body were to meddle in my affairs), was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those \u2014 so wretchedly inadequate \u2014 that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm\u2019s length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until next day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that I had made. From the moment in which everything was forgotten, in which I was reconciled to Gilberte, I no longer wished to visit her save as a lover. Every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew. And if Mme. Swann, albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother, should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers, I should find other gifts, more precious and less frequent. My parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things. I thought of a big bowl of old Chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt L\u00e9onie, and of which Mamma prophesied daily that Fran\u00e7oise would come running to her with an \u201cOh, it\u2019s all come to pieces!\u201d and that that would be the end of it. Would it not be wiser, in that case, to part with it, to sell it so as to be able to give Gilberte all the pleasure I could. I felt sure that I could easily get a thousand francs for it. I had it tied up in paper; I had grown so used to it that I had ceased altogether to notice it; parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like. I took it with me as I started for the Swanns\u2019, and, giving the driver their address, told him to go by the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things, who knew my father. Greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl. I took the notes with rapture. Every day, for a whole year, I could smother Gilberte in roses and lilac. When I left the shop and got into my cab again the driver (naturally enough, since the Swanns lived out by the Bois) instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. He had just passed the end of the Rue de Berri when, in the failing light, I thought I saw, close to the Swanns\u2019 house but going in the other direction, going away from it, Gilberte, who was walking slowly, though with a firm step, by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing, but whose face I could not distinguish. I stood up in the cab, meaning to tell the driver to stop; then hesitated. The strolling couple were already some way away, and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the Elysian gloom. A moment later, I had reached Gilberte\u2019s door. I was received by Mme. Swann. \u201cOh! she will be sorry!\u201d was my greeting, \u201cI can\u2019t think why she isn\u2019t in. She came home just now from a lesson, complaining of the heat, and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl.\u201d \u201cI fancy I passed her in the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think it can have been. Anyhow, don\u2019t mention it to her father; he doesn\u2019t approve of her going out at this time of night. Must you go? Good-bye.\u201d I left her, told my driver to go home the same way, but found no trace of the two walking figures. Where had they been? What were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I returned home, desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs, which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that Gilberte whom now I had made up my mind never to see again. No doubt my call at the dealer\u2019s had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future, whenever I saw my friend, she would be pleased with me and grateful. But if I had not called there, if my cabman had not taken the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I should not have seen Gilberte with that young man. Thus a single action may have two contradictory effects, and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one. There had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens. We desire some pleasure, and the material means of obtaining it are lacking. \u201cIt is a mistake,\u201d Labruy\u00e8re tells us, \u201cto be in love without an ample fortune.\u201d There is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure. In my case, however, the material means had been forthcoming, but at the same moment, if not by a logical effect, at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success, my pleasure had been snatched from me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As, for that matter, it seems as though it must always be. As a rule, however, not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible. Usually, we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer. But the pleasure can never be realised. If we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances, nature at once shifts the battle-ground, placing it within ourselves, and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain. And if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change, nature does not, on that account, despair of conquering us, in a manner more gradual, it is true, more subtle, but no less efficacious. It is then, at the last moment, that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us, or rather it is that very possession which nature, with diabolical cleverness, uses to destroy our happiness. After failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action, it is a final incapacity, the mental incapacity for happiness, that nature creates in us. The phenomenon, of happiness either fails to appear, or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains \u2014 but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind\u2019s eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one\u2019s cigarette without fear of an explosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte\u2019s sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to-day, with whom we shall be in love to-morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the next, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During those periods in which our bitterness of spirit, though steadily diminishing, still persists, a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories, some cutting speech, some word in a letter that we have had from her. The various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair; for the present it must suffice to say that, of these two kinds, the former is infinitely the less cruel. That is because our conception of the person, since it dwells always within ourselves, is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her, and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope, at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow. (It must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love, prolong it and prevent our recovery, just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence.) But if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic, it is not so with those special memories, those cutting words, that inimical letter (I received only one that could be so described from Gilberte); you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments, few and scattered as they were, and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole. Because the letter has not \u2014 as the image of the beloved creature has \u2014 been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret; we have read it, devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune. Sorrows of this sort come to us in another way; from without; and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart. The picture of our friend in our mind, which we believe to be old, original, authentic, has in reality been refashioned by her many times over. The cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture, it is of another age, it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past. But inasmuch as this past continues to exist, save in ourselves, who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold, a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled, those memories, those letters carry us back to reality, and cannot but make us feel, by the sudden pang they give us, what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen. Not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same, though that does indeed happen at times. There are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again, and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound. Only in their case as we never loved them, we have never counted the years spent apart from them, and this instance, which would invalidate our whole argument, we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation, just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not \u2018come true.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, after a time, absence may prove efficacious. The desire, the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us. Only, we must allow time. Now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing. For one thing, time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow, for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end. And then, too, the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also, so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal, or to seem worth attaining. This idea, however, that it will be attainable, that what, when it no longer spells any good fortune to us, we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune, this idea embodies a part, but a part only of the truth. Our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it. But the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting, and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when, very probably, it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate. People are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest. The friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love, overtures which strike us, in our indifference to her, as excessive, would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love. Those tender speeches, that invitation or acceptance, we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us, and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed, which we should, as likely as not, simply by our avidity for them, have precluded from ever happening. So that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late, when we are no longer in love, is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us, at one time, so unhappy. There is only one person who could decide that; our ego of those days; he is no longer with us, and were he to reappear, no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune \u2014 whether identical or not \u2014 vanish\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which I should not, when the time came, be greatly interested, by dint of my having to invent, as in the days when I still hardly knew Gilberte, speeches, letters in which she implored my forgiveness, swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her, a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of Gilberte and the young man, which had nothing now to feed upon. At this point I should perhaps have resumed my visits to Mme. Swann but for a dream that came to me, in which one of my friends, who was not, however, one that I could identify, behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me, and finding that it persisted after I was awake, I turned my thoughts back to the dream, racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom I had seen in my sleep, the sound of whose name \u2014 a Spanish name \u2014 was no longer distinct in my ears. Combining Joseph\u2019s part with Pharaoh\u2019s, I set to work to interpret my dream. I knew that, when one is interpreting a dream, it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it, who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces, like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored, fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names. Those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us. The person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer. From mine I learned that, though transformed while I was asleep into a young man, the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was Gilberte. I remembered then that, the last time I had seen her, on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancing-lesson, she had, whether in sincerity or in make-believe, declined, laughing in a strange manner, to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her. And by association this memory brought back to me another. Long before that, it had been Swann who would not believe in my sincerity, nor that I was a suitable friend for Gilberte. In vain had I written to him, Gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh. She had not returned it to me at once: I remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels. As soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral. Gilberte\u2019s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon. Such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street, and avoids obvious dangers. But there are others that take effect within us. The accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking, from inside, from the heart. Gilberte\u2019s words: \u201cIf you like, we might go on wrestling,\u201d made me shudder. I imagined her behaving like that, at home perhaps, in the linen-room, with the young man whom I had seen escorting her along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. And so, just as when, a little time back, I had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness, it had been fatuous in me, now that I had abandoned all thought of happiness, to take for granted that at least I had grown and was going to remain calm. For, so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person, it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed; when that happiness has vanished, when we have suffered, and, later, when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep, the thing then that is as elusive, as precarious as ever our happiness was, is our calm. Mine returned to me in the end, for the cloud which, lowering our resistance, tempering our desires, has penetrated, in the train of a dream, the enclosure of our mind, is bound, in course of time, to dissolve, permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world, not even to grief. Besides, those whose suffering is due to love are, as we say of certain invalids, their own physicians. As consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief, and as their grief is an emanation from that person, it is there, in their grief itself, that they must in the end find a remedy: which it will disclose to them at a given moment, for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved, the regretted creature, at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her, since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer, at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope. But even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm, I no longer wished \u2014 except just occasionally \u2014 to visit Mme. Swann. In the first place because, among those who love and have been forsaken, the state of incessant \u2014 even if unconfessed \u2014 expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation, and, while to all appearance unchanged, substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite. The first were the consequences of \u2014 a reaction from \u2014 the painful incidents which had upset us. The tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear, all the more since we desire at such moments, should no message come to us from her whom we love, to act for ourselves, and are none too confident of the success of a step which, once we have taken it, we may find it impossible to follow up. But presently, without our having noticed any change, this tension, which still endures, is sustained, we discover, no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future. From that moment it is almost pleasant. Besides, the first state, by continuing for some time, has accustomed us to living in expectation. The suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still, but is already lulled to sleep. We are in no haste to arouse it, especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now. The possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess, which is bound to remain, whatever happens, since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions, an irreducible quantity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another, final reason came later on to reinforce this, and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to Mme. Swann. This reason, slow in revealing itself, was not that I had now forgotten Gilberte but that I must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible. No doubt, now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled, my visits to Mme. Swann had become once again, for what sorrow remained in me, the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first. But what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible, namely that with these visits the memory of Gilberte was intimately blended. The distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of Gilberte no longer nourished, thoughts, interests, passions in which Gilberte should have no part. These states of consciousness, to which the person whom we love remains a stranger, then occupy a place which, however small it may be at first, is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul. We must seek to encourage these thoughts, to make them grow, while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles, so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment, wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul, until at last the victory is complete. I decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed, and I was still young enough, still courageous enough to undertake the attempt, to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that, whatever time one may devote to the effort, it will prove successful in the end. The reason I now gave in my letters to Gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding, wholly fictitious, which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself, and as to which I had hoped at first that Gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation. But, as a matter of fact, never, even in the most insignificant relations in life, does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure, untruthful, incriminating sentence has been written on purpose, so that he shall protest against it, and is only too glad to feel, when he reads it, that he possesses \u2014 and to keep in his own hands \u2014 the initiative in the coming operations. For all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations, in which love is endowed with so much eloquence, indifference with so little curiosity. Gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding, it became for me a real entity, to which I referred anew in every letter. And there is in these baseless situations, in the affectation of coldness, a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them. By dint of writing: \u201cNow that our hearts are sundered,\u201d so that Gilberte might answer: \u201cBut they are not. Do explain what you mean,\u201d I had gradually come to believe that they were. By constantly repeating, \u201cLife may have changed for us, it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another,\u201d in the hope of hearing myself, one day, say: \u201cBut there has been no change, the feeling is stronger now than ever it was,\u201d I was living with the idea that life had indeed changed, that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed, as certain neurotics, from having at first pretended to be ill, end by becoming chronic invalids. Now, whenever I had to write to Gilberte, I brought my mind back to this imagined change, which, being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies, would in future subsist between us. Then Gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it. She too adopted my point of view; and, as in the speeches at official banquets, when the foreign Sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the Sovereign who is entertaining him, whenever I wrote to Gilberte: \u201cLife may have parted us; the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure,\u201d she never failed to respond: \u201cLife may have parted us; it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both,\u201d (though we should have found it hard to say why or how \u2018Life\u2019-had parted us, or what change had occurred). My sufferings were no longer excessive. And yet, one day when I was telling her in a letter that I had heard of the death of our old barley-sugar woman in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, as I wrote the words: \u201cI felt at once that this would distress you, in me it awakened a host of memories,\u201d I could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when I saw that I was speaking in the past tense, as though it were of some dead friend, now almost forgotten, of this love of which in spite of myself I had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive, or one that at least might be born again. Nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more. Gilberte\u2019s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which I used to write to people who did not matter, and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection, which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When spring drew round, and with it the cold weather, during an icy Lent and the hailstorms of Holy Week, as Mme. Swann began to find it cold in the house, I used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs, her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape, both of ermine, which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive, and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter, more persistent than the rest, which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting. And the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawing-room, which soon I should be entering no more, by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness, that for example of the guelder-roses clustering, at the summits of their tall bare stalks, like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings, their balls of blossom, divided yet composite, white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons. For the mistress of Tansonville knew that April, even an ice-bound April, was not barren of flowers, that winter, spring, summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the town-dweller who, until the first hot day, imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain. That Mme. Swann was content with the consignments furnished by her Combray gardener, that she did not, by the intervention of her own \u2018special\u2019 florist, fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious Mediterranean shore, I do not for a moment suggest, nor did it worry me at the time. It was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that, overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which Mme. Swann kept her hands, the guelder-rose snow-balls (which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose, on the advice of Bergotte, a \u2018Symphony in White\u2019 with her furniture and her garments) reminded me that what the Good Friday music in Parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year, if one had the sense to look for it, and, assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom, which, although their names were unknown to me, had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round Combray, made Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room as virginal, as candidly \u2018in bloom,\u2019 without the least vestige of greenery, as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by Tansonville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile \u2014 a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the \u2018swells\u2019 whom they knew only by name, was known as the \u2018Shabby-Genteel Club\u2019\u2014 I persuaded my parents, on Sundays (for on weekdays I was busy all morning), to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side-street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, luxuriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes \u2014 even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them \u2014 were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet \u2018put up\u2019 when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had (as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children\u2019s education) a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe\u2019 the passers-by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one\u2019s own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique, I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby-ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory (and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own) in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed \u2014 in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say (in English) \u2018Good morning,\u2019 and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What enhanced this impression that Mme. Swann was walking in the Avenue as though along the paths of her own garden, was \u2014 for people ignorant of her habit of \u2018taking exercise\u2019\u2014 that she had come there on foot, without any carriage following, she whom, once May had begun, they were accustomed to see, behind the most brilliant \u2018turn-out,\u2019 the smartest liveries in Paris, gently and majestically seated, like a goddess, in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs. On foot Mme. Swann had the appearance \u2014 especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun \u2014 of having yielded to curiosity, of committing an \u2018exclusive\u2019 breach of all the rules of her code, like those Crowned Heads who, without consulting anyone, accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism, step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre, mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience. So between Mme. Swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are. The Faubourg Saint-Germain may have its barriers also, but these are less \u2018telling\u2019 to the eyes and imagination of the \u2018shabby-genteel.\u2019 These latter, when in the presence of a real personage, more simple, more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man, less remote from the people, will not feel the same sense of their own inequality, almost of their unworthiness, as dismays them when they encounter Mme. Swann. Of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled, as the crowd are, by the brilliance of their apparel, they have ceased to pay any attention to it, but only because they have grown used to it, that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary, to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways: so that (the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material, easily verified, slowly acquired, the lack of it hard to compensate) if such women place a passer-by in the lowest rank of society, it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest, that is to say instinctively, at first sight, and without possibility of appeal. Perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like Lady Israels, who mixed with the women of the aristocracy, and Mme. Swann, who was to get to know them later on, that intermediate class, inferior to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, since it \u2018ran after\u2019 the denizens of that quarter, but superior to everything that was not of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, possessing this peculiarity that, while already detached from the world of the merely rich, it was riches still that it represented, but riches that had been canalised, serving a purpose, swayed by an idea that was artistic, malleable gold, chased with a poetic design, taught to smile; perhaps that class \u2014 in the same form, at least, and with the same charm \u2014 exists no longer. In any event, the women who were its members would not satisfy to-day what was the primary condition on which they reigned, since with advancing age they have lost \u2014 almost all of them \u2014 their beauty. Whereas it was (just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune) from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that Mme. Swann, majestic, smiling, kind, as she advanced along the Avenue du Bois, saw like Hypatia, beneath the slow tread of her feet, worlds revolving. Various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously, not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her (especially since, having been introduced only once, at the most, to Swann, they were afraid that he might not remember them) was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats. And they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds, asking themselves whether the gesture, so bold, so sacrilegious a tempting of providence, would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down, upon them the vengeance of a jealous god. It provoked only, like the winding of a piece of clockwork, a series of gesticulations from little, responsive bowing figures, who were none other than Odette\u2019s escort, beginning with Swann himself, who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy, which he had acquired in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn. Its place was now taken (as though he had been to some extent permeated by Odette\u2019s prejudices) at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife\u2019s knowing so many people, a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side: \u201cWhatl another! Upon my word, I can\u2019t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up!\u201d Meanwhile, having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth, who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously, Mme. Swann turned to me: \u201cThen it\u2019s all over?\u201d she put it to me, \u201cYou aren\u2019t ever coming to see Gilberte again? I\u2019m glad you make an exception of me, and are not going to \u2018drop\u2019 me straight away. I like seeing you, but I used to like also the influence you had over my daughter. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s very sorry about it, too. However, I mustn\u2019t bully you, or you\u2019ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again.\u201d \u201cOdette, Sagan\u2019s trying to speak to you!\u201d Swann called his wife\u2019s attention. And there, indeed, was the Prince, as in some transformation scene at the close of a play, or in a circus, or an old painting, wheeling his horse round so as to face her, in a magnificent heroic pose, and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and, so to speak, allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for Woman, were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know. And at every moment, recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her, Mme. Swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen, who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the Avenue, men from the clubs, the names of whom, which meant only celebrities to the public, Antoine de Castellane, Adalbert de Montmorency and the rest \u2014 were for Mme. Swann the familiar names of friends. And as the average span of life, the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered, long after the sorrows that I once felt on Gilberte\u2019s account have faded and vanished, there has survived them the pleasure that I still derive \u2014 whenever I close my eyes and read, as it were upon the face of a sundial, the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o\u2019clock in the month of May \u2014 from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with Mme. Swann beneath her parasol, as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower", "http://genius.com/Marcel-proust-madame-swann-at-home-chapter-1-lyrics"], "494955": ["Long Gone by\u00a0Louis\u00a0Armstrong", "Long Gone Lyrics\n\nPops, did you hear the story of long John Dean?\nNot yet drummer\nA bold bank robber from Bowlin' Green\nWas sent to the jail house yesterday\nBut late last night he made his getaway\n\nHe was long gone from Kentucky\nLong gone, ain't he lucky?\nLong gone, what I mean\nA long gone John from Bowlin' Green\n\nLong John stood on the railroad tie\nWaitin' for freight train to come by\nFreight train came by puffin' and flyin'\nOughta seen long John grabbin' that blind\n\nHe was long gone from Kentucky\nLong gone, ain't he lucky?\nLong gone, what I mean\nLong gone John from Bowlin' Green\n\nThey caught him in Frisco to seal his fate\nAt San Quentin they jailed him one evening late\nBut out on the ocean, John did escape\nCause the guards forgot to close the Golden Gate\n\nHe was long gone from Kentucky\nLong gone, ain't he lucky?\nLong gone, what I mean\nA long gone John from Bowlin' Green\n\nWhile they offered a reward to bring him back\nEven put bloodhounds on his track\nThose doggone bloodhounds lost his scent\nNow nobody knows where John went\n\nHe was long gone from Kentucky\nLong gone, ain't he lucky?\nLong gone, what I mean\nA long gone John from Bowlin' Green\n\nA gang of men tried to capture Dean\nSo they chased him with a submarine\nDean jumped overboard and grabbed the submarine\nAnd made that gang catch a flyin' machine\n\nHe's long gone from Kentucky\nA long gone, that boy's lucky?\nA long gone, what I mean\nA long gone John from Bowlin' Green\n\nHe's long gone, I said from Kentucky\nLong gone, hmm that boy's lucky\nLong gone, yeah he's got nothing in the head\nLong gone, long gone", "http://genius.com/Louis-armstrong-long-gone-lyrics"], "1291628": ["Allegro Furioso by\u00a0Mekong\u00a0Delta", "Allegro Furioso Lyrics\n\n[taken from \"Five Fragments for Group & Orchestra\"]", "http://genius.com/Mekong-delta-allegro-furioso-lyrics"], "344173": ["1965 Playboy Interview Part 1 by\u00a0Alex\u00a0Haley (Ft.\u00a0J.R. & Martin\u00a0Luther King Jr)", "1965 Playboy Interview Part 1 Lyrics\n\nOn December 5, 1955, to the amused annoyance of the white citizens of Montgomery, Alabama, an obscure young Baptist minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., called a city-wide Negro boycott of its segregated bus system. To their consternation, however, it was almost 100 percent successful; it lasted for 381 days and nearly bankrupted the bus line. When King's home was bombed during the siege, thousands of enraged Negroes were ready to riot, but the soft-spoken clergyman prevailed on them to channel their anger into nonviolent protest\u2014and became world-renowned as a champion of Gandhi's philosophy of passive resistance. Within a year the Supreme Court had ruled Jim Crow seating unlawful on Montgomery's buses, and King found himself, at 27, on the front lines of a nonviolent Negro revolution against racial injustice.\n\nMoving to Atlanta, he formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an alliance of church-affiliated civil rights organizations which joined such activist groups as CORE and SNCC in a widening campaign of sit-in demonstrations and freedom rides throughout the South. Dissatisfied with the slow pace of the protest movement, King decided to create a crisis in 1963 that would \"dramatize the Negro plight and galvanize the national conscience.\" He was abundantly successful, for his mass nonviolent demonstration in arch-segregationist Birmingham resulted in the arrest of more than 3300 Negroes, including King himself; and millions were outraged by front-page pictures of Negro demonstrators being brutalized by the billy sticks, police dogs and fire hoses of police chief Bull Connor.\n\nIn the months that followed, mass sit-ins and demonstrations erupted in 800 Southern cities; President Kennedy proposed a Civil Rights Bill aimed at the enforcement of voting rights, equal employment opportunities, and the desegregation of public facilities, and the now-famous march on Washington, 200,000 strong, was eloquently addressed by King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. By the end of that \"long hot summer,\" America's Negroes had won more tangible gains than in any year since 1865\u2014and Martin Luther King had become their acknowledged leader and most respected spokesman.\n\nHe earned it the hard way: In the course of his civil rights work he has been jailed 14 times and stabbed once in the chest; his home has been bombed three times; and his daily mail brings a steady flow of death threats and obscenities. Undeterred, he works 20 hours a day, travels 325,000 miles and makes 450 speeches a year throughout the country on behalf of the Negro cause. Inundated by calls, callers and correspondence at his S.C.L.C. office in Atlanta, he also finds time somehow to preach, visit the sick and help the poor among his congregation at the city's Ebenezer Baptist Church, of which he and his father are the pastors.\n\nSo heavy, in fact, were his commitments when we called him last summer for an interview, that two months elapsed before he was able to accept our request for an appointment. We kept it\u2014only to spend a week in Atlanta waiting vainly for him to find a moment for more than an apology and a hurried handshake. A bit less pressed when we returned for a second visit, King was finally able to sandwich in a series of hour and half-hour conversations with us among the other demands of a grueling week. The resultant interview is the longest he has ever granted to any publication.\n\nThough he spoke with heartfelt and often eloquent sincerity, his tone was one of businesslike detachment. And his mood, except for one or two flickering smiles of irony, was gravely serious\u2014never more so than the moment, during a rare evening with his family on our first night in town, when his four children chided him affectionately for \"not being home enough.\" After dinner, we began the interview on this personal note.\n\n\nPlayboy: Dr. King, are your children old enough to be aware of the issues at stake in the civil rights movement, and of your role in it?\n\nKing: Yes, they are\u2014especially my oldest child, Yolanda. Two years ago, I remember, I returned home after serving one of my terms in the Albany, Georgia, jail, and she asked me, \"Daddy, why do you have to go to jail so much?\" I told her that I was involved in a struggle to make conditions better for the colored people, and thus for all people. I explained that because things are as they are, someone has to take a stand, that it is necessary for someone to go to jail, because many Southern officials seek to maintain the barriers that have historically been erected to exclude the colored people. I tried to make her understand that someone had to do this to make the world better\u2014for all children. She was only six at that time, but she was already aware of segregation because of an experience that we had had.\n\nPlayboy: Would you mind telling us about it?\n\nKing: Not at all. The family often used to ride with me to the Atlanta airport, and on our way, we always passed Funtown, a sort of miniature Disneyland with mechanical rides and that sort of thing. Yolanda would inevitably say, \"I want to go to Funtown,\" and I would always evade a direct reply. I really didn't know how to explain to her why she couldn't go. Then one day at home, she ran downstairs exclaiming that a TV commercial was urging people to come to Funtown. Then my wife and I had to sit down with her between us and try to explain it. I have won some applause as a speaker, but my tongue twisted and my speech stammered seeking to explain to my six-year-old daughter why the public invitation on television didn't include her, and others like her. One of the most painful experiences I have ever faced was to see her tears when I told her that Funtown was closed to colored children, for I realized that at that moment the first dark cloud of inferiority had floated into her little mental sky, that at that moment her personality had begun to warp with that first unconscious bitterness toward white people. It was the first time that prejudice based upon skin color had been explained to her. But it was of paramount importance to me that she not grow up bitter. So I told her that although many white people were against her going to Funtown, there were many others who did want colored children to go. It helped somewhat. Pleasantly, word came to me later that Funtown had quietly desegregated, so I took Yolanda. A number of white persons there asked, \"Aren't you Dr. King, and isn't this your daughter?\" I said we were, and she heard them say how glad they were to see us there.\n\nPlayboy: As one who grew up in the economically comfortable, socially insulated environment of a middle-income home in Atlanta, can you recall when it was that you yourself first became painfully and personally aware of racial prejudice?\n\nKing: Very clearly. When I was 14, I had traveled from Atlanta to Dublin, Georgia, with a dear teacher of mine, Mrs. Bradley; she's dead now. I had participated there in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks. It turned out to be a memorable day, for I had succeeded in winning the contest. My subject, I recall, ironically enough, was \"The Negro and the Constitution.\" Anyway, that night, Mrs. Bradley and I were on a bus returning to Atlanta, and at a small town along the way, some white passengers boarded the bus, and the white driver ordered us to get up and give the whites our seats. We didn't move quickly enough to suit him, so he began cursing us, calling us \"black sons of bitches.\" I intended to stay right in that seat, but Mrs. Bradley finally urged me up, saying we had to obey the law. And so we stood up in the aisle for the 90 miles to Atlanta. That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\n\nPlayboy: Wasn't it another such incident on a bus, years later, that thrust you into your present role as a civil rights leader?\n\nKing: Yes, it was\u2014in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. E.D. Nixon, a Pullman porter long identified with the NAACP, telephoned me late one night to tell me that Mrs. Rosa Parks had been arrested around seven-thirty that evening when a bus driver demanded that she give up her seat, and she refused\u2014because her feet hurt. Nixon had already bonded Mrs. Parks out of prison. He said, \"It's time this stops; we ought to boycott the buses.\" I agreed and said, \"Now.\" The next night we called a meeting of Negro community leaders to discuss it, and on Saturday and Sunday we appealed to the Negro community, with leaflets and from the pulpits, to boycott the buses on Monday. We had in mind a one-day boycott, and we were banking on 60-percent success. But the boycott saw instantaneous 99-percent success. We were so pleasantly surprised and impressed that we continued, and for the next 381 days the boycott of Montgomery's buses by Negroes was 99 9/10 successful.\n\nPlayboy: Were you sure you'd win?\n\nKing: There was one dark moment when we doubted it. We had been struggling to make the boycott a success when the city of Montgomery successfully obtained an injunction from the court to stop our car pool. I didn't know what to say to our people. They had backed us up, and we had let them down. It was a desolate moment. I saw, all of us saw, that the court was leaning against us. I remember telling a group of those working closest with me to spread in the Negro community the message, \"We must have the faith that things will work out somehow, that God will make a way for us when there seems no way.\" It was about noontime, I remember, when Rex Thomas of the Associated Press rushed over to where I was sitting and told me of the news flash that the U.S. Supreme Court had declared that bus segregation in Montgomery was unconstitutional. It had literally been the darkest hour before the dawn.\n\nPlayboy: You and your followers were criticized, after your arrest for participating in the boycott, for accepting bail and leaving jail. Do you feel, in retrospect, that you did the right thing?\n\nKing: No; I think it was a mistake, a tactical error for me to have left jail, by accepting bail, after being indicted along with 125 others, mainly drivers of our car pool, under an old law of doubtful constitutionality, an \"antiboycott\" ordinance. I should have stayed in prison. It would have nationally dramatized and deepened our movement even earlier, and it would have more quickly aroused and keened America's conscience.\n\nPlayboy: Do you feel you've been guilty of any comparable errors in judgment since then?\n\nKing: Yes, I do\u2014in Albany, Georgia, in 1962. If I had that to do again, I would guide that community's Negro leadership differently than I did. The mistake I made there was to protest against segregation generally rather than against a single and distinct facet of it. Our protest was so vague that we got nothing, and the people were left very depressed and in despair. It would have been much better to have concentrated upon integrating the buses or the lunch counters. One victory of this kind would have been symbolic, would have galvanized support and boosted morale. But I don't mean that our work in Albany ended in failure. The Negro people there straightened up their bent backs; you can't ride a man's back unless it's bent. Also, thousands of Negroes registered to vote who never had voted before, and because of the expanded Negro vote in the next election for governor of Georgia\u2014which pitted a moderate candidate against a rabid segregationist\u2014Georgia elected its first governor who had pledged to respect and enforce the law impartially. And what we learned from our mistakes in Albany helped our later campaigns in other cities to be more effective. We have never since scattered our efforts in a general attack on segregation, but have focused upon specific, symbolic objectives.\n\nPlayboy: Can you recall any other mistakes you've made in leading the movement?\n\nKing: Well, the most pervasive mistake I have made was in believing that because our cause was just, we could be sure that the white ministers of the South, once their Christian consciences were challenged, would rise to our aid. I felt that white ministers would take our cause to the white power structures. I ended up, of course, chastened and disillusioned. As our movement unfolded, and direct appeals were made to white ministers, most folded their hands\u2014and some even took stands against us.\n\nPlayboy: Their stated reason for refusing to help was that it was not the proper role of the church to \"intervene in secular affairs.\" Do you disagree with this view?\n\nKing: Most emphatically. The essence of the Epistles of Paul is that Christians should rejoice at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believe. The projection of a social gospel, in my opinion, is the true witness of a Christian life. This is the meaning of the true ekklesia\u2014the inner, spiritual church. The church once changed society. It was then a thermostat of society. But today I feel that too much of the church is merely a thermometer, which measures rather than molds popular opinion.\n\nPlayboy: Are you speaking of the church in general\u2014or the white church in particular?\n\nKing: The white church, I'm sorry to say. Its leadership has greatly disappointed me. Let me hasten to say there are some outstanding exceptions. As one whose Christian roots go back through three generations of ministers\u2014my father, grandfather and great-grandfather\u2014I will remain true to the church as long as I live. But the laxity of the white church collectively has caused me to weep tears of love. There cannot be deep disappointment without deep love. Time and again in my travels, as I have seen the outward beauty of white churches, I have had to ask myself, \"What kind of people worship there? Who is their God? Is their God the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and is their Savior the Savior who hung on the cross at Golgotha? Where were their voices when a black race took upon itself the cross of protest against man's injustice to man? Where were their voices when defiance and hatred were called for by white men who sat in these very churches?\"\n\nAs the Negro struggles against grave injustice, most white churchmen offer pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. As you say, they claim that the gospel of Christ should have no concern with social issues. Yet white churchgoers, who insist that they are Christians, practice segregation as rigidly in the house of God as they do in movie-houses. Too much of the white church is timid and ineffectual, and some of it is shrill in its defense of bigotry and prejudice. In most communities, the spirit of status quo is endorsed by the churches.\n\nMy personal disillusionment with the church began when I was thrust into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery. I was confident that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would prove strong allies in our just cause. But some became open adversaries, some cautiously shrank from the issue, and others hid behind silence. My optimism about help from the white church was shattered; and on too many occasions since, my hopes for the white church have been dashed. There are many signs that the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. Unless the early sacrificial spirit is recaptured, I am very much afraid that today's Christian church will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and we will see the Christian church dismissed as a social club with no meaning or effectiveness for our time, as a form without substance, as salt without savor. The real tragedy, though, is not Martin Luther King's disillusionment with the church\u2014for I am sustained by its spiritual blessings as a minister of the gospel with a lifelong commitment; the tragedy is that in my travels. I meet young people of all races whose disenchantment with the church has soured into outright disgust.\n\nPlayboy: Do you feel that the Negro church has come any closer to \"the projection of a social gospel\" in its commitment to the cause?\n\nKing: I must say that when my Southern Christian Leadership Conference began its work in Birmingham, we encountered numerous Negro church reactions that had to be overcome. Negro ministers were among other Negro leaders who felt they were being pulled into something that they had not helped to organize. This is almost always a problem. Negro community unity was the first requisite if our goals were to be realized. I talked with many groups, including one group of 200 ministers, my theme to them being that a minister cannot preach the glories of heaven while ignoring social conditions in his own community that cause men an earthly hell. I stressed that the Negro minister had particular freedom and independence to provide strong, firm leadership, and I asked how the Negro would ever gain freedom without his minister's guidance, support and inspiration. These ministers finally decided to entrust our movement with their support, and as a result, the role of the Negro church today, by and large, is a glorious example in the history of Christendom. For never in Christian history, within a Christian country, have Christian churches been on the receiving end of such naked brutality and violence as we are witnessing here in America today. Not since the days of the Christians in the catacombs has God's house, as a symbol, weathered such attack as the Negro churches.\n\nI shall never forget the grief and bitterness I felt on that terrible September morning when a bomb blew out the lives of those four little, innocent girls sitting in their Sunday-school class in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. I think of how a woman cried out, crunching through broken glass, \"My God, we're not even safe in church!\" I think of how that explosion blew the face of Jesus Christ from a stained-glass window. It was symbolic of how sin and evil had blotted out the life of Christ. I can remember thinking that if men were this bestial, was it all worth it? Was there any hope? Was there any way out?\n\nPlayboy: Do you still feel this way?\n\nKing: No, time has healed the wounds\u2014and buoyed me with the inspiration of another moment which I shall never forget: when I saw with my own eyes over 3000 young Negro boys and girls, totally unarmed, leave Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church to march to a prayer meeting\u2014ready to pit nothing but the power of their bodies and souls against Bull Connor's police dogs, clubs and fire hoses. When they refused Connor's bellowed order to turn back, he whirled and shouted to his men to turn on the hoses. It was one of the most fantastic events of the Birmingham story that these Negroes, many of them on their knees, stared, unafraid and unmoving, at Connor's men with the hose nozzles in their hands. Then, slowly the Negroes stood up and advanced, and Connor's men fell back as though hypnotized, as the Negroes marched on past to hold their prayer meeting. I saw there, I felt there, for the first time, the pride and the power of nonviolence.\n\nAnother time I will never forget was one Saturday night, late, when my brother telephoned me in Atlanta from Birmingham\u2014that city which some call \"Bombingham\"\u2014which I had just left. He told me that a bomb had wrecked his home, and that another bomb, positioned to exert its maximum force upon the motel room in which I had been staying, had injured several people. My brother described the terror in the streets as Negroes, furious at the bombings, fought whites. Then, behind his voice, I heard a rising chorus of beautiful singing: \"We shall overcome.\" Tears came into my eyes that at such a tragic moment, my race still could sing its hope and faith.\n\nPlayboy: We Shall Overcome has become the unofficial song and slogan of the civil rights movement. Do you consider such inspirational anthems important to morale?\n\nKing: In a sense, songs are the soul of a movement. Consider, in World War Two, Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition, and in World War One, Over There and Tipperary, and during the Civil War, Battle Hymn of the Republic and John Brown's Body. A Negro song anthology would include sorrow songs, shouts for joy, battle hymns, anthems. Since slavery, the Negro has sung throughout his struggle in America. Steal Away and Go Down, Moses were the songs of faith and inspiration which were sung on the plantations. For the same reasons the slaves sang, Negroes today sing freedom songs, for we, too, are in bondage. We sing out our determination that \"We shall overcome, black and white together, we shall overcome someday.\" I should also mention a song parody that I enjoyed very much which the Negroes sang during our campaign in Albany, Georgia. It goes: \"I'm comin', I'm comin'/And my head ain't bendin' low/I'm walkin' tall, I'm talkin' strong/I'm America's New Black Joe.\"\n\nPlayboy: Your detractors in the Negro community often refer to you snidely as \"De Lawd\" and \"Booker T. King.\" What's your reaction to this sort of Uncle Tom label?\n\nKing: I hear some of those names, but my reaction to them is never emotional. I don't think you can be in public life without being called bad names. As Lincoln said, \"If I answered all criticism, I'd have time for nothing else.\" But with regard to both of the names you mentioned, I've always tried to be what I call militantly nonviolent. I don't believe that anyone could seriously accuse me of not being totally committed to the breakdown of segregation.\n\nPlayboy: What do you mean by \"militantly nonviolent\"?\n\nKing: I mean to say that a strong man must be militant as well as moderate. He must be a realist as well as an idealist. If I am to merit the trust invested in me by some of my race, I must be both of these things. This is why nonviolence is a powerful as well as a just weapon. If you confront a man who has long been cruelly misusing you, and say, \"Punish me, if you will; I do not deserve it, but I will accept it, so that the world will know I am right and you are wrong,\" then you wield a powerful and a just weapon. This man, your oppressor, is automatically morally defeated, and if he has any conscience, he is ashamed. Wherever this weapon is used in a manner that stirs a community's, or a nation's, anguished conscience, then the pressure of public opinion becomes an ally in your just cause.\n\nAnother of the major strengths of the nonviolent weapon is its strange power to transform and transmute the individuals who subordinate themselves to its disciplines, investing them with a cause that is larger than themselves. They become, for the first time, somebody, and they have, for the first time, the courage to be free. When the Negro finds the courage to be free, he faces dogs and guns and clubs and fire hoses totally unafraid, and the white men with those dogs, guns, clubs and fire hoses see that the Negro they have traditionally called \"boy\" has become a man.\n\nWe should not forget that, although nonviolent direct action did not originate in America, it found a natural home where it has been a revered tradition to rebel against injustice. This great weapon, which we first tried out in Montgomery during the bus boycott, has been further developed throughout the South over the past decade, until by today it has become instrumental in the greatest mass-action crusade for freedom that has occurred in America since the Revolutionary War. The effectiveness of this weapon's ability to dramatize, in the world's eyes, an oppressed peoples' struggle for justice is evident in the fact that of 1963's top ten news stories after the assassination of President Kennedy and the events immediately connected with it, nine stories dealt with one aspect or another of the Negro struggle.\n\nPlayboy: Several of those stories dealt with your own nonviolent campaigns against segregation in various Southern cities, where you and your followers have been branded \"rabble-rousers\" and \"outside agitators.\" Do you feel you've earned these labels?\n\nKing: Wherever the early Christians appeared, spreading Christ's doctrine of love, the resident power structure accused them of being \"disturbers of the peace\" and \"outside agitators.\" But the small Christian band continued to teach and exemplify love, convinced that they were \"a colony of heaven\" on this earth who were missioned to obey not man but God. If those of us who employ nonviolent direct action today are dismissed by our white brothers as \"rabble-rousers\" and \"outside agitators,\" if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts and goals, we can be assured that the summer of 1965 will be no less long and hot than the summer of 1964.\n\nOur white brothers must be made to understand that nonviolence is a weapon fabricated of love. It is a sword that heals. Our nonviolent direct-action program has as its objective not the creation of tensions, but the surfacing of tensions already present. We set out to precipitate a crisis situation that must open the door to negotiation. I am not afraid of the words \"crisis\" and \"tension.\" I deeply oppose violence, but constructive crisis and tension are necessary for growth. Innate in all life, and all growth, is tension. Only in death is there an absence of tension. To cure injustices, you must expose them before the light of human conscience and the bar of public opinion, regardless of whatever tensions that exposure generates. Injustices to the Negro must be brought out into the open where they cannot be evaded.\n\nPlayboy: Is this the sole aim of your Southern Christian Leadership Conference?\n\nKing: We have five aims: first, to stimulate nonviolent, direct, mass action to expose and remove the barriers of segregation and discrimination; second, to disseminate the creative philosophy and techniques of nonviolence through local and area workshops; third, to secure the right and unhampered use of the ballot for every citizen; fourth, to achieve full citizenship rights, and the total integration of the Negro into American life; and fifth, to reduce the cultural lag through our citizenship training program.\n\nPlayboy: How does S.C.L.C. select the cities where nonviolent campaigns and demonstrations are to be staged?\n\nKing: The operational area of S.C.L.C. is the entire South, where we have affiliated organizations in some 85 cities. Our major campaigns have been conducted only in cities where a request for our help comes from one of these affiliate organizations, and only when we feel that intolerable conditions in that community might be ameliorated with our help. I will give you an example. In Birmingham, one of our affiliate organizations is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, which was organized by the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, a most energetic and indomitable man. It was he who set out to end Birmingham's racism, challenging the terrorist reign of Bull Connor. S.C.L.C. watched admiringly as the small Shuttlesworth-led organization fought in the Birmingham courts and with boycotts. Shuttlesworth was jailed several times, his home and church were bombed, and still he did not back down. His defiance of Birmingham's racism inspired and encouraged Negroes throughout the South. Then, at a May 1962 board meeting of the S.C.L.C. in Chattanooga, the first discussions began that later led to our joining Shuttlesworth's organization in a massive direct-action campaign to attack Birmingham's segregation.\n\nPlayboy: One of the highlights of that campaign was your celebrated \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\"\u2014written during one of your jail terms for civil disobedience\u2014an eloquent reply to eight Protestant, Catholic and Jewish clergymen who had criticized your activities in Birmingham. Do you feel that subsequent events have justified the sentiments expressed in your letter?\n\nKing: I would say yes. Two or three important and constructive things have happened which can be at least partially attributed to that letter. By now, nearly a million copies of the letter have been widely circulated in churches of most of the major denominations. It helped to focus greater international attention upon what was happening in Birmingham. And I am sure that without Birmingham, the march on Washington wouldn't have been called\u2014which in my mind was one of the most creative steps the Negro struggle has taken. The march on Washington spurred and galvanized the consciences of millions. It gave the American Negro a new national and international stature. The press of the world recorded the story as nearly a quarter of a million Americans, white and black, assembled in grandeur as a testimonial to the Negro's determination to achieve freedom in this generation.\n\nIt was also the image of Birmingham which, to a great extent, helped to bring the Civil Rights Bill into being in 1963. Previously, President Kennedy had decided not to propose it that year, feeling that it would so arouse the South that it would meet a bottleneck. But Birmingham, and subsequent developments, caused him to reorder his legislative priorities.\n\nOne of these decisive developments was our last major campaign before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act\u2014in St. Augustine, Florida. We received a plea for help from Dr. Robert Hayling, the leader of the St. Augustine movement. St. Augustine, America's oldest city, and one of the most segregated cities in America, was a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society. Such things had happened as Klansmen abducting four Negroes and beating them unconscious with clubs, brass knuckles, ax handles and pistol butts. Dr. Hayling's home had been shot up with buckshot, three Negro homes had been bombed and several Negro night clubs shotgunned. A Negro's car had been destroyed by fire because his child was one of the six Negro children permitted to attend white schools. And the homes of two of the Negro children in the white schools had been burned down. Many Negroes had been fired from jobs that some had worked on for 28 years because they were somehow connected with the demonstrations. Police had beaten and arrested Negroes for picketing, marching and singing freedom songs. Many Negroes had served up to 90 days in jail for demonstrating against segregation, and four teenagers had spent six months in jail for picketing. Then, on February seventh of last year, Dr. Hayling's home was shotgunned a second time, with his pregnant wife and two children barely escaping death; the family dog was killed while standing behind the living-room door. So S.C.L.C. decided to join in last year's celebration of St. Augustine's gala 400th birthday as America's oldest city\u2014by converting it into a nonviolent battleground. This is just what we did.\n\nPlayboy: But isn't it true, Dr. King, that during this and other \"nonviolent\" demonstrations, violence has occurred\u2014sometimes resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides?\n\nKing: Yes, in part that is true. But what is always overlooked is how few people, in ratio to the numbers involved, have been casualties. An army on maneuvers, against no enemy, suffers casualties, even fatalities. A minimum of whites have been casualties in demonstrations solely because our teaching of nonviolence disciplines our followers not to fight even if attacked. A minimum of Negroes are casualties for two reasons: Their white oppressors know that the world watches their actions, and for the first time they are being faced by Negroes who display no fear.\n\nPlayboy: It was shortly after your St. Augustine campaign last summer, as you mentioned, that the Civil Rights Bill was passed\u2014outlawing many of the injustices against which you had been demonstrating. Throughout the South, predictably, it was promptly anathematized as unconstitutional and excessive in its concessions to Negro demands. How do you feel about it?\n\nKing: I don't feel that the Civil Rights Act has gone far enough in some of its coverage. In the first place, it needs a stronger voting section. You will never have a true democracy until you can eliminate all restrictions. We need to do away with restrictive literacy tests. I've seen too much of native intelligence to accept the validity of these tests as a criterion for voting qualifications. Our nation needs a universal method of voter registration\u2014one man, one vote, literally. Second, there is a pressing, urgent need to give the attorney general the right to initiate Federal suits in any area of civil rights denial. Third, we need a strong and strongly enforced fair-housing section such as many states already have. President Kennedy initiated the present housing law, but it is not broad enough. Fourth, we need an extension of FEPC to grapple more effectively with the problems of poverty. Not only are millions of Negroes caught in the clutches of poverty, but millions of poor whites as well. And fifth, conclusive and effective measures must be taken immediately at the Federal level to curb the worsening reign of terror in the South\u2014which is aided and abetted, as everyone knows, by state and local law-enforcement agencies. It's getting so that anybody can kill a Negro and get away with it in the South, as long as they go through the motions of a jury trial. There is very little chance of conviction from lily-white Southern jurors. It must be fixed so that in the case of interracial murder, the Federal Government can prosecute.\n\nPlayboy: Your dissatisfaction with the Civil Rights Act reflects that of most other Negro spokesmen. According to recent polls, however, many whites resent this attitude, calling the Negro \"ungrateful\" and \"unrealistic\" to press his demands for more.\n\nKing: This is a litany to those of us in this field. \"What more will the Negro want?\" \"What will it take to make these demonstrations end?\" Well, I would like to reply with another rhetorical question: Why do white people seem to find it so difficult to understand that the Negro is sick and tired of having reluctantly parceled out to him those rights and privileges which all others receive upon birth or entry in America? I never cease to wonder at the amazing presumption of much of white society, assuming that they have the right to bargain with the Negro for his freedom. This continued arrogant ladling out of pieces of the rights of citizenship has begun to generate a fury in the Negro. Even so, he is not pressing for revenge, or for conquest, or to gain spoils, or to enslave, or even to marry the sisters of those who have injured him. What the Negro wants\u2014and will not stop until he gets\u2014is absolute and unqualified freedom and equality here in this land of his birth, and not in Africa or in some imaginary state. The Negro no longer will be tolerant of anything less than his due right and heritage. He is pursuing only that which he knows is honorably his. He knows that he is right.\n\nBut every Negro leader since the turn of the century has been saying this in one form or another. It is because we have been so long and so conscientiously ignored by the dominant white society that the situation has now reached such crisis proportions. Few white people, even today, will face the clear fact that the very future and destiny of this country are tied up in what answer will be given to the Negro. And that answer must be given soon.\n\nPlayboy: Relatively few dispute the justness of the struggle to eradicate racial injustice, but many whites feel that the Negro should be more patient, that only the passage of time\u2014perhaps generations\u2014will bring about the sweeping changes he demands in traditional attitudes and customs. Do you think this is true?\n\nKing: No, I do not. I feel that the time is always right to do what is right. Where progress for the Negro in America is concerned, there is a tragic misconception of time among whites. They seem to cherish a strange, irrational notion that something in the very flow of time will cure all ills. In truth, time itself is only neutral. Increasingly, I feel that time has been used destructively by people of ill will much more than it has been used constructively by those of good will.\n\nIf I were to select a timetable for the equalization of human rights, it would be the intent of the \"all deliberate speed\" specified in the historic 1954 Supreme Court decision. But what has happened? A Supreme Court decision was met, and balked, with utter defiance. Ten years later, in most areas of the South, less than one percent of the Negro children have been integrated in schools, and in some of the deepest South, not even one tenth of one percent. Approximately 25 percent of employable Negro youth, for another example, are presently unemployed. Though many would prefer not to, we must face the fact that progress for the Negro\u2014to which white \"moderates\" like to point in justifying gradualism\u2014has been relatively insignificant, particularly in terms of the Negro masses. What little progress has been made\u2014and that includes the Civil Rights Act\u2014has applied primarily to the middle-class Negro. Among the masses, especially in the Northern ghettos, the situation remains about the same, and for some it is worse.\n\nPlayboy: It would seem that much could be done at the local, state and Federal levels to remedy these inequities. In your own contact with them, have you found Government officials\u2014in the North, if not in the South\u2014to be generally sympathetic, understanding, and receptive to appeals for reform?\n\nKing: On the contrary, I have been dismayed at the degree to which abysmal ignorance seems to prevail among many state, city and even Federal officials on the whole question of racial justice and injustice. Particularly, I have found that these men seriously\u2014and dangerously\u2014underestimate the explosive mood of the Negro and the gravity of the crisis. Even among those whom I would consider to be both sympathetic and sincerely intellectually committed, there is a lamentable lack of understanding. But this white failure to comprehend the depth and dimension of the Negro problem is far from being peculiar to Government officials. Apart from bigots and backlashers, it seems to be a malady even among those whites who like to regard themselves as \"enlightened.\" I would especially refer to those who counsel, \"Wait!\" and to those who say that they sympathize with our goals but cannot condone our methods of direct-action pursuit of those goals. I wonder at men who dare to feel that they have some paternalistic right to set the timetable for another man's liberation. Over the past several years, I must say, I have been gravely disappointed with such white \"moderates.\" I am often inclined to think that they are more of a stumbling block to the Negro's progress than the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner.\n\nPlayboy: Haven't both of these segregationist societies been implicated in connection with plots against your life?\n\nKing: It's difficult to trace the authorship of these death threats. I seldom go through a day without one. Some are telephoned anonymously to my office; others are sent\u2014unsigned, of course\u2014through the mails. Drew Pearson wrote not long ago about one group of unknown affiliation that was committed to assassinate not only me but also Chief Justice Warren and President Johnson. And not long ago, when I was about to visit in Mississippi, I received some very urgent calls from Negro leaders in Mobile, who had been told by a very reliable source that a sort of guerrilla group led by a retired major in the area of Lucyville, Mississippi, was plotting to take my life during the visit. I was strongly urged to cancel the trip, but when I thought about it, I decided that I had no alternative but to go on into Mississippi.\n\nPlayboy: Why?\n\nKing: Because I have a job to do. If I were constantly worried about death, I couldn't function. After a while, if your life is more or less constantly in peril, you come to a point where you accept the possibility philosophically. I must face the fact, as all others in positions of leadership must do, that America today is an extremely sick nation, and that something could well happen to me at any time. I feel, though, that my cause is so right, so moral, that if I should lose my life, in some way it would aid the cause.\n\nPlayboy: That statement exemplifies the total dedication to the civil rights movement for which you are so widely admired\u2014but also denounced as an \"extremist\" by such segregationist spokesmen as Alabama's Governor Wallace. Do you accept this identification?\n\nKing: It disturbed me when I first heard it. But when I began to consider the true meaning of the word, I decided that perhaps I would like to think of myself as an extremist\u2014in the light of the spirit which made Jesus an extremist for love. If it sounds as though I am comparing myself to the Savior, let me remind you that all who honor themselves with the claim of being \"Christians\" should compare themselves to Jesus. Thus I consider myself an extremist for that brotherhood of man which Paul so nobly expressed: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Love is the only force on earth that can be dispensed or received in an extreme manner, without any qualifications, without any harm to the giver or to the receiver.\n\nPlayboy: Perhaps. But the kind of extremism for which you've been criticized has to do not with love, but with your advocacy of willful disobedience of what you consider to be \"unjust laws.\" Do you feel you have the right to pass judgment on and defy the law\u2014nonviolently or otherwise?\n\nKing: Yes\u2014morally, if not legally. For there are two kinds of laws: man's and God's. A man-made code that squares with the moral law, or the law of God, is a just law. But a man-made code that is inharmonious with the moral law is an unjust law. And an unjust law, as St. Augustine said, is no law at all. Thus a law that is unjust is morally null and void, and must be defied until it is legally null and void as well. Let us not forget, in the memories of 6,000,000 who died, that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \"legal,\" and that everything the Freedom Fighters in Hungary did was \"illegal.\" In spite of that, I am sure that I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers if I had lived in Germany during Hitler's reign, as some Christian priests and ministers did do, often at the cost of their lives. And if I lived now in a Communist country where principles dear to the Christian's faith are suppressed, I know that I would openly advocate defiance of that country's antireligious laws\u2014again, just as some Christian priests and ministers are doing today behind the Iron Curtain. Right here in America today there are white ministers, priests and rabbis who have shed blood in the support of our struggle against a web of human injustice, much of which is supported by immoral man-made laws.\n\nPlayboy: Segregation laws?\n\nKing: Specifically, court injunctions. Though the rights of the First Amendment guarantee that any citizen or group of citizens may engage in peaceable assembly, the South has seized upon the device of invoking injunctions to block our direct-action civil rights demonstrations. When you get set to stage a nonviolent demonstration, the city simply secures an injunction to cease and desist. Southern courts are well known for \"sitting on\" this type of case; conceivably a two- or three-year delay could be incurred. At first we found this to be a highly effective subterfuge against us. We first experienced it in Montgomery when, during the bus boycott, our car pool was outlawed by an injunction. An injunction also destroyed the protest movement in Talladega, Alabama. Another injunction outlawed the oldest civil rights organization, the NAACP, from the whole state of Alabama. Still another injunction thwarted our organization's efforts in Albany, Georgia. Then in Birmingham, we felt that we had to take a stand and disobey a court injunction against demonstrations, knowing the consequences and being prepared to meet them\u2014or the unjust law would break our movement.\n\nWe did not take this step hastily or rashly. We gave the matter intense thought and prayer before deciding that the right thing was being done. And when we made our decision, I announced our plan to the press, making it clear that we were not anarchists advocating lawlessness, but that in good conscience we could not comply with a misuse of the judicial process in order to perpetuate injustice and segregation. When our plan was made known, it bewildered and immobilized our segregationist opponents. We felt that our decision had been morally as well as tactically right\u2014in keeping with God's law as well as with the spirit of our nonviolent direct-action program.\n\nPlayboy: If it's morally right for supporters of civil rights to violate segregation laws which they consider unjust, why is it wrong for segregationists to resist the enforcement of integration laws which they consider unjust?\n\nKing: Because segregation, as even the segregationists know in their hearts, is morally wrong and sinful. If it weren't, the white South would not be haunted as it is by a deep sense of guilt for what it has done to the Negro\u2014guilt for patronizing him, degrading him, brutalizing him, depersonalizing him, thingifying him; guilt for lying to itself. This is the source of the schizophrenia that the South will suffer until it goes through its crisis of conscience.\n\nPlayboy: Is this crisis imminent?\n\nKing: It may not come next week or next year, but it is certainly more imminent in the South than in the North. If the South is honest with itself, it may well outdistance the North in the improvement of race relations.\n\nPlayboy: Why?\n\nKing: Well, the Northern white, having had little actual contact with the Negro, is devoted to an abstract principle of cordial interracial relations. The North has long considered, in a theoretical way, that it supported brotherhood and the equality of man, but the truth is that deep prejudices and discriminations exist in hidden and subtle and covert disguises. The South's prejudice and discrimination, on the other hand, has been applied against the Negro in obvious, open, overt and glaring forms\u2014which make the problem easier to get at. The Southern white man has the advantage of far more actual contact with Negroes than the Northerner. A major problem is that this contact has been paternalistic and poisoned by the myth of racial superiority.\n\nPlayboy: Many Southern whites, supported by the \"research\" of several Southern anthropologists, vow that white racial superiority\u2014and Negro inferiority\u2014are a biological fact.\n\nKing: You may remember that during the rise of Nazi Germany, a rash of books by respected German scientists appeared, supporting the master-race theory. This utterly ignorant fallacy has been so thoroughly refuted by the social scientists, as well as by medical science, that any individual who goes on believing it is standing in an absolutely misguided and diminishing circle. The American Anthropological Association has unanimously adopted a resolution repudiating statements that Negroes are biologically, in innate mental ability or in any other way inferior to whites. The collective weight and authority of world scientists are embodied in a Unesco report on races which flatly refutes the theory of innate superiority among any ethnic group. And as far as Negro \"blood\" is concerned, medical science finds the same four blood types in all race groups.\n\nWhen the Southern white finally accepts this simple fact\u2014as he eventually must\u2014beautiful results will follow, for we will have come a long way toward transforming his master-servant perspective into a person-to-person perspective. The Southern white man, discovering the \"nonmyth\" Negro, exhibits all the passion of the new convert, seeing the black man as a man among men for the first time. The South, if it is to survive economically, must make dramatic changes, and these must include the Negro. People of good will in the South, who are the vast majority, have the challenge to be open and honest, and to turn a deaf ear to the shrill cries of the irresponsible few on the lunatic fringe. I think and pray they will.\n\nPlayboy: Whom do you include among \"the irresponsible few\"?\n\nKing: I include those who preach racism and commit violence; and those who, in various cities where we have sought to peacefully demonstrate, have sought to goad Negroes into violence as an excuse for violent mass reprisal. In Birmingham, for example, on the day it was flashed about the world that a \"peace pact\" had been signed between the moderate whites and the Negroes, Birmingham's segregationist forces reacted with fury, swearing vengeance against the white businessmen who had \"betrayed\" them by negotiating with Negroes. On Saturday night, just outside of Birmingham, a Ku Klux Klan meeting was held, and that same night, as I mentioned earlier, a bomb ripped the home of my brother, the Reverend A. D. King, and another bomb was planted where it would have killed or seriously wounded anyone in the motel room which I had been occupying. Both bombings had been timed just as Birmingham's bars closed on Saturday midnight, as the streets filled with thousands of Negroes who were not trained in nonviolence, and who had been drinking. Just as whoever planted the bombs had wanted to happen, fighting began, policemen were stoned by Negroes, cars were overturned and fires started.\n\nPlayboy: Were none of your S.C.L.C. workers involved?\n\nKing: If they had been, there would have been no riot, for we believe that only just means may be used in seeking a just end. We believe that lasting gains can be made\u2014and they have been made\u2014only by practicing what we preach: a policy of nonviolent, peaceful protest. The riots, North and South, have involved mobs\u2014not the disciplined, nonviolent, direct-action demonstrators with whom I identify. We do not condone lawlessness, looting and violence committed by the racist or the reckless of any color.\n\nI must say, however, that riots such as have occurred do achieve at least one partially positive effect: They dramatically focus national attention upon the Negro's discontent. Unfortunately, they also give the white majority an excuse, a provocation, to look away from the cause of the riots\u2014the poverty and the deprivation and the degradation of the Negro, especially in the slums and ghettos where the riots occur\u2014and to talk instead of looting, and of the breakdown of law and order. It is never circulated that some of the looters have been white people, similarly motivated by their own poverty. In one riot in a Northern city, aside from the Negroes and Puerto Ricans who were arrested, there were also 158 white people\u2014including mothers stealing food, children's shoes and other necessity items. The poor, white and black, were rebelling together against the establishment.\n\nPlayboy: Whom do you mean by \"the establishment\"?\n\nKing: I mean the white leadership\u2014which I hold as responsible as anyone for the riots, for not removing the conditions that cause them. The deep frustration, the seething desperation of the Negro today is a product of slum housing, chronic poverty, woefully inadequate education and substandard schools. The Negro is trapped in a long and desolate corridor with no exit sign, caught in a vicious socioeconomic vise. And he is ostracized as is no other minority group in America by the evil of oppressive and constricting prejudice based solely upon his color. A righteous man has no alternative but to resist such an evil system. If he does not have the courage to resist nonviolently, then he runs the risk of a violent emotional explosion. As much as I deplore violence, there is one evil that is worse than violence, and that's cowardice. It is still my basic article of faith that social justice can be achieved and democracy advanced only to the degree that there is firm adherence to nonviolent action and resistance in the pursuit of social justice. But America will be faced with the ever-present threat of violence, rioting and senseless crime as long as Negroes by the hundreds of thousands are packed into malodorous, rat-plagued ghettos; as long as Negroes remain smothered by poverty in the midst of an affluent society; as long as Negroes are made to feel like exiles in their own land; as long as Negroes continue to be dehumanized; as long as Negroes see their freedom endlessly delayed and diminished by the head winds of tokenism and small handouts from the white power structure. No nation can suffer any greater tragedy than to cause millions of its citizens to feel that they have no stake in their own society.\n\nUnderstand that I am trying only to explain the reasons for violence and the threat of violence. Let me say again that by no means and under no circumstance do I condone outbreaks of looting and lawlessness. I feel that every responsible Negro leader must point out, with all possible vigor, that anyone who perpetrates and participates in a riot is immoral as well as impractical\u2014that the use of immoral means will not achieve the moral end of racial justice.\n\nPlayboy: Whom do you consider the most responsible Negro leaders?\n\nKing: Well, I would say that Roy Wilkins of the NAACP has proved time and again to be a very articulate spokesman for the rights of Negroes. He is a most able administrator and a dedicated organization man with personal resources that have helped the whole struggle. Another outstanding man is Whitney Young Jr. of the National Urban League, an extremely able social scientist. He has developed a meaningful balance between militancy and moderation. James Farmer of CORE is another courageous, dedicated and thoughtful civil rights spokesman. I have always been impressed by how he maintains a freshness in his awareness of the meaning of the whole quest for freedom. And John Lewis of SNCC symbolizes the kind of strong militancy, courage and creativity that our youth have brought to the civil rights struggle. But I feel that the greatest leader of these times that the Negro has produced is A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, whose total integrity, depth of dedication and caliber of statesmanship set an example for us all.\n\nPlayboy: Many whites feel that last summer's riots occurred because leadership is no longer being offered by the men you named.\n\nKing: The riots we have had are minute compared to what would have happened without their effective and restraining leadership. I am convinced that unless the nonviolent philosophy had emerged and taken hold among Negroes, North and South, by today the streets of dozens of American communities would have flowed with blood. Hundreds of cities might now be mourning countless dead, of both races, were it not for the nonviolent influence which has given political surgeons the time and opportunity to boldly and safely excise some aspects of the peril of violence that faced this nation in the summers of 1963 and 1964. The whole world has seen what happened in communities such as Harlem, Brooklyn, Rochester, Philadelphia, Newark, St. Petersburg and Birmingham, where this emergency operation was either botched or not performed at all.\n\nPlayboy: Still, doesn't the very fact that riots have occurred tend to indicate that many Negroes are no longer heeding the counsels of nonviolence?\n\nKing: Not the majority, by any means. But it is true that some Negroes subscribe to a deep feeling that the tactic of nonviolence is not producing enough concrete victories. We have seen, in our experience, that nonviolence thrives best in a climate of justice. Violence grows to the degree that injustice prevails; the more injustice in a given community, the more violence, or potential violence, smolders in that community. I can give you a clear example. If you will notice, there have been fewer riots in the South. The reason for this is that the Negro in the South can see some visible, concrete victories in civil rights. Last year, the police would have been called if he sat down at a community lunch counter. This year, if he chooses to sit at that counter, he is served. More riots have occurred in the North because the fellow in Harlem, to name one Northern ghetto, can't see any victories. He remains throttled, as he has always been, by vague, intangible economic and social deprivations. Until the concerned power structures begin to grapple creatively with these fundamental inequities, it will be difficult for violence to be eliminated. The longer our people see no progress, or halting progress, the easier it will be for them to yield to the counsels of hatred and demagoguery.",

Burton", "Arabian Nights, Vol. 6 (Chap. 2) Lyrics\n\nThe City Of Brass.[FN#104]\n\nIt is related that there was, in tide of yore and in times and years long gone before, at Damascus of Syria, a Caliph known as Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth of the Ommiade house. As this Commander of the Faithful was seated one day in his palace, conversing with his Sultans and Kings and the Grandees of his empire, the talk turned upon the legends of past peoples and the traditions of our lord Solomon, David's son (on the twain be peace!), and on that which Allah Almighty had bestowed on him of lordship and dominion over men and Jinn and birds and beasts and reptiles and the wind and other created things; and quoth the Caliph, \"Of a truth we hear from those who forewent us that the Lord (extolled and exalted be He!) vouchsafed unto none the like of that which He vouchsafed unto our lord Solomon and that he attained unto that whereto never attained other than he, in that he was wont to imprison Jinns and Marids and Satans in cucurbites of copper and to stop them with lead and seal[FN#105] them with his ring.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Caliph Abd al-Malik bin Marwan sat conversing with his Grandees concerning our lord Solomon, and these noted what Allah had bestowed upon him of lordship and dominion, quoth the Commander of the Faithful, \"Indeed he attained unto that whereto never attained other than he, in that he was wont to imprison Jinns and Marids and Satans in cucurbites of copper and stop them with lead and seal them with his ring.\" Then said Talib bin Sahl (who was a seeker after treasures and had books that discovered to him hoards and wealth hidden under the earth), \"O Commander of the Faithful,\u2014Allah make thy dominion to endure and exalt thy dignity here and hereafter!\u2014my father told me of my grandfather, that he once took ship with a company, intending for the island of Sikiliyah or Sicily, and sailed until there arose against them a contrary wind, which drove them from their course and brought them, after a month, to a great mountain in one of the lands of Allah the Most High, but where that land was they wot not. Quoth my grandfather:\u2014\u2018This was in the darkness of the night and as soon as it was day, there came forth to us, from the caves of the mountain, folk black of colour and naked of body, as they were wild beasts, understanding not one word of what was addressed to them; nor was there any of them who knew Arabic, save their King who was of their own kind. When he saw the ship, he came down to it with a company of his followers and saluting us, bade us welcome and questioned us of our case and our faith. We told him all concerning ourselves and he said, \u2018Be of good cheer for no harm shall befal you.' And when we, in turn, asked them of their faith, we found that each was of one of the many creeds prevailing before the preaching of Al-Islam and the mission of Mohammed, whom may Allah bless and keep! So my shipmates remarked, We wot not what thou sayest.' Then quoth the King, \u2018No Adam-son hath ever come to our land before you: but fear not, and rejoice in the assurance of safety and of return to your own country.' Then he entertained us three days, feeding us on the flesh of birds and wild beasts and fishes, than which they had no other meat; and, on the fourth day, he carried us down to the beach, that we might divert ourselves by looking upon the fisher- folk. There we saw a man casting his net to catch fish, and presently he pulled them up and behold, in them was a cucurbite of copper, stopped with lead and sealed with the signet of Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace! He brought the vessel to land and broke it open, when there came forth a smoke, which rose a-twisting blue to the zenith, and we heard a horrible voice, saying, \u2018I repent! I repent! Pardon, O Prophet of Allah! I will never return to that which I did aforetime.' Then the smoke became a terrible Giant frightful of form, whose head was level with the mountain-tops, and he vanished from our sight, whilst our hearts were well-nigh torn out for terror; but the blacks thought nothing of it. Then we returned to the King and questioned him of the matter; whereupon quoth he, \u2018Know that this was one of the Jinns whom Solomon, son of David, being wroth with them, shut up in these vessels and cast into the sea, after stopping the mouths with melted lead. Our fishermen ofttimes, in casting their nets, bring up such bottles, which being broken open, there come forth of them Jinnis who, deeming that Solomon is still alive and can pardon them, make their submission to him and say, I repent, O Prophet of Allah!'\" The Caliph marvelled at Talib's story and said, \"Glory be to God! Verily, to Solomon was given a mighty dominion.\" Now al-N\u00e1bighah al-Zuby\u00e1n\u00ed[FN#106] was present, and he said, \"Talib hath spoken soothly as is proven by the saying of the All-wise, the Prim\u00e6val One,\n\n\u2018And Solomon, when Allah to him said, * \u2018Rise, be thou Caliph,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     rule with righteous sway:\nHonour obedience for obeying thee; * And who rebels imprison him\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     for aye'\n\nWherefore he used to put them in copper-bottles and cast them into the sea.\" The poet's words seemed good to the Caliph, and he said, \"By Allah, I long to look upon some of these Solomonic vessels, which must be a warning to whoso will be warned.\" \"O Commander of the Faithful,\" replied Talib, \"it is in thy power to do so, without stirring abroad. Send to thy brother Abd al-Aziz bin Marw\u00e1n, so he may write to M\u00fas\u00e1 bin Nusayr,[FN#107] governor of the Maghrib or Morocco, bidding him take horse thence to the mountains whereof I spoke and fetch thee therefrom as many of such cucurbites as thou hast a mind to; for those mountains adjoin the frontiers of his province.\" The Caliph approved his counsel and said \"Thou hast spoken sooth, O Talib, and I desire that, touching this matter, thou be my messenger to Musa bin Nusayr; wherefore thou shalt have the White Flag[FN#108] and all thou hast a mind to of monies and honour and so forth; and I will care for thy family during thine absence.\" \"With love and gladness, O Commander of the Faithful!\" answered Talib. \"Go, with the blessing of Allah and His aid,\" quoth the Caliph, and bade write a letter to his brother, Abd al-Aziz, his viceroy in Egypt, and another to Musa bin Nusayr, his viceroy in North Western Africa, bidding him go himself in quest of the Solomonic bottles, leaving his son to govern in his stead. Moreover, he charged him to engage guides and to spare neither men nor money, nor to be remiss in the matter as he would take no excuse. Then he sealed the two letters and committed them to Talib bin Sahl, bidding him advance the royal ensigns before him and make his utmost speed and he gave him treasure and horsemen and footmen, to further him on his way, and made provision for the wants of his household during his absence. So Talib set out and arrived in due course at Cairo.[FN#109]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Talib bin Sahl set out with his escort and crossed the desert country between Syria and Egypt, where the Governor came out to meet him and entreated him and his company with high honour whilst they tarried with him. Then he gave them a guide to bring them to the Sa'\u00edd or Upper Egypt, where the Emir Musa had his abiding-place; and when the son of Nusayr heard of Talib's coming, he went forth to meet him and rejoiced in him. Talib gave him the Caliph's letter, and he took it reverently and, laying it on his head, cried, \"I hear and I obey the Prince of the Faithful.\" Then he deemed it best to assemble his chief officers and when all were present he acquainted them with the contents of the Caliph's letter and sought counsel of them how he should act. \"O Emir,\" answered they, \"if thou seek one who shall guide thee to the place summon the Shaykh 'Abd al-Samad, ibn 'Abd al-Kudd\u00fas, al- Sam\u00fad\u00ed;[FN#110] for he is a man of varied knowledge, who hath travelled much and knoweth by experience all the seas and wastes and words and countries of the world and the inhabitants and wonders thereof; wherefore send thou for him and he will surely guide thee to thy desire.\" So Musa sent for him, and behold, he was a very ancient man shot in years and broken down with lapse of days. The Emir saluted him and said, \"O Shaykh Abd al-Samad, our lord the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan' hath commanded me thus and thus. I have small knowledge of the land wherein is that which the Caliph desireth; but it is told me that thou knowest it well and the ways thither. Wilt thou, therefore, go with me and help me to accomplish the Caliph's need? So it please Allah the Most High, thy trouble and travail shall not go waste.\" Replied the Shaykh, \"I hear and obey the bidding of the Commander of the Faithful; but know, O Emir, that the road thither is long and difficult and the ways few.\" \"How far is it?\" asked Musa, and the Shaykh answered, \"It is a journey of two years and some months going and the like returning; and the way is full of hardships and terrors and things wondrous and marvellous. Now thou art a champion of the Faith[FN#111] and our country is hard by that of the enemy; and peradventure the Nazarenes may come out upon us in thine absence; wherefore it behoveth thee to leave one to rule thy government in thy stead.\" \"It is well,\" answered the Emir and appointed his son H\u00e1r\u00fan Governor during his absence, requiring the troops to take the oath of fealty to him and bidding them obey him in all he should com mend. And they heard his words and promised obedience. Now this Harun was a man of great prowess and a renowned warrior and a doughty knight, and the Shaykh Abd al-Samad feigned to him that the place they sought was distant but four months' journey along the shore of the sea, with camping-places all the way, adjoining one another, and grass and springs, adding, \"Allah will assuredly make the matter easy to us through thy blessing, O Lieutenant of the Commander of the Faithful!\" Quoth the Emir Musa, \"Knowest thou if any of the Kings have trodden this land before us?\"; and quoth the Shaykh, \"Yes, it belonged aforetime to Darius the Greek, King of Alexandria.\" But he said to Musa privily, \"O Emir, take with thee a thousand camels laden with victual and store of gugglets.\"[FN#112] The Emir asked, \"And what shall we do with these?\", and the Shaykh answered. \"On our way is the desert of Kayrw\u00e1n or Cyrene, the which is a vast wold four days' journey long, and lacketh water; nor therein doth sound of voice ever sound nor is soul at any time to be seen. Moreover, there bloweth the Simoon[FN#113] and other hot winds called Al-Juwayb, which dry up the water-skins; but if the water be in gugglets, no harm can come to it.\" \"Right,\" said Musa and sending to Alexandria, let bring thence great plenty of gugglets. Then he took with him his Wazir and two thousand cavalry, clad in mail cap-\u00e1-pie and set out, without other to guide them but Abd al-Samad who forewent them, riding on his hackney. The party fared on diligently, now passing through inhabited lands, then ruins and anon traversing frightful words and thirsty wastes and then mountains which spired high in air; nor did they leave journeying a whole year's space till, one morning, when the day broke, after they had travelled all night, behold, the Shaykh found himself in a land he knew not and said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Quoth the Emir, \"What is to do, O Shaykh?\"; and he answered, saying, \"By the Lord of the Ka'abah, we have wandered from our road!\" \"How cometh that?\" asked Musa, and Abd al-Samad replied, \"The stars were overclouded and I could not guide myself by them.\" \"Where on God's earth are we now?\" asked the Emir, and the Shaykh answered, \"I know not; for I never set eyes on this land till this moment.\" Said Musa, \"Guide us back to the place where we went astray\", but the other, \"I know it no more.\" Then Musa, \"Let us push on; haply Allah will guide us to it or direct us aright of His power.\" So they fared on till the hour of noon-prayer, when they came to a fair champaign, and wide and level and smooth as it were the sea when calm, and presently there appeared to them, on the horizon some great thing, high and black, in whose midst was as it were smoke rising to the confines of the sky. They made for this, and stayed not in their course till they drew near thereto, when, lo! it was a high castle, firm of foundations and great and gruesome, as it were a towering mountain, builded all of black stone, with frowning crenelles and a door of gleaming China steel, that dazzled the eyes and dazed the wits. Round about it were a thousand steps and that which appeared afar off as it were smoke was a central dome of lead an hundred cubits high. When the Emir saw this, he marvelled thereat with exceeding marvel and how this place was void of inhabitants; and the Shaykh, after he had certified himself thereof, said, \"There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God!\" Quoth Musa, \"I hear thee praise the Lord and hallow Him, and meseemeth thou rejoicest.\" \"O Emir,\" answered Abd al-Samad, \"Rejoice, for Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) hath delivered us from the frightful words and thirsty wastes.\" \"How knowest thou that?\" said Musa, and the other, \"I know it for that my father told me of my grandfather that he said, \u2018We were once journeying in this land and, straying from the road, we came to this palace and thence to the City of Brass; between which and the place thou seekest is two full months' travel; but thou must take to the sea-shore and leave it not, for there be watering-places and wells and camping-grounds established by King Z\u00fa al-Karnayn Iskandar who, when he went to the conquest of Mauritania, found by the way thirsty deserts and wastes and wilds and dug therein water-pits and built cisterns.' \" Quoth Musa, \"Allah rejoice thee with good news!\" and quoth the Shaykh, \"Come, let us go look upon yonder palace and its marvels, for it is an admonition to whose will be admonished.\" So the Emir went up to the palace, with the Shaykh and his officers, and coming to the gate, found it open. Now this gate was builded with lofty columns and porticoes whose walls and ceilings were inlaid with gold and silver and precious stones; and there led up to it flights of steps, among which were two wide stairs of coloured marble, never was seen their like; and over the doorway was a tablet whereon were graven letters of gold in the old ancient Ionian character. \"O Emir,\" asked the Shaykh, \"Shall I read?\"; and Musa answered, \"Read and God bless thee!; for all that betideth us in this journey dependeth upon thy blessing.\" So the Shaykh, who was a very learned man and versed in all tongues and characters, went up to the tablet and read whatso was thereon and it was verse like this,\n\n\"The signs that here their mighty works portray * Warn us that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     all must tread the self-same way:\nO thou who standest in this stead to hear * Tidings of folk,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     whose power hath passed for aye,\nEnter this palace-gate and ask the news * Of greatness fallen\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     into dust and clay:\nDeath has destroyed them and dispersed their might * And in the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     dust they lost their rich display;\nAs had they only set their burdens down * To rest awhile, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    then had rode away.\"\n\nWhen the Emir Musa heard these couplets, he wept till he lost his senses and said, \"There is no god but the God, the Living, the Eternal, who ceaseth not!\" Then he entered the palace and was confounded at its beauty and the goodliness of its construction. He diverted himself awhile by viewing the pictures and images therein, till he came to another door, over which also were written verses, and said to the Shaykh, \"Come read me these!\" So he advanced and read as follows,\n\n\"Under these domes how many a company * Halted of old and fared\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     with-outen stay:\nSee thou what might displays on other wights * Time with his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     shifts which could such lords waylay:\nThey shared together what they gathered * And left their joys and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     fared to Death-decay:\nWhat joys they joyed! what food they ate! and now * In dust\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     they're eaten, for the worm a prey.\"\n\nAt this the Emir Musa wept bitter tears; and the world waxed yellow before his eyes and he said, \"Verily, we were created for a mighty matter!\"[FN#114] Then they proceeded to explore the palace and found it desert and void of living thing, its courts desolate and dwelling places waste laid. In the midst stood a lofty pavilion with a dome rising high in air, and about it were four hundred tombs, builded of yellow marble. The Emir drew near unto these and behold, amongst them was a great tomb, wide and long; and at its head stood a tablet of white marble, whereon were graven these couplets,\n\n\"How oft have I fought! and how many have slain! * How much have\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    I witnessed of blessing and bane!\nHow much have I eaten! how much have I drunk! * How oft have I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     hearkened to singing-girl's strain!\nHow much have I bidden! how oft have forbid! * How many a castle\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    and castellain\nI have sieged and have searched, and the cloistered maids * In\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    the depths of its walls for my captives were ta'en!\nBut of ignorance sinned I to win me the meeds * Which won proved\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    naught and brought nothing of gain:\nThen reckon thy reck'ning, O man, and be wise * Ere the goblet of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    death and of doom thou shalt drain;\nFor yet but a little the dust on thy head * They shall strew, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thy life shall go down to the dead.\"\n\nThe Emir and his companions wept; then, drawing near unto the pavilion, they saw that it had eight doors of sandal-wood, studded with nails of gold and stars of silver and inlaid with all manner precious stones. On the first door were written these verses,\n\n\"What I left, I left it not for nobility of soul, * But through\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     sentence and decree that to every man are dight.\nWhat while I lived happy, with a temper haught and high, * My\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    hoarding-place defending like a lion in the fight,\nI took no rest, and greed of gain forbad me give a grain * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    mustard seed to save from the fires of Hell my sprite,\nUntil stricken on a day, as with arrow, by decree * Of the Maker,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    the Fashioner, the Lord of Might and Right.\nWhen my death was appointed, my life I could not keep * By the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    many of my stratagems, my cunning and my sleight:\nMy troops I had collected availed me not, and none * Of my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    friends and of my neighbours had power to mend my plight:\nThrough my life I was weaned in journeying to death * In stress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     or in solace, in joyance or despight:\nSo when money-bags are bloated, and dinar unto dinar * Thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     addest, all may leave thee with fleeting of the night:\nAnd the driver of a camel and the digger of a grave[FN#115] * Are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     what thine heirs shall bring ere the morning dawneth bright:\nAnd on Judgment Day alone shalt thou stand before thy Lord, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Overladen with thy sins and thy crimes and thine affright:\nLet the world not seduce thee with lurings, but behold * What\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     measure to thy family and neighbours it hath doled.\"\n\nWhen Musa heard these verses, he wept with such weeping that he swooned away; then, coming to himself, he entered the pavilion and saw therein a long tomb, awesome to look upon, whereon was a tablet of China steel and Shaykh Abd al-Samad drew near it and read this inscription: \"In the name of Ever-lasting Allah, the Never-beginning, the Never-ending; in the name of Allah who begetteth not nor is He begot and unto whom the like is not; in the name of Allah the Lord of Majesty and Might; in the name of the Living One who to death is never dight!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shaykh Abd al-Samad, having read the aforesaid, also found the following, \"O thou who comest to this place, take warning by that which thou seest of the accidents of Time and the vicissitudes of Fortune and be not deluded by the world and its pomps and vanities and fallacies and falsehoods and vain allurements, for that it is flattering, deceitful end treacherous, and the things thereof are but a loan to us which it will borrow back from all borrowers. It is like unto the dreams of the dreamer and the sleep-visions of the sleeper or as the mirage of the desert, which the thirsty take for water;[FN#116] and Satan maketh it fair for men even unto death These are the ways of the world; wherefore put not thou thy trust therein neither incline thereto, for it betrayeth him who leaneth upon it and who committeth himself thereunto in his affairs. Fall not thou into its snares neither take hold upon its skirts, but be warned by my example. I possessed four thou sand bay horses and a haughty palace, and I had to wife a thou sand daughters of kings, high-bosomed maids, as they were moons: I was blessed with a thousand sons as they were fierce lions, and I abode a thousand years, glad of heart and mind, and I amassed treasures beyond the competence of all the Kings of the regions of the earth, deeming that delight would still endure to me. But there fell on me unawares the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies, the Desolator of domiciles and the Spoiler of inhabited spots, the Murtherer of great and small, babes and children and mothers, he who hath no ruth on the poor for his poverty, or feareth the King for all his bidding or forbidding. Verily, we abode safe and secure in this palace, till there descended upon us the judgment of the Lord of the Three Worlds, Lord of the Heavens, and Lord of the Earths, the vengeance of the Manifest Truth[FN#117] overtook us, when there died of us every day two, till a great company of us had perished. When I saw that destruction had entered our dwellings and had homed with us and in the sea of deaths had drowned us, I summoned a writer and bade him indite these verses and instances and admonitions, the which I let grave, with rule and compass, on these doors and tablets and tombs. Now I had an army of a thousand thousand bridles, men of warrior mien with forearms strong and keen, armed with spears and mail-coats sheen and swords that gleam; so I bade them don their long-hanging hauberks and gird on their biting blades and mount their high-mettled steeds and level their dreadful lances; and whenas there fell on us the doom of the Lord of heaven and earth, I said to them, \u2018Ho, all ye soldiers and troopers, can ye avail to ward off that which is fallen on me from the Omnipotent King?' But troopers and soldiers availed not unto this and said, \u2018How shall we battle with Him to whom no chamberlain barreth access, the Lord of the door which hath no doorkeeper?' Then quoth I to them, \u2018Bring me my treasures' Now I had in my treasuries a thousand cisterns in each of which were a thousand quintals[FN#118] of red gold and the like of white silver, besides pearls and jewels of all kinds and other things of price, beyond the attainment of the kings of the earth. So they did that and when they had laid all the treasure in my presence, I said to them, \u2018Can ye ransom me with all this treasure or buy me one day of life therewith?' But they could not! So they resigned themselves to fore-ordained Fate and fortune and I submitted to the judgment of Allah, enduring patiently that which he decreed unto me of affliction, till He took my soul and made me to dwell in my grave. And if thou ask of my name, I am K\u00fash, the son of Shadd\u00e1d son of \u00c1d the Greater.\" And upon the tablets were engraved these lines,\n\n\"An thou wouldst know my name, whose day is done * With shifts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   time and chances 'neath the sun,\nKnow I am Shadd\u00e1d's son, who ruled mankind * And o'er all earth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  upheld dominion!\nAll stubborn peoples abject were to me; * And Sh\u00e1m to Cairo and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   to Adnanwone;[FN#119]\nI reigned in glory conquering many kings; * And peoples feared my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   mischief every one.\nYea, tribes and armies in my hand I saw; * The world all dreaded\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     me, both friends and fone.\nWhen I took horse, I viewed my numbered troops, * Bridles on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    neighing steeds a million.\nAnd I had wealth that none could tell or count, * Against\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    misfortune treasuring all I won;\nFain had I bought my life with all my wealth, * And for a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     moment's space my death to shun;\nBut God would naught save what His purpose willed; * So from my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     brethren cut I 'bode alone:\nAnd Death, that sunders man, exchanged my lot * To pauper hut\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     from grandeur's mansion\nWhen found I all mine actions gone and past * Wherefor I'm\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     pledged[FN#120] and by my sin undone.\nThen fear, O man, who by a brink dost range, * The turns of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Fortune and the chance of Change.\"\n\nThe Emir Musa was hurt to his heart and loathed his life for what he saw of the slaughtering-places of the folk; and, as they went about the highways and byeways of the palace, viewing its sitting-chambers and pleasaunces, behold they came upon a table of yellow onyx, upborne on four feet of juniper-wood,[FN#121] and there-on these words graven, \"At this table have eaten a thousand kings blind of the right eye and a thousand blind of the left and yet other thousand sound of both eyes, all of whom have departed the world and have taken up their sojourn in the tombs and the catacombs.\" All this the Emir wrote down and left the palace, carrying off with him naught save the table aforesaid. Then he fared on with his host three days' space, under the guidance of the Shaykh Abd al-Samad, till they came to a high hill, whereon stood a horseman of brass. In his hand he held a lance with a broad head, in brightness like blinding leven, whereon was graven, \"O thou that comest unto me, if thou know not the way to the City of Brass, rub the hand of this rider and he will turn round and presently stop. Then take the direction whereto he faceth and fare fearless, for it will bring thee, without hardship, to the city aforesaid.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Emir Musa rubbed the horseman's hand he revolved like the dazzling lightning, and stopped facing in a direction other than that wherein they were journeying. So they took the road to which he pointed (which was the right way) and, finding it a beaten track, fared on through their days and nights till they had covered a wide tract of country. Then they came upon a pillar of black stone like a furnace chimney wherein was one sunken up to his armpits. He had two great wings and four arms, two of them like the arms of the sons of Adam and other two as they were lion's paws, with claws of iron, and he was black and tall and frightful of aspect, with hair like horses' tails and eyes like blazing coals, slit upright in his face. Moreover, he had in the middle of his forehead a third eye, as it were that of a lynx, from which flew sparks of fire, and he cried out saying, \"Glory to my Lord, who hath adjudged unto me this grievous torment and sore punishment until the Day of Doom!\" When the folk saw him, they lost their reason for affright and turned to flee; so the Emir Musa asked the Shaykh Abd al-Samad, \"What is this?\"; and he answered, \"I know not.\" Whereupon quoth Musa, \"Draw near and question him of his condition; haply he will discover to thee his case.\" \"Allah assain thee, Emir! Indeed, I am afraid of him;\" replied the Shaykh; but the Emir rejoined, saying, \"Fear not; he is hindered from thee and from all others by that wherein he is.\" So Abd al-Samad drew near to the pillar and said to him which was therein, \"O creature, what is thy name and what art thou and how camest thou here in this fashion?\" \"I am an Ifrit of the Jinn,\" replied he, \"by name D\u00e1hish, son of Al-A'amash,[FN#122] and am confined here by the All-might, prisoned here by the Providence and punished by the judgement of Allah, till it pleases Him, to whom belong Might and Majesty, to release me.\" Then said Musa, \"Ask him why he is in durance of this column?\" So the Shaykh asked him of this, and the Ifrit replied, saying, \"Verily my tale is wondrous and my case marvellous, and it is this. One of the sons of Iblis had an idol of red carnelian, whereof I was guardian, and there served it a King of the Kings of the sea, a Prince of puissant power and prow of prowess, over-ruling a thousand thousand warriors of the Jann who smote with swords before him and answered his summons in time of need. All these were under my commandment and obeyed my behest, being each and every rebels against Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace! And I used to enter the belly of the idol and thence bid and forbid them. Now this King's daughter loved the idol and was frequent in prostration to it and assiduous in its service; and she was the fairest woman of her day, accomplished in beauty and loveliness, elegance and grace. She was described unto Solomon and he sent to her father, saying, \u2018Give me thy daughter to wife and break thine idol of carnelian and testify saying, There is no god but the God and Solomon is the Prophet of Allah!' an thou do this, our due shall be thy due and thy debt shall be our debt, but, if thou refuse, make ready to answer the summons of the Lord and don thy grave-gear, for I will come upon thee with an irresistible host, which shall fill the waste places of earth and make thee as yesterday that is passed away and hath no return for aye.' When this message reached the King, he waxed insolent and rebellious, pride-full and contumacious and he cried to his Wazirs, \u2018What say ye of this? Know ye that Solomon son of David hath sent requiring me to give him my daughter to wife, and break my idol of carnelian and enter his faith!' And they replied, \u2018O mighty King, how shall Solomon do thus with thee? Even could he come at thee in the midst of this vast ocean, he could not prevail against thee, for the Marids of the Jann will fight on thy side and thou wilt ask succour of thine idol whom thou servest, and he will help thee and give thee victory over him. So thou wouldst do well to consult on this matter thy Lord,' (meaning the idol aforesaid) \u2018and hear what he saith. If he say, Fight him, fight him, and if not, not.' So the King went in without stay or delay to his idol and offered up sacrifices and slaughtered victims; after which he fell down before him, prostrate and weeping, and repeated these verses,\n\n\u2018O my Lord, well I weet thy puissant hand: * Sulaym\u00e1n would break\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thee and see thee bann'd.\nO my Lord, to crave succour here I stand * Command and I bow to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thy high command!'\n\nThen I\" (continued the Ifrit addressing the Shaykh and those about him), \"of my ignorance and want of wit and recklessness of the commandment of Solomon and lack of knowledge anent his power, entered the belly of the idol and made answer as follows.\n\n\u2018As for me, of him I feel naught affright, * For my lore and my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     wisdom are infinite:\nIf he wish for warfare I'll show him fight * And out of his body\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     I'll tear his sprite!'\n\nWhen the King heard my boastful reply, he hardened his heart and resolved to wage war upon the Prophet and to offer him battle; wherefore he beat the messenger with a grievous beating and returned a foul answer to Solomon, threatening him and saying, \u2018Of a truth, thy soul hath suggested to thee a vain thing; dost thou menace me with mendacious words? But gird thyself for battle; for, an thou come not to me, I will assuredly come to thee.' So the messenger returned to Solomon and told him all that had passed and whatso had befallen him, which when the Prophet heard, he raged like Doomsday and addressed himself to the fray and levied armies of men and Jann and birds and reptiles. He commanded his Wazir Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jann, to gather together the Marids of the Jinn from all parts, and he collected for him six hundred thousand thousand of devils.[FN#123] Moreover, by his order, his Wazir \u00c1saf bin Barkhiy\u00e1 levied him an army of men, to the number of a thousand thousand or more. These all he furnished with arms and armour and mounting, with his host, upon his carpet, took flight through air, while the beasts fared under him and the birds flew overhead, till he lighted down on the island of the refractory King and encompassed it about, filling earth with his hosts.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit continued, \"So when Solomon the prophet (with whom be peace!) lighted down with his host on the island he sent to our King, saying, \u2018Behold, I am come: defend thy life against that which is fallen upon thee, or else make thy submission to me and confess my apostleship and give me thy daughter to lawful wife and break thine idol and worship the one God, the alone Worshipful; and testify, thou and thine, and say, \u2018There is no God but the God, and Solomon is the Apostle of Allah![FN#124] This if thou do, thou shalt have pardon and peace; but if not, it will avail thee nothing to fortify thyself in this island, for Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) hath bidden the wind obey me; so I will bid it bear me to thee on my carpet and make thee a warning and an example to deter others.' But the King made answer to his messenger, saying, \u2018It may not on any wise be as he requireth of me; so tell him I come forth to him,' With this reply the messenger returned to Solomon, who thereupon gathered together all the Jinn that were under his hand, to the number of a thousand thousand, and added to them other than they of Marids and Satans from the islands of the sea and the tops of the mountains and, drawing them up on parade, opened his armouries and distributed to them arms and armour. Then the Prophet drew out his host in battle array, dividing the beasts into two bodies, one on the right wing of the men and the other on the left, and bidding them tear the enemies' horses in sunder. Furthermore, he ordered the birds which were in the island to hover over their heads and, whenas the assault should be made, that they should swoop down and tear out the foe's eyes with their beaks and buffet their faces with their wings; and they answered, saying, \u2018We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O Prophet of Allah!' Then Solomon seated himself on a throne of alabaster, studded with precious stones and plated with red gold; and, commanding the wind to bear him aloft, set his Wazir Asaf bin Barkhiya[FN#125] and the kings of mankind on his right and his Wazir Al-Dimiryat and the kings of the Jinn on his left, arraying the beasts and vipers and serpents in the van. Thereupon they all set on us together, and we gave them battle two days over a vast plain; but, on the third day, disaster befel us, and the judgment of Allah the Most High was executed upon us. Now the first to charge upon them were I and my troops, and I said to my companions, \u2018Abide in your places, whilst I sally forth to them and provoke Al-Dimiryat to combat singular.' And behold, he came forth to the duello as he were a vast mountain, with his fires flaming and his smoke spireing, and shot at me a falling star of fire; but I swerved from it and it missed me. Then I cast at him in my turn, a flame of fire, and smote him; but his shaft[FN#126] overcame my fire and he cried out at me so terrible a cry that meseemed the skies were fallen flat upon me, and the mountains trembled at his voice. Then he commanded his hosts to charge; accordingly they rushed on us and we rushed on them, each crying out upon other, and battle reared its crest rising in volumes and smoke ascending in columns and hearts well nigh cleaving. The birds and the flying Jinn fought in the air and the beasts and men and the foot-faring Jann in the dust and I fought with Al- Dimiryat, till I was aweary and he not less so. At last, I grew weak and turned to flee from him, whereupon my companions and tribesmen likewise took to flight and my hosts were put to the rout, and Solomon cried out, saying, \u2018Take yonder furious tyrant, the accursed, the infamous!' Then man fell upon man and Jinn upon Jinn and the armies of the Prophet charged down upon us, with the wild beasts and lions on their right hand and on their left, rending our horses and tearing our men; whilst the birds hovered over-head in air pecking out our eyes with their claws and beaks and beating our faces with their wings, and the serpents struck us with their fangs, till the most of our folk lay prone upon the face of the earth, like the trunks of date-trees. Thus defeat befel our King and we became a spoil unto Solomon. As to me, I fled from before Al-Dimiryat, but he followed me three months' journey, till I fell down for weariness and he overtook me, and pouncing upon me, made me prisoner. Quoth I, \u2018By the virtue of Him who hath exalted thee and abased me, spare me and bring me into the presence of Solomon, on whom be peace!' So he carried me before Solomon, who received me after the foulest fashion and bade bring this pillar and hollow it out. Then he set me herein and chained me and sealed me with his signet-ring, and Al- Dimiryat bore me to this place wherein thou seest me. Moreover, he charged a great angel to guard me, and this pillar is my prison until Judgment-day.\" Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Jinni who was prisoned in the pillar had told them his tale, from first to last, the folk marvelled at his story and at the frightfulness of his favour, and the Emir Musa said, \"There is no God but the God! Soothly was Solomon gifted with a mighty dominion.\" Then said the Shaykh Abd al-Samad to the Jinni, \"Ho there! I would fain ask thee of a thing, whereof do thou inform us.\" \"Ask what thou wilt,\" answered the Ifrit Dahish and the Shaykh said, \"Are there hereabouts any of the Ifrits imprisoned in bottles of brass from the time of Solomon (on whom be peace!)?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Jinni; \"there be such in the sea of al-Karkar[FN#127] on the shores whereof dwell a people of the lineage of Noah (on whom be peace!); for their country was not reached by the Deluge and they are cut off there from the other sons of Adam.\" Quoth Abd al-Samad, \"And which is the way to the City of Brass and the place wherein are the cucurbites of Solomon, and what distance lieth between us and it?\" Quoth the Ifrit, \"It is near at hand,\" and directed them in the way thither. So they left him and fared forward till there appeared to them afar off a great blackness and therein two fires facing each other, and the Emir Musa asked the Shaykh, \"What is yonder vast blackness and its twin fires?\"; and the guide answered, \"Rejoice O Emir, for this is the City of Brass, as it is described in the Book of Hidden Treasures which I have by me. Its walls are of black stone and it hath two towers of Andalusian brass,[FN#128] which appear to the beholder in the distance as they were twin fires, and hence is it named the City of Brass.\" Then they fared on without ceasing till they drew near the city and behold, it was as it were a piece of a mountain or a mass of iron cast in a mould and impenetrable for the height of its walls and bulwarks; while nothing could be more beautiful than its buildings and its ordinance. So they dismounted down and sought for an entrance, but saw none neither found any trace of opening in the walls, albeit there were five-and-twenty portals to the city, but none of them was visible from without. Then quoth the Emir, \"O Shaykh, I see to this city no sign of any gate;\" and quoth he, \"O Emir, thus is it described in my Book of Hidden Treasures; it hath five-and-twenty portals; but none thereof may be opened save from within the city.\" Asked Musa, \" And how shall we do to enter the city and view its wonders?\" and Talib son of Sahl, his Wazir, answered, \"Allah assain the Emir! let us rest here two or three days and, God willing, we will make shift to come within the walls.\" Then said Musa to one of his men, \"Mount thy camel and ride round about the city, so haply thou may light upon a gate or a place somewhat lower than this fronting us, or Inshallah! a breach whereby we can enter.\" Accordingly he mounted his beast, taking water and victuals with him, and rode round the city two days and two nights, without drawing rein to rest, but found the wall thereof as it were one block, without breach or way of ingress; and on the third day, he came again in sight of his companions, dazed and amazed at what he had seen of the extent and loftiness of the place, and said, \"O Emir, the easiest place of access is this where you have alighted.\" Then Musa took Talib and Abd al-Samad and ascended the highest hill which overlooked the city. When they reached the top, they beheld beneath them a city, never saw eyes a greater or a goodlier, with dwelling-places and mansions of towering height, and palaces and pavilions and domes gleaming gloriously bright and sconces and bulwarks of strength infinite; and its streams were a-flowing and flowers a-blowing and fruits a glowing. It was a city with gates impregnable; but void and still, without a voice or a cheering inhabitant. The owl hooted in its quarters; the bird skimmed circling over its squares and the raven croaked in its great thoroughfares weeping and bewailing the dwellers who erst made it their dwelling.[FN#129] The Emir stood awhile, marvelling and sorrowing for the desolation of the city and saying, Glory to Him whom nor ages nor changes nor times can blight, Him who created all things of His Might!\" Presently, he chanced to look aside and caught sight of seven tablets of white marble afar off. So he drew near them and finding inscriptions graven thereon, called the Shaykh and bade him read these. Accordingly he came forward and, examining the inscriptions, found that they contained matter of admonition and warning and instances and restraint to those of understanding. On the first tablet was inscribed, in the ancient Greek character: \"O son of Adam, how heedless art thou of that which is before thee! Verily, thy years and months and days have diverted thee therefrom. Knowest thou not that the cup of death is filled for thy bane which in a little while to the dregs thou shalt drain? Look to thy doom ere thou enter thy tomb. Where be the Kings who held dominion over the lands and abased Allah's servants and built these palaces and had armies under their commands? By Allah, the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies and the Devastator of dwelling-places came down upon them and transported them from the spaciousness of their palaces to the staitness of their burial-places.\" And at the foot of the tablet were written the following verses,\n\n\"Where are the Kings earth-peopling, where are they? * The built\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and peopled left they e'er and aye!\nThey're tombed yet pledged to actions past away * And after death\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     upon them came decay.\nWhere are their troops? They failed to ward and guard! * Where\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     are the wealth and hoards in treasuries lay?\nTh' Empyrean's Lord surprised them with one word, * Nor wealth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     nor refuge could their doom delay!\"\n\nWhen the Emir heard this, he cried out and the tears ran down his cheeks and he exclaimed, \"By Allah, from the world abstaining is the wisest course and the sole assaining!\" And he called for pen- case and paper and wrote down what was graven on the first tablet. Then he drew near the second tablet and found these words graven thereon, \"O son of Adam, what hath seduced thee from the service of the Ancient of Days and made thee forget that one day thou must defray the debt of death? Wottest thou not that it is a transient dwelling wherein for none there is abiding; and yet thou taketh thought unto the world and cleaves\" fast thereto? Where be the kings who Irak peopled and the four quarters of the globe possessed? Where be they who abode in Ispahan and the land of Khorasan? The voice of the Summoner of Death summoned them and they answered him, and the Herald of Destruction hailed them and they replied, Here are we! Verily, that which they builded and fortified profited them naught; neither did what they had gathered and provided avail for their defence.\" And at the foot of the tablet were graven the following verses,\n\nWhere be the men who built and fortified * High places never man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     their like espied?\nIn fear of Fate they levied troops and hosts, * Availing naught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     when came the time and tide,\nWhere be the Kisr\u00e1s homed in strongest walls? * As though they\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ne'er had been from home they tried!\"\n\nThe Emir Musa wept and exclaimed, \"By Allah, we are indeed created for a grave matter!\" Then he copied the inscription and passed on to the third tablet,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Emir Musa passed on to the third tablet, whereon was written, \"O son of Adam, the things of this world thou lovest and prizest and the hest of thy Lord thou spurnest and despisest. All the days of thy life pass by and thou art content thus to aby. Make ready thy viaticum against the day appointed for thee to see and prepare to answer the Lord of every creature that be!\" And at the foot were written these verses,\n\n\"Where is the wight who peopled in the past * Hind land and Sind;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and there the tyrant played?\nWho Zanj[FN#130] and Habash bound beneath his yoke, * And Nubia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     curbed and low its puissance laid.\nLook not for news of what is in his grave. * Ah, he is far who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     can thy vision aid!\nThe stroke of death fell on him sharp and sure; * Nor saved him\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    palace, nor the lands he swayed.\"\n\nAt this Musa wept with sore weeping and, going on to the fourth tablet, he read inscribed thereon, \"O son of Adam, how long shall thy Lord bear with thee and thou every day sunken in the sea of thy folly? Hath it then been stablished unto thee that some day thou shalt not die? O son of Adam, let not the deceits of thy days and nights and times and hours delude thee with their delights; but remember that death lieth ready for thee ambushing, fain on thy shoulders to spring, nor doth a day pass but he morneth with thee in the morning and nighteth with thee by night. Beware, then, of his onslaught and make provision there-against. As was with me, so it is with thee; thou wastest thy whole life and squanderest the joys in which thy days are rife. Hearken, therefore, to my words and put thy trust in the Lord of Lords; for in the world there is no stability; it is but as a spider's web to thee.\" And at the foot of the tablet were written these couplets,\n\n\"Where is the man who did those labours ply * And based and built\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and reared these walls on high?\nWhere be the castles' lords? Who therein dwelt * Fared forth and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     left them in decay to lie.\nAll are entombed, in pledge against the day * When every sin\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     shall show to every eye.\nNone but the Lord Most High endurance hath, * Whose Might and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Majesty shall never die.\"\n\nWhen the Emir read this, he swooned away and presently coming to himself marvelled exceedingly and wrote it down. Then he drew near the fifth tablet and behold, thereon was graven, \"O son of Adam, what is it that distracteth thee from obedience of thy Creator and the Author of thy being, Him who reared thee whenas thou west a little one, and fed thee whenas thou west full-grown? Thou art ungrateful for His bounty, albeit He watcheth over thee with His favours, letting down the curtain of His protection over thee. Needs must there be for thee an hour bitterer than aloes and hotter than live coals. Provide thee, therefore, against it; for who shall sweeten its gall or quench its fires? Bethink thee who forewent thee of peoples and heroes and take warning by them, ere thou perish.\" And at the foot of the tablet were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Where be the Earth-kings who from where they \u2018bode, * Sped and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     to grave yards with their hoardings yode:\nErst on their mounting-days there hadst beheld * Hosts that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     concealed the ground whereon they rode:\nHow many a king they humbled in their day! * How many a host they\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     led and laid on load!\nBut from th' Empyrean's Lord in haste there came * One word, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     joy waxed grief ere morning glowed.\"\n\nThe Emir marvelled at this and wrote it down; after which he passed on to the sixth tablet and behold, was inscribed thereon, \"O son of Adam, think not that safety will endure for ever and aye, seeing that death is sealed to thy head alway. Where be thy fathers, where be thy brethren, where thy friends and dear ones? They have all gone to the dust of the tombs and presented themselves before the Glorious, the Forgiving, as if they had never eaten nor drunken, and they are a pledge for that which they have earned. So look to thyself, ere thy tomb come upon thee.\" And at the foot of the tablet were these couplets,\n\n\"Where be the Kings who ruled the Franks of old? * Where be the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     King who peopled Tingis-wold[FN#131]?\nTheir works are written in a book which He, * The One, th' All-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    father shall as witness hold.\"\n\nAt this the Emir Musa marvelled and wrote it down, saying, \"There is no god but the God! Indeed, how goodly were these folk!\" Then he went up to the seventh tablet and behold, thereon was written, \"Glory to Him who fore-ordaineth death to all He createth, the Living One, who dieth not! O son of Adam, let not thy days and their delights delude thee, neither thine hours and the delices of their time, and know that death to thee cometh and upon thy shoulder sitteth. Beware, then, of his assault and make ready for his onslaught. As it was with me, so it is with thee; thou wastest the sweet of thy life and the joyance of thine hours. Give ear, then, to my rede and put thy trust in the Lord of Lords and know that in the world is no stability, but it is as it were a spider's web to thee and all that is therein shall die and cease to be. Where is he who laid the foundation of Amid[FN#132] and builded it and builded F\u00e1rik\u00edn[FN#133] and exalted it? Where be the peoples of the strong places? Whenas them they had inhabited, after their might into the tombs they descended. They have been carried off by death and we shall in like manner be afflicted by doom. None abideth save Allah the Most High, for He is Allah the Forgiving One.\" The Emir Musa wept and copied all this, and indeed the world was belittled in his eyes. Then he descended the hill and rejoined his host, with whom he passed the rest of tile day, casting about for a means of access to the city. And he said to his Wazir Talib bin Sahl and to the chief officers about him, \"How shall we contrive to enter this city and view its marvels?: haply we shall find therein wherewithal to win the favour of the Commander of the Faithful.\" \"Allah prolong the Emir's fortune!\" replied Talib, \"let us make a ladder and mount the wall therewith, so peradventure we may come at the gate from within.\" Quoth the Emir, \"This is what occurred to my thought also, and admirable is the advice!\" Then he called for carpenters and blacksmiths and bade them fashion wood and build a ladder plated and banded with iron. So they made a strong ladder and many men wrought at it a whole month. Then all the company laid hold of it and set it up against the wall, and it reached the top as truly as if it had been built for it before that time. The Emir marvelled and said, \"The blessing of Allah be upon you. It seems as though ye had taken the measure of the mure, so excellent is your work.\" Then said he to his men, \"Which of you will mount the ladder and walk along the wall and cast about for a way of descending into the city, so to see how the case stands and let us know how we may open the gate?\" Whereupon quoth one of them, \"I will go up, O Emir, and descend and open to you\"; and Musa answered, saying, \"Go and the blessing of Allah go with thee!\" So the man mounted the ladder; but, when he came to the top of the wall, he stood up and gazed fixedly down into the city, then clapped his hands and crying out, at the top of his voice, \"By Allah, thou art fair!\" cast himself down into the place, and Musa cried, \"By Allah, he is a dead man!\" But another came up to him and said, \"O Emir, this was a madman and doubtless his madness got the better of him and destroyed him. I will go up and open the gate to you, if it be the will of Allah the Most High.\" \"Go up,\" replied Musa, \"and Allah be with thee! But beware lest thou lose thy head, even as did thy comrade.\" Then the man mounted the ladder, but no sooner had he reached the top of the wall than he laughed aloud, saying, \"Well done! well done!\"; and clapping palms cast himself down into the city and died forthright. When the Emir saw this, he said, \"An such be the action of a reasonable man, what is that of the madman? If all our men do on this wise, we shall have none left and shall fail of our errand and that of the Commander of the Faithful. Get ye ready for the march: verily we have no concern with this city.\" But a third one of the company said, \"Haply another may be steadier than they.\" So a third mounted the wall and a fourth and a fifth and all cried out and cast themselves down, even as did the first, nor did they leave to do thus, till a dozen had perished in like fashion. Then the Shaykh Abd al-Samad came forward and heartened himself and said, \"This affair is reserved to none other than myself; for the experienced is not like the inexperienced.\" Quoth the Emir, \"Indeed thou shalt not do that nor will I have thee go up: an thou perish, we shall all be cut off to the last man since thou art our guide.\" But he answered, saying, \"Peradventure, that which we seek may be accomplished at my hands, by the grace of God Most High!\" So the folk all agreed to let him mount the ladder, and he arose and heartening himself, said, \"In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!\" and mounted the ladder, calling on the name of the Lord and reciting the Verses of Safety.[FN#134] When he reached the top of the wall, he clapped his hands and gazed fixedly down into the city; whereupon the folk below cried out to him with one accord, saying \"O Shaykh Abd al-Samad, for the Lord's sake, cast not thyself down!\"; and they added, \"Verily we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! If the Shaykh fall, we are dead men one and all.\" Then he laughed beyond all measure and sat a long hour, reciting the names of Allah Almighty and repeating the Verses of Safety; then he rose arid cried out at the top of his voice, saying, O Emir, have no fear; no hurt shall betide you, for Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) hath averted from me the wiles and malice of Satan, by the blessing of the words, \u2018In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate!'\" Asked Musa, \"What didst thou see, O Shaykh?\"; and Abd al-Samad answered, \"I saw ten maidens, as they were Houris of Heaven calling to me with their hands\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh Abd al-Samad answered, \"I saw ten maidens like Houris of Heaven,[FN#135] and they calling and signing,[FN#136] \u2018Come hither to us'; and meseemed there was below me a lake of water. So I thought to throw myself down, when behold, I espied my twelve companions lying dead; so I restrained myself and recited somewhat of Allah's Book, whereupon He dispelled from me the damsels' witchlike wiles and malicious guiles and they disappeared. And doubtless this was an enchantment devised by the people of the city, to repel any who should seek to gaze upon or to enter the place. And it hath succeeded in slaying our companions.\" Then he walked on along the wall, till he came to the two towers of brass aforesaid and saw therein two gates of gold, without pad locks or visible means of opening. Hereat he paused as long as Allah pleased[FN#137] and gazed about him awhile, till he espied in the middle of one of the gates, a horseman of brass with hand outstretched as if pointing, and in his palm was somewhat written. So he went up to it and read these words, \"O thou who comest to this place, an thou wouldst enter turn the pin in my navel twelve times and the gate will open.\" Accordingly, he examined the horseman and finding in his navel a pin of gold, firm-set and fast fixed, he turned it twelve times, whereupon the horseman revolved like the blinding lightning and the gate swung open with a noise like thunder. He entered and found himself in a long passage,[FN#138] which brought him down some steps into a guard-room furnished with goodly wooden benches, whereon sat men dead, over whose heads hung fine shields and keen blades and bent bows and shafts ready notched. Thence, he came to the main gate of the city; and, finding it secured with iron bars and curiously wrought locks and bolts and chains and other fastenings of wood and metal, said to himself, \"Belike the keys are with yonder dead folk.\" So he turned back to the guard-room and seeing amongst the dead an old man seated upon a high wooden bench, who seemed the chiefest of them, said in his mind, \"Who knows but they are with this Shaykh? Doubtless he was the warder of the city and these others were under his hand.\" So he went up to him and lifting his gown, behold, the keys were hanging to his girdle; whereat he joyed with exceeding joy and was like to fly for gladness. Then he took them and going up to the portal, undid the padlocks and drew back the bolts and bars, whereupon the great leaves flew open with a crash like the pealing thunder by reason of its greatness and terribleness. At this he cried out saying, \"Allaho Akbar\u2014God is most great!\" And the folk without answered him with the same words, rejoicing and thanking him for his deed. The Emir Musa also was delighted at the Shaykh's safety and the opening of the city-gate, and the troops all pressed forward to enter; but Musa cried out to them, saying, \"O folk, if we all go in at once we shall not be safe from some ill-chance which may betide us. Let half enter and other half tarry without.\" So he pushed forwards with half his men, bearing their weapons of war, and finding their comrades lying dead, they buried them; and they saw the doorkeepers and eunuchs and chamberlains and officers reclining on couches of silk and all were corpses. Then they fared on till they came to the chief market-place, full of lofty buildings whereof none overpassed the others, and found all its shops open, with the scales hung out and the brazen vessels ordered and the caravanserais full of all manner goods; and they beheld the merchants sitting on the shop-boards dead, with shrivelled skin and rotted bones, a warning to those who can take warning; and here they saw four separate markets all replete with wealth. Then they left the great bazar and went on till they came to the silk market, where they found silks and brocades, orfrayed with red gold and diapered with white silver upon all manner of colours, and the owners lying dead upon mats of scented goats' leather, and looking as if they would speak; after which they traversed the market-street of pearls and rubies and other jewels and came to that of the schroffs and money-changers, whom they saw sitting dead upon carpets of raw silk and dyed stuffs in shops full of gold and silver. Thence they passed to the perfumers' bazar where they found the shops filled with drugs of all kinds and bladders of musk and ambergris and Nadd-scent and camphor and other perfumes, in vessels of ivory and ebony and Khalanj-wood and Andalusian copper, the which is equal in value to gold; and various kinds of rattan and Indian cane; but the shopkeepers all lay dead nor was there with them aught of food. And hard by this drug-market they came upon a palace, imposingly edified and magnificently decorated; so they entered and found therein banners displayed and drawn sword blades and strung bows and bucklers hanging by chains of gold and silver and helmets gilded with red gold. In the vestibules stood benches of ivory, plated with glittering gold and covered with silken stuffs, whereon lay men, whose skin had dried up on their bones; the fool had deemed them sleeping; but, for lack of food, they had perished and tasted the cup of death. Now when the Emir Musa saw this, he stood still, glorifying Allah the Most High and hallowing Him and contemplating the beauty of the palace and the massiveness of its masonry and fair perfection of its ordinance, for it was builded after the goodliest and stablest fashion and the most part of its adornment was of green[FN#139] lapis-lazuli, and on the inner door, which stood open, were written in characters of gold and ultramarine, these couplets,\n\n\"Consider thou, O man, what these places to thee showed * And be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    upon thy guard ere thou travel the same road:\nAnd prepare thee good provision some day may serve thy turn * For\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   each dweller in the house needs must yede wi' those who yode\nConsider how this people their palaces adorned * And in dust have\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    been pledged for the seed of acts they sowed\nThey built but their building availed them not, and hoards * Nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    saved their lives nor day of Destiny forslowed:\nHow often did they hope for what things were undecreed. * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    passed unto their tombs before Hope the bounty showed\nAnd from high and awful state all a sudden they were sent * To\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   the straitness of the grave and oh! base is their abode:\nThen came to them a Crier after burial and cried, * What booted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    thrones or crowns or the gold to you bestowed:\nWhere now are gone the faces hid by curtain and by veil, * Whose\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    charms were told in proverbs, those beauties \u00e0-la-mode?\nThe tombs aloud reply to the questioners and cry, * \u2018Death's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     canker and decay those rosy cheeks corrode'\nLong time they ate and drank, but their joyaunce had a term, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     And the eater eke was eaten, and was eaten by the worm.\"\n\nWhen the Emir read this, he wept, till he was like to swoon away- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred ante Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Emir wept till he was like to swoon away, and bade write down the verses, after which he passed on into the inner palace and came to a vast hall, at each of whose four corners stood a pavilion lofty and spacious, washed with gold and silver and painted in various colours. In the heart of the hall was a great jetting- fountain of alabaster, surmounted by a canopy of brocade, and in each pavilion was a sitting-place and each place had its richly- wrought fountain and tank paved with marble and streams flowing in channels along the floor and meeting in a great and grand cistern of many-coloured marbles. Quoth the Emir to the Shaykh Abd al-Samad, \"Come let us visit yonder pavilion!\" So they entered the first and found it full of gold and silver and pearls and jacinths and other precious stones and metals, besides chests filled with brocades, red and yellow and white. Then they repaired to the second pavilion, and, opening a closet there, found it full of arms and armour, such as gilded helmets and Davidean[FN#140] hauberks and Hindi swords and Arabian spears and Chorasmian[FN#141] maces and other gear of fight and fray. Thence they passed to the third pavilion, wherein they saw closets padlocked and covered with curtains wrought with all manner of embroidery. They opened one of these and found it full of weapons curiously adorned with open work and with gold and silver damascene and jewels. Then they entered the fourth pavilion, and opening one of the closets there, beheld in it great store of eating and drinking vessels of gold and silver, with platters of crystal and goblets set with fine pearls and cups of carnelian and so forth. So they all fell to taking that which suited their tastes and each of the soldiers carried off what he could. When they left the pavilions, they saw in the midst of the palace a door of teak-wood marquetried with ivory and ebony and plated with glittering gold, over which hung a silken curtain purfled with all manner of embroideries; and on this door were locks of white silver, that opened by artifice without a key. The Shaykh Abd al-Samad went valiantly up thereto and by the aid of his knowledge and skill opened the locks, whereupon the door admitted them into a corridor paved with marble and hung with veil- like[FN#142] tapestries embroidered with figures of all manner beasts and birds, whose bodies were of red gold and white silver and their eyes of pearls and rubies, amazing all who looked upon them. Passing onwards they came to a saloon builded all of polished marble, inlaid with jewels, which seemed to the beholder as though the floor were flowing water[FN#143] and whoso walked thereon slipped. The Emir bade the Shaykh strew somewhat upon it, that they might walk over it; which being done, they made shift to fare forwards till they came to a great domed pavilion of stone, gilded with red gold and crowned with a cupola of alabaster, about which were set lattice-windows carved and jewelled with rods of emerald,[FN#144] beyond the competence of any King. Under this dome was a canopy of brocede, reposing upon pillars of red gold and wrought with figures of birds whose feet were of smaragd, and beneath each bird was a network of fresh- hued pearls. The canopy was spread above a jetting fountain of ivory and carnelian, plated with glittering gold and thereby stood a couch set with pearls and rubies and other jewels and beside the couch a pillar of gold. On the capital of the column stood a bird fashioned of red rubies and holding in his bill a pearl which shone like a star; and on the couch lay a damsel, as she were the lucident sun, eyes never saw a fairer. She wore a tight-fitting body-robe of fine pearls, with a crown of red gold on her head, filleted with gems, and on her forehead were two great jewels, whose light was as the light of the sun. On her breast she wore a jewelled amulet, filled with musk and ambergris and worth the empire of the Caesars; and around her neck hung a collar of rubies and great pearls, hollowed and filled with odoriferous musk And it seemed as if she gazed on them to the right and to the left.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel seemed to be gazing at the folk to the right and to the left. The Emir Musa marvelled at her exceeding beauty and was confounded at the blackness of her hair and the redness of her cheeks, which made the beholder deem her alive and not dead, and said to her, \"Peace be with thee, O damsel!\" But Talib ibn Sahl said to him, \"Allah preserve thee, O Emir, verily this damsel is dead and there is no life in her; so how shall she return thy salam?\" adding, \u2018 Indeed, she is but a corpse embalmed with exceeding art; her eyes were taken out after her death and quicksilver set under them, after which they were restored to their sockets. Wherefore they glisten and when the air moveth the lashes, she seemeth to wink and it appeareth to the beholder as though she looked at him, for all she is dead.\" At this the Emir marvelled beyond measure and said, \"Glory be to God who subjugateth His creatures to the dominion of Death!\" Now the couch on which the damsel lay, had steps, and thereon stood two statues of Andalusian copper representing slaves, one white and the other black. The first held a mace of steel[FN#145] and the second a sword of watered steel which dazzled the eye; and between them, on one of the steps of the couch, lay a golden tablet, whereon were written, in characters of white silver, the following words: \"In the name of God, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Praise be to Allah, the Creator of mankind; and He is the Lord of Lords, the Causer of Causes! In the name of Allah, the Never beginning, the Everlasting, the Ordainer of Fate and Fortune! O son of Adam! what hath befooled thee in this long esperance? What hath unminded thee of the Death-day's mischance? Knowest thou not that Death calleth for thee and hasteneth to seize upon the soul of thee? Be ready, therefore, for the way and provide thee for thy departure from the world; for, assuredly, thou shalt leave it without delay. Where is Adam, first of humanity? Where is Noah with his progeny? Where be the Kings of Hind and Irak-plain and they who over earth's widest regions reign? Where do the Amalekites abide and the giants and tyrants of olden tide? Indeed, the dwelling-places are void of them and they have departed from kindred and home. Where be the Kings of Arab and Ajam? They are dead, all of them, and gone and are become rotten bones. Where be the lords so high in stead? They are all done dead. Where are Kora and Haman? Where is Shaddad son of Ad? Where be Canaan and Zu\u2018l-Autad,[FN#146] Lord of the Stakes? By Allah, the Reaper of lives hath reaped them and made void the lands of them. Did they provide them against the Day of Resurrection or make ready to answer the Lord of men? O thou, if thou know me not, I will acquaint thee with my name: I am Tadmurah,[FN#147] daughter of the Kings of the Amalekites, of those who held dominion over the lands in equity and brought low the necks of humanity. I possessed that which never King possessed and was righteous in my rule and did justice among my lieges; yea, I gave gifts and largesse and freed bondsmen and bondswomen. Thus lived I many years in all ease and delight of life, till Death knocked at my door and to me and to my folk befel calamities galore; and it was on this wise. There betided us seven successive years of drought, wherein no drop of rain fell on us from the skies and no green thing sprouted for us on the face of earth.[FN#148] So we ate what was with us of victual, then we fell upon the cattle and devoured them, until nothing was left. Thereupon I let bring my treasures and meted them with measures and sent out trusty men to buy food. They circuited all the lands in quest thereof and left no city unsought, but found it not to be bought and returned to us with the treasure after a long absence; and gave us to know that they could not succeed in bartering fine pearls for poor wheat, bushel for bushel, weight for weight. So, when we despaired of succour, we displayed all our riches and things of price and, shutting the gates of the city and its strong places, resigned ourselves to the deme of our Lord and committed our case to our King. Then we all died,[FN#149] as thou seest us, and left what we had builded and all we had hoarded. This, then, is our story, and after the substance naught abideth but the trace.\" Then they looked at the foot of the tablet and read these couplets,\n\n\"O child of Adam, let not hope make mock and flyte at thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Prom all thy hands have treasur\u00e9d, remov\u00e9d thou shalt be;\nI see thou covetest the world and fleeting worldly charms, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     races past and gone have done the same as thou I see.\nLawful and lawless wealth they got; but all their hoarded store,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * Their term accomplished, naught delayed of Destiny's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     decree.\nArmies they led and puissant men and gained them gold galore; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Then left their wealth and palaces by Pate compelled to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     flee,\nTo straitness of the grave-yard and humble bed of dust * Whence,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     pledged for every word and deed, they never more win free:\nAs a company of travellers had unloaded in the night * At house\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     that lacketh food nor is o'erfain of company:\nWhose owner saith, \u2018O folk, there be no lodging here for you;' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     So packed they who had erst unpacked and far\u00e9d hurriedly:\nMisliking much the march, nor the journey nor the halt * Had\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     aught of pleasant chances or had aught of goodly greet\nThen prepare thou good provision for to-morrow's journey stored,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * Naught but righteous honest life shall avail thee with the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Lord!\"\n\nAnd the Emir Musa wept as he read, \"By Allah, the fear of the Lord is the best of all property, the pillar of certainty and the sole sure stay. Verily, Death is the truth manifest and the sure behest, and therein, O thou, is the goal and return place evident. Take warning, therefore, by those who to the dust did wend and hastened on the way of the predestined end. Seest thou not that hoary hairs summon thee to the tomb and that the whiteness of thy locks maketh moan of thy doom? Wherefore be thou on the wake ready for thy departure and thine account to make. O son of Adam, what hath hardened thy heart in mode abhorred? What hath seduced thee from the service of thy Lord? Where be the peoples of old time? They are a warning to whoso will be warned! Where be the Kings of al-S\u00edn and the lords of majestic mien? Where is Shaddad bin Ad and whatso he built and he stablished? Where is Nimrod who revolted against Allah and defied Him? Where is Pharaoh who rebelled against God and denied Him? Death followed hard upon the trail of them all, and laid them low sparing neither great nor small, male nor female; and the Reaper of Mankind cut them off, yea, by Him who maketh night to return upon day! Know, O thou who comest to this place, that she whom thou seest here was not deluded by the world and its frail delights, for it is faithless, perfidious, a house of ruin, vain and treacherous; and salutary to the creature is the remembrance of his sins; wherefore she feared her Lord and made fair her dealings and provided herself with provaunt against the appointed marching day. Whoso cometh to our city and Allah vouchsafeth him competence to enter it, let him take of the treasure all he can, but touch not aught that is on my body, for it is the covering of my shame[FN#150] and the outfit for the last journey; wherefore let him fear Allah and despoil naught thereof; else will he destroy his own self. This have I set forth to him for a warning from me and a solemn trust to be; wherewith, peace be with ye and I pray Allah to keep you from sickness and calamity.\" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Emir Musa read this, he wept with exceeding weeping till he swooned away and presently coming to himself, wrote down all he had seen and was admonished by all he had witnessed. Then he said to his men, \"Fetch the camels and load them with these treasures and vases and jewels.\" \"O Emir,\" asked Talib, \"shall we leave our damsel with what is upon her, things which have no equal and whose like is not to be found and more perfect than aught else thou takest; nor couldst thou find a goodlier offering wherewithal to propitiate the favour of the Commander of the Faithful?\" But Musa answered, \"O man, heardest thou not what the Lady saith on this tablet? More by token that she giveth it in trust to us who are no traitors.\" \"And shall we,\" rejoined the Wazir Talib, \"because of these words, leave all these riches and jewels, seeing that she is dead? What should she do with these that are the adornments of the world and the ornament of the worldling, seeing that one garment of cotton would suffice for her covering? We have more right to them than she.\" So saying he mounted the steps of the couch between the pillars, but when he came within reach of the two slaves, lo! the mace-bearer smote him on the back and the other struck him with the sword he held in his hand and lopped off his head, and he dropped down dead. Quoth the Emir, \"Allah have no mercy on thy resting-place! Indeed there was enough in these treasures, and greed of gain assuredly degradeth a man.\" Then he bade admit the troops; so they entered and loaded the camels with those treasures and precious ores; after which they went forth and the Emir commanded them to shut the gate as before. They fared on along the sea-shore a whole month, till they came in sight of a high mountain overlooking the sea and full of caves, wherein dwelt a tribe of blacks, clad in hides, with burnooses also of hide and speaking an unknown tongue. When they saw the troops they were startled like shying steeds and fled into the caverns, whilst their women and children stood at the cave doors, looking on the strangers. \"O Shaykh Abd al-Samad,\" asked the Emir, \"what are these folk?\" and he answered, \"They are those whom we seek for the Commander of the Faithful.\" So they dismounted and setting down their loads, pitched their tents; whereupon, almost before they had done, down came the King of the blacks from the mountain and drew near the camp. Now he understood the Arabic tongue; so, when he came to the Emir he saluted him with the salam and Musa returned his greeting and entreated him with honour. Then quoth he to the Emir, \"Are ye men or Jinn?\" \"Well, we are men,\" quoth Musa; \"but doubtless ye are Jinn, to judge by your dwelling apart in this mountain which is cut off from mankind, and by your inordinate bulk.\" \"Nay,\" rejoined the black; \"we also are children of Adam, of the lineage of Ham, son of Noah (with whom be peace!), and this sea is known as Al-Karkar.\" Asked Musa, \"O King, what is your religion and what worship ye?\"; and he answered, saying, \"We worship the God of the heavens and our religion is that of Mohammed, whom Allah bless and preserve!\" \"And how came ye by the knowledge of this,\" questioned the Emir, \"seeing that no prophet was inspired to visit this country?\" \"Know, Emir,\" replied the King, \"that there appeared to us whilere from out the sea a man, from whom issued a light that illumined the horizons and he cried out, in a voice which was heard of men far and near, saying, \u2018O children of Ham, reverence to Him who seeth and is not seen and say ye, \u2018There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is the messenger of God!' And he added, \u2018I am Abu al-Abb\u00e1s al-Khizr.' Before this we were wont to worship one another, but he summoned us to the service of the Lord of all creatures; and he taught us to repeat these words, \u2018There is no god save the God alone, who hath for partner none, and His is the kingdom and His is the praise. He giveth life and death and He over all things is Almighty.' Nor do we draw near unto Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) except with these words, for we know none other; but every eve before Friday[FN#151] we see a light upon the face of earth and we hear a voice saying, \u2018Holy and glorious, Lord of the Angels and the Spirit! What He willeth is, and what He willeth not, is not. Every boon is of His grace and there is neither Majesty nor is there Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!' But ye,\" quoth the King, \"who and what are ye and what bringeth you to this land?\" Quoth Musa, \"We are officers of the Sovereign of Al-Islam, the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al- Malik bin Marwan, who hath heard tell of the lord Solomon, son of David (on whom be peace!) and of that which the Most High bestowed upon him of supreme dominion; how he held sway over Jinn and beast and bird and was wont when he was wroth with one of the Marids, to shut him in a cucurbite of brass and, stopping its mouth on him with lead, whereon he impressed his seal ring, to cast him into the sea of Al-Karkar. Now we have heard tell that this sea is nigh your land; so the Commander of the Faithful hath sent us hither, to bring him some of these cucurbites, that he may look thereon and solace himself with their sight. Such, then, is our case and what we seek of thee, O King, and we desire that thou further us in the accomplishment of our errand commanded by the Commander of the Faithful.\" \"With love and gladness,\" replied the black King, and carrying them to the guest house, entreated them with the utmost honour and furnished them with all they needed, feeding them upon fish. They abode thus three days, when he bade his divers fetch from out the sea some of the vessels of Solomon. So they dived and brought up twelve cucurbites, whereat the Emir and the Shaykh and all the company rejoiced in the accomplishment of the Caliph's need. Then Musa gave the King of the blacks many and great gifts; and he, in turn, made him a present Of the wonders of the deep, being fishes in human form,[FN#152] saying \"Your entertainment these three days hath been of the meat of these fish.\" Quoth the Emir, \"Needs must we carry some of these to the Caliph, for the sight of them will please him more than the cucurbites of Solomon.\" Then they took leave of the black King and, setting out on their homeward journey, travelled till they came to Damascus, where Musa went in to the Commander of the Faithful and told him all that he had sighted and heard of verses and legends and instances, together with the manner of the death of Talib bin Sahl; and the Caliph said, \"Would I had been with you, that I might have seen what you saw!\" Then he took the brazen vessels and opened them, cucurbite after cucurbite, whereupon the devils came forth of them, saying, \"We repent, O Prophet of Allah! Never again will we return to the like of this thing; no never!\" And the Caliph marvelled at this. As for the daughters of the deep presented to them by the black King, they made them cisterns of planks, full of water, and laid them therein; but they died of the great heat. Then the Caliph sent for the spoils of the Brazen City and divided them among the Faithful,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Five Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph marvelled much at the cucurbites and their contents; then he sent for the spoils and divided them among the Faithful, saying, \"Never gave Allah unto any the like of that which he bestowed upon Solomon David-son!\" Thereupon the Emir Musa sought leave of him to appoint his son Governor of the Province in his stead, that he might be take himself to the Holy City of Jerusalem, there to worship Allah. So the Commander of the Faithful invested his son Harun with the government and Musa repaired to the Glorious and Holy City, where he died. This, then, is all that hath come down to us of the story of the City of Brass, and God is All-knowing! Now (continued Shahrazad) I have another tale to tell anent the\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#104] This is a true \"City of Brass.\" (Nuh\u00e1s asfar=yellow copper), as we learn in Night dcclxxii. It is situated in the \"Maghrib\" (Mauritania), the region of magic and mystery; and the idea was probably suggested by the grand Roman ruins which rise abruptly from what has become a sandy waste. Compare with this tale \"The City of Brass\" (Night cclxxii.). In Egypt Nuh\u00e1s is vulg. pronounced Nih\u00e1s.\n\n[FN#105] The Bresl. Edit. adds that the seal-ring was of stamped stone and iron, copper and lead. I have borrowed copiously from its vol. vi. pp. 343, et seq.\n\n[FN#106] As this was a well-known pre-Islamitic bard, his appearance here is decidedly anachronistic, probably by intention.\n\n[FN#107] The first Moslem conqueror of Spain whose lieutenant,\nT\u00e1rik, the gallant and unfortunate, named Gibraltar (Jabal al-\nTarik).\n[FN#108] The colours of the Ban\u00fa Umayyah (Ommiade) Caliphs were white, of the Ban\u00fa Abb\u00e1s (Abbasides) black, and of the Fatimites green. Carrying the royal flag denoted the generalissimo or plenipotentiary.\n\n[FN#109] i.e. Old Cairo, or Fustat: the present Cairo was then a Coptic village founded on an old Egyptian settlement called Lui- Tkeshroma, to which belonged the tanks on the hill and the great well, Bir Yusuf, absurdly attributed to Joseph the Patriarch. Lui is evidently the origin of Levi and means a high priest (Brugsh ii. 130) and his son's name was Roma.\n\n[FN#110] I cannot but suspect that this is a clerical error for \"Al-Samanh\u00fadi,\" a native of Samanh\u00fad (Wilkinson's \"Semenood\") in the Delta on the Damietta branch, the old Sebennytus (in Coptic Jem-nuti=Jem the God), a town which has produced many distinguished men in Moslem times. But there is also a Samh\u00fad lying a few miles down stream from Denderah and, as its mounds prove, it is an ancient site.\n\n[FN#111] Egypt had not then been conquered from the Christians.\n\n[FN#112] Arab. \"K\u00edz\u00e1n fukk\u00e1'a,\" i.e. thin and slightly porous earthenware jars used for Fukk\u00e1'a, a fermented drink, made of barley or raisins.\n\n[FN#113] I retain this venerable blunder: the right form is\nSam\u00fam, from Samm, the poison-wind.\n[FN#114] i.e. for worship and to prepare for futurity.\n\n[FN#115] The camel carries the Badawi's corpse to the cemetery which is often distant: hence to dream of a camel is an omen of death.\n\n[FN#116] Koran xxiv 39. The word \"Sar\u00e1b\" (mirage) is found in Isaiah (xxxv. 7) where the passage should be rendered \"And the mirage (sharab) shall become a lake\" (not, \"and the parched ground shall become a pool\"). The Hindus prettily call it \"Mrigatrishn\u00e1\" = the thirst of the deer.\n\n[FN#117] A name of Allah.\n\n[FN#118] Arab. \"Kint\u00e1r\"=a hundredweight (i.e. 100 Ibs.), about 98 3/4 Ibs. avoir. Hence the French quintal and its congeners (Littr\u00e9).\n\n[FN#119] i.e. \"from Sh\u00e1m (Syria) to (the land of) Adnan,\" ancestor of the Naturalized Arabs that is, to Arabia.\n\n[FN#120] Koran lii. 21. \"Every man is given in pledge for that which he shall have wrought.\"\n\n[FN#121] There is a constant clerical confusion in the texts between \"Arar\" (Juniperus Oxycedrus used by the Breeks for the images of their gods) and \"Marmar\" marble or alabaster, in the Talmud \"Marmora\" = marble. evidently from {\u200bGreek letters}\u200b = brilliant, the brilliant stone.\n\n[FN#122] These Ifritical names are chosed for their bizarrerie. \"Al-D\u00e1hish\" = the Amazed; and \"Al-A'amash\" = one with weak eyes always watering.\n\n[FN#123] The Arabs have no word for million; so Messer Marco Miglione could not have learned it from them. On the other hand the Hindus have more quadrillions than modern Europe.\n\n[FN#124] This formula, according to Moslems, would begin with the beginning \"There is no il\u00e1h but Allah and Adam is the Apostle (ras\u00fal = one sent, a messenger, not nab\u00ed = prophet) of Allah.\" And so on with Noah, Moses, David (not Solomon as a rule) and Jesus, to Mohammed.\n\n[FN#125] This son of Barachia has been noticed before. The text embroiders the Koranic chapter No. xxvii.\n\n[FN#126] The Bresl. Edit. (vi. 371) reads \"Samm-hu\"=his poison, prob. a clerical error for \"Sahmhu\"=his shaft. It was a duel with the \"Shih\u00e1b\" or falling stars, the meteors which are popularly supposed, I have said, to be the arrows shot by the angels against devils and evil spirits when they approach too near Heaven in order to overhear divine secrets.\n\n[FN#127] A fancy sea from the Lat. \"Carcer\" ( ?).\n\n[FN#128] Andalusian = Spanish, the Vandal-land, a term accepted by the Moslem invader.\n\n[FN#129] This fine description will remind the traveller of the old Haurani towns deserted since the sixth century, which a silly writer miscalled the \"Giant Cities of Bashan.\" I have never seen anything weirder than a moonlight night in one of these strong places whose masonry is perfect as when first built, the snowy light pouring on the jet-black basalt and the breeze sighing and the jackal wailing in the desert around.\n\n[FN#130] \"Zanj,\" I have said, is the Arab. form of the Persian \"Zang-bar\" (=Black-land), our Zanzibar. Those who would know more of the etymology will consult my \"Zanzibar,\" etc., chaps. i.\n\n[FN#131] Arab. \"Tanjah\"=Strabo {\u200bGreek letters}\u200b (derivation uncertain), Tingitania, Tangiers. But why the terminal s ?\n\n[FN#132] Or Amidah, by the Turks called \"Kara (black) Amid\" from the colour of the stones and the Arabs \"Diyar-bakr\" (Diarbekir), a name which they also give to the whole province\u2014Mesopotamia.\n\n[FN#133] Mayy\u00e1f\u00e1rik\u00edn, an episcopal city in Diyar-bakr: the natives are called F\u00e1rik\u00ed; hence the abbreviation in the text.\n\n[FN#134] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t al-Naj\u00e1t,\" certain Koranic verses which act as talismans, such as, \"And wherefore should we not put our trust in Allah ?\" (xiv. 15); \"Say thou, \u2018Naught shall befall us save what Allah hath decreed for us,' \" (ix. 51), and sundry others.\n\n[FN#135] These were the \"Brides of the Treasure,\" alluded to in the story of Hasan of Bassorah and elsewhere.\n\n[FN#136] Arab. \"Ish\u00e1rah,\" which may also mean beckoning. Easterns reverse our process: we wave hand or finger towards ourselves; they towards the object; and our fashion represents to them, Go away!\n\n[FN#137] i.e. musing a long time and a longsome.\n\n[FN#138] Arab. \"Dihl\u00edz\" from the Persian. This is the long dark passage which leads to the inner or main gate of an Eastern city, and which is built up before a siege. It is usually furnished with Mastabah-benches of wood and masonry, and forms a favourite lounge in hot weather. Hence Lot and Moses sat and stood in the gate, and here man speaks with his enemies.\n\n[FN#139] The names of colours are as loosely used by the Arabs as by the Classics of Europe; for instance, a light grey is called a \"blue or a green horse.\" Much nonsense has been written upon the colours in Homer by men who imagine that the semi-civilised determine tints as we do. They see them but they do not name them, having no occasion for the words. As I have noticed, however, the Arabs have a complete terminology for the varieties of horse-hues. In our day we have witnessed the birth of colours, named by the dozen, because required by women's dress.\n\n[FN#140] For David's miracles of metallurgy see vol. i. 286.\n\n[FN#141] Arab. \"Khw\u00e1razm,\" the land of the Chorasmioi, who are mentioned by Herodotus (iii. 93) and a host of classical geographers. They place it in Sogdiana (hod. Sughd) and it corresponds with the Khiva country.\n\n[FN#142] Arab. \"Burka',\" usually applied to a woman's face-veil and hence to the covering of the Ka'abah, which is the \"Bride of Meccah.\"\n\n[FN#143] Alluding to the trick played upon Bilk\u00eds by Solomon who had heard that her legs were hairy like those of an ass: he laid down a pavement of glass over flowing water in which fish were swimming and thus she raised her skirts as she approached him and he saw that the report was true. Hence, as I have said, the depilatory.\n\n[FN#144] I understand the curiously carved windows cut in arabesque-work of marble. (India) or basalt (the Haur\u00e1n) and provided with small panes of glass set in emeralds where tin would be used by the vulgar.\n\n[FN#145] Arab. \"Bul\u00e1d\" from the Pers. \"Pul\u00e1d.\" Hence the name of the famous Druze family \"Jumblat,\" a corruption of \"J\u00e1n- pul\u00e1d\"=Life o' Steel.\n\n[FN#146] Pharaoh, so called in Koran (xxxviii. 11) because he tortured men by fastening them to four stakes driven into the ground. Sale translates \"the contriver of the stakes\" and adds, \"Some understand the word figuratively, of the firm establishment of Pharaoh's kingdom, because the Arabs fix their tents with stakes; but they may possibly intend that prince's obstinacy and hardness of heart.\" I may note that in \"Tasawwuf,\" or Moslem Gnosticism, Pharaoh represents, like Prometheus and Job, the typical creature who upholds his own dignity and rights in presence and despight of the Creator. S\u00e1hib the S\u00faf\u00ed declares that the secret of man's soul (i.e. its emanation) was first revealed when Pharaoh declared himself god; and Al-Ghaz\u00e1l\u00ed sees in his claim the most noble aspiration to the divine, innate in the human spirit. (Dabistan, vol. iii.)\n\n[FN#147] In the Calc. Edit. \"Tarmuz, son of the daughter,\" etc.\nAccording to the Arabs Tadmur (Palmyra) was built by Queen\nTadmurah, daughter of Hass\u00e1n bin Uzaynah.\n[FN#148] It is only by some such drought that I can account for the survival of those marvellous Haurani cities in the great valley S. E. of Damascus.\n\n[FN#149] So Moses described his own death and burial.\n\n[FN#150] A man's \"aurat\" (shame) extends from the navel (included) to his knees, a woman's from the top of the head to the tips of her toes. I have before noticed the Hindostan\u00ed application of the word.\n\n[FN#151] Arab. \"Jum'ah\" ( = the assembly) so called because the General Resurrection will take place on that day and it witnessed the creation of Adam. Both these reasons are evidently after- thoughts; as the Jews received a divine order to keep Saturday, and the Christians, at their own sweet will, transferred the weekly rest-day to Sunday, wherefore the Moslem preferred Friday. Sabbatarianism, however, is unknown to Al-Islam and business is interrupted, by Koranic order ([xii. 9-10), only during congregational prayers in the Mosque. The most a Mohammedan does is not to work or travel till after public service. But the Moslem hardly wants a \"day of rest;\" whereas a Christian, especially in the desperately dull routine of daily life and toil, without a gleam of light to break the darkness of his civilised and most unhappy existence, disctinctly requires it.\n\n[FN#152] Mankind, which sees itself everywhere and in everything, must create its own analogues in all the elements, air (Sylphs), fire (Jinns), water (Mermen and Mermaids) and earth (Kobolds), These merwomen were of course seals or manatees, as the wild women of Hanno were gorillas.", "http://genius.com/Richard-f-burton-arabian-nights-vol-6-chap-2-annotated"], "368124": ["Famous Football Fans by\u00a0Sports\u00a0Genius Football (Ft.\u00a0Sports\u00a0Genius)", "Famous Football Fans Lyrics\n\nBarclays Premier LeagueAFC BournemouthJamie Reynolds\nPyrion Flax\nSeth Rogen\nArsenal FCAinsley Harriot | Alan Davies | Alex Brooker | Alfie Allen | Anatol Yusef | Andrew Lincoln | Andy Murray | Angel | Anna Popplewell | Anne Keothavong\nBarbara Windsor MBE | Baron Davis | Bashy | Benedict Cumberbatch | Bonnie Wright | Bruce Forsyth CBE\nC4 | Carl Barat of The Jackals | Carmelo Anthony * | Charity Wakefield | Chip | Chris Christie [*] | Clemency Burton-Hill\nDan Stevens | Daniel Sharman | Danny Brown | Dara \u00d3 Briain | David Schneider | Dermot O'Leary | Dido | Dirk Nowitzki | DJ Target | Dominic Cooper\nElla Eyre\nFuture\nGhetts\nIan Poulter | Idris Elba\nJack Whitehall | James DeGale | Jamie Bell | Jay Z | Jazzie B | JB | Jonathan Rhys Meyers | Josh Franceschi of You Me at Six | Jordan Stephens of Rizzle Kicks | Judge Jules\nKaya Scodelario | Keanu Reeves | Kevin Costner | KSI\nLethal Bizzle | Leona Lewis | Lewis Hamilton | Lily Loveless | Locksmyth | Louise Brealey\nMark Strong | Martin Kemp | Matt Damon | Matt Lucas | Max Helyer of You Me at Six | Meek Mill | Mick Jagger | Milton Jones | Mo Farah CBE | Monty Panesar\nNick Dunning | Nick Hornby | Nicola Adams\nOsama Bin Laden\nPatsy Palmer | Pepper | Pete Ellard of Scouting for Girls | Pete Tong | Phil Tufnell | Philip Glenister | Piers Morgan | Prince Harry | Prince Rapid\nQueen Elizabeth II\nRavi Bopara | Reggie Yates | Rizzle Kicks | Robert Pattinson | Roger Daltrey | Romesh Ranganathan | Rupert Graves\nSarah-Jane Crawford | Scott Robinson | Sean 'Diddy' Combs | Sir Ian McKellen | Skandar Keynes | Spike Lee | Susie Dent | Sway\nTamzin Outhwaite | Tyga\nUlisses\nWill Poulter | Wretch 32\nYoung O | Young Thug\nZac Efron | Zawe Ashton\nAston Villa FCArthur Darvill\nDavid Bradley | David Cameron\nIan Bell\nNigel Kennedy\nOliver Phelps\nPrince William\nTom Hanks\nChelsea FCAlice Eve\nBen Ainslie\nCallum Turner | Cara Delevingne | Charlize Theron | Chemmy Alcott\nDamon Albarn | Dan Rothman of London Grammar | Danny Cipriani | Danny John-Jules | Darren Barker | David Baddiel | David Walliams | Dermot Morgan | Dominic Major of London Grammar\nEd Sheeran | Ed Westwick | Ellie Goulding | Emma Watson\nGeorge Ford | George Groves | Gordon Ramsay | Gustav Wood of Young Guns | Guy Ritchie\nHeather Watson\nJack Fox | Jason Statham | Jeremy Clarkson | Jonny Lee Miller | Justin Bieber\nKate Hudson | Keeley Hawes | Kevin Pietersen | Kevin Garnett\nLara Stone | Laura Robson | Lil Wayne\nLily Allen | Louise Hazel | Luke Pasqualino\nMark Hoppus | Mark Ronson | Martine McCutcheon | Marvin Humes\nNatalie Dormer | Natalie Pinkham | Neil Robertson | Nick Pickard | Nigella Lawson\nOmid Djalili\nPaul Oakenfold | Phil Daniels\nRaquel Welch [*]\nSam Matterface | Sean Lock | Sebastian Coe | Sienna Miller | Sir Richard Attenborough | Sir Steve Redgrave | Shorty\nTim Lovejoy | Trevor Eve | Tubes\nWill Ferrell\nCrystal Palace FCBill Nighy | Bill Wyman\nDoc Brown\nEddie Izzard\nJamie Blackley\nLiam Neeson\nMartyn Rooney\nRafe Spall | Rebecca Lowe | Roy Hudd | Rupert Penry-Jones\nTimothy Spall\nEverton FCAmanda Holden\nChris Foy\nDame Judi Dench\nFandango [I] [II] [III]\nIan Hart\nMatt Damon | Mike Lewis\nNas\nSir Paul McCartney MBE | Sylvester Stallone\nTony Bellew\nLeicester City FCGary Lineker\nJohn Leguizamo\nNigel Pearson\nSam Bailey | Serge Pizzorno of Kasabian\nTom Meighan of Kasabian\nLiverpool FCAdam Woodyatt | Alex Rosamilia of The Gaslight Anthem | Andy Brown of Lawson | Angelina Jolie\nBilly Bob Thornton | Brad Pitt | Brandon Flowers | Brandon McCarthy\nCaroline Wozniacki | Chris de Burgh | Clive Owen | Coleen Rooney | Curtly Ambrose\nDaniel Craig | David Gyasi | David Morrissey | Dave Gorman | Dr. Dre\nElvis Costello\nFrisco\nGary Barlow\nIain Stirling\nJason Isaacs | John Bishop | Julian Ovenden | John Oliver\nKim Cattrall | Kirsty Gallacher\nLana Del Rey | LeBron James | Liam Neeson\nMark Prendergast of Kodaline | Mel C | Mike Myers\nNelson Mandela\nRebecca Ferguson | Robert Carlyle\nSamuel L.
