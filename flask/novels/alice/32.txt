Five Feet High And Rising Lyrics

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

[Verse 1]
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

[Verse 2]
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleeping
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

[Verse 3]
Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is coming, it's going to take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
4 feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

[Verse 4]
Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We got to head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and rising
