Rabbit With Fangs Lyrics

I got a cold man and he's dead in a jar
I got a sick killer and he's dead in a jar
He kills mothers and he looks like a cross
Between K. Cobain and William Wilson
Just want you to listen, Just one slave
Just one smile, Just one rabbit, Just
Gonna say to you
If you touch me I'll kill you (2X)
Coz I am the White Rabbit
If you touch me
I'll kill you (3X)
I got a hiarstylist and he knows he's the
One
I got a hairstylist and he knows he got it
Wrong
He kills mothers and he looks like a cross
Between K. Cobain and William Wilson
I just want you to listen, Just one slave
Just one smile, Just one rabbit, Just
Gonna say to you, yeah
If you touch me I'll kill you (2X)
Coz I am the White Rabbit
If you touch me
I'll kill you (3X)
