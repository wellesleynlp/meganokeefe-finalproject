20,000 Feet Lyrics

If there's one thing I love
It's flying high above
Breaking through the barrier of sound
It's just like making love
When you're up above
Riding in my bird of silver steel

[Chorus]
Forget the time
Ten miles high
Living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet

It's the rushing of my blood
That makes me feel so good
I can see the world below just shooting by
Twice the speed of sound
That's how I like to ride
My chariot of steel across the sky

[Chorus]
If it's faster than light
Sharper than steel
I'll race across the ceiling of the world
Just like a gun
Aiming at the sun
Riding in my bird of silver steel

[Chorus]
I'm floating in space
The world seems to disappear
Then I awake
Got to get my head back in place
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet
