At Long Last Love Lyrics

Is it an earthquake
Or simply a shock?
Is it
The good turtle soup
Or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail
This feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel
The real McCoy?

Is it for all time
Or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see
Or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy
Not worth thinking of?
Or is it
At long last love?

Is it an earthquake
Or simply a shock?
Is it
The good turtle soup
Or is it
Merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail
This feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel
The real McCoy?

Is it for all time
Or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see
Or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy
Not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long
Long, long last love?
