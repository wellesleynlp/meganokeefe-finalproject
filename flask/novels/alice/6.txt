At Long Last Love Lyrics

I'm so in love and though it gives me joy intense
I can't decipher if I'm a lifer or if it's just a first offense
I'm so in love, I've no sense of values left at all
Is this a playtime affair of May-time or is it a windfall?

Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinkin' of?
Or is it at long last love?

Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feelin' of joy?
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth dreamin' of?
Or is it at long last love?
