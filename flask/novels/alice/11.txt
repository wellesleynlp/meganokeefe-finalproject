Rabbit Hole Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Morning Mrs. Johnson
Oh my God you raised a good one
I’m the teacher, he’s my student
And I’m giving him straight a’s

Chemistry, biology
As long as he’s on top of me
The class room or the bathroom
We gonna practice till we graduate

[Pre-Chorus] [x2]
We’re the kids your momma warned you about
We’re the kids your momma warned you about
Drive fast, roll tight, ride hard all night

[Chorus]
‘Cause I eat boys like a cannibal
Fuck hard, howl at the moon like an animal
Eat me, drink me, straight down the rabbit hole
White lines, white lies, straight down the rabbit hole

When I fall in love, I fall down the rabbit hole
Down the rabbit hole, down the rabbit hole
When I fall in love, I fall down the rabbit hole
Down the rabbit hole, down the rabbit hole

Follow me down the rabbit hole

[Verse 2]
Counting pounds and counting dollars
Mama married to a mobster
My old man is in the lock up
And he’s counting down the days

Drinking all the liquor
Lighting up behind the bleachers
Getting dirty in detention
We’re gonna do it anyway

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We’re gonna fuck like rabbits
Like rabbits, like rabbits, like rabbits
We’re gonna fuck like rabbits
Like rabbits, like rabbits, like rabbits

Wild child kiss me baby, drive me crazy, drive me wild
Wild child kiss me baby, touch it, touch it, drive me wild
Wild child kiss me baby, drive me crazy, drive me wild
Wild child kiss me baby, touch it, touch it, drive me wild

[Chorus]
