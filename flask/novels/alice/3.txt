At Long Last Love Lyrics

Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it that good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it the cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel, the real Mccoy?
Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?
Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it that fine turtle soup or is it merely the mock?
Is it the whisky, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel the real Mccoy?
Is it for all time or is it simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long, is this at long, is it at long last love?
