Long Gone Lyrics

[Chorus] (x2)
Paper planes flying out of sight
Kaleidoscope in black and white
Paralyzed by what you do
Indecision catch 22
Another life, another time
Another superficial state of mind
I lose myself and lose control
I'm falling down the rabbit hole
And I'm long gone
And I'm long gone

(Paper planes)
(Out of sight)
(Another time)
(State of mind)
And I'm long gone
