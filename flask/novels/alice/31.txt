Tweaker Kidz Lyrics

Verse 1)
I strut, I strut, I strut to the left
I see these high school kidz trying to sniff Dreft
I work, I move, I shake it to the right
They're all fired up and they're looking to fight, so I said

Hey man, look around, take a shot, and smoke some dope
Hey man, look around and smoke some dope
And maybe then you will be good to go

Verse 2)
The kids are not alright I mean LOOK AT THEM!
They limp around thinking that they're elephants
They'd do just about anything to get their fix
But they'd be best in the clinic, instead of the kitchen cuz I said

Hey man, look around, take a shot, and smoke some dope
Hey man, look around and smoke some dope
And maybe then you will be good to go

Verse 3)
Going through his daddy's medicine cabinet
Instead he grabs Viagra that he thought was Xanax
The kid takes five and then he goes to the mall
Then he told his friends how bad he wanted to fuck them all
So I said

Hey man, look around, take a shot, and smoke some dope
Hey man, look around and smoke some dope
And maybe then you will be good to go
