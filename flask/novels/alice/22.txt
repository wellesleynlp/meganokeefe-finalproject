Jack Boots And Leather Caps Lyrics

MARCH
Marching through the country
Leather shining bright
The battle units are ready
They're heading for the fight
People become as timid as a hare
When they see them marching by
This night there will be no mercy
Tonight you're gonna die

CHORUS
Jackboots and leather caps
You'll be trampled down by boots
Jackboots and leather caps
Stand up and salute

ATTACK
The soldiers are in a bad state of temper
You'd better go abroad
Or else they cut your throat or smash your skull
Watch out
To stay in this country is one big error
They'll show you by the sword
Tonight's the night of terror
This night you're gonna die

[repeat Chorus]
[SOLO]

[repeat Chorus]
Rise!
Stand up and salute
