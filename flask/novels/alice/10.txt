Feed My Fuckin' Habit Lyrics

All those pills, they make you uptight
I'm suprised you still walk upright
You want to live the thug life
Well!
Dance on the edge of my knife
Whoa!

Feed my fuckin' habit
Feed my fuckin' habit
Follow the white rabbit
Follow the white rabbit
Reach into me and grab it
Reach into me and grab it
Feed my fuckin' habit
Feed my fuckin' habit

On a pale, moonlight night
My
Willpower loses its fight
Ooh

Feed my fuckin' habit
Feed my fuckin' habit
Follow the white rabbit
Follow the white rabbit
Reach into me and grab it
Reach into me and grab it
Feed my fuckin' rabbit
Feed my fuckin' rabbit
