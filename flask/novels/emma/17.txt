Hares On The Mountain Lyrics

Young women they run like hares on the mountain
And if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting

Young women they sing like birds in the bushes
If I was a young man I'd go beat them bushes

Young women they swim like ducks in the water
If I was a young man I'd soon go swim after

Young women they run like hares on the mountain
And if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting
