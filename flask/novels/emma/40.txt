Emma-Lee Lyrics

Oh x8

If the world stops turning or my legs stop working
Then I'll still feel alright
If the photos fading or my memory keeps erasing
Then I'll still feel alright

Cause it's strong, and it has taking me over, over
I am lost and I need to be found

I'm lost in Emma-Lee, oh
I really like it, but I'm losing control
Emma-Lee, I'm scared
I kinda like it cause I feel right at home
Oh, Emma-Lee

Oh x8

If there was World War III, only reruns on TV
Then I would still feel alright
And If my boss fired me or my cat ran up a tree
Then I would still feel alright

Cause it's strong, and it has taking me over, over
I am lost and I need to be found

I'm lost in Emma-Lee, oh
I really like it, but I'm losing control
Emma-Lee, I'm scared
I kinda like it cause I feel right at home
Oh, Emma-Lee

Sticks and stones
Won't break my bones

Cause it's strong, and it has taking me over, over
I am lost and I need to be found

I'm lost in Emma-Lee, oh
I really like it, but I'm losing control
Emma-lee, I'm scared
I kinda like it cause I feel right at home
Oh, Emma-Lee, oh

I really like it, but I'm losing control
Emma-lee, I'm scared
I kinda like it cause I feel right at home
Emma-Lee

Oh x8

Emma-Lee

Oh x24
