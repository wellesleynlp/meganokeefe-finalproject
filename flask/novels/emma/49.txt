Designer Behavior Lyrics

Don't wanna talk about it
Don't wanna read about it
Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna see about it

Something's funny about a medical physician
Me lying on my back is his favorite position
Designer behavior with paxil, and valium
Even you can stomach prozac and lithium

Remember "Ozzie And Harriet"?
Remember "The Stepford Wives"?
Remember "Father Knows Best"?
Remember "I Love Lucy"?

A product of design
Back to the drawing board
Gotta be insane to fit in
If not you'll be ignored
You take apart my brain
But you couldn't make the pieces fit
Then give me happy pills
There's pieces left you idiot
