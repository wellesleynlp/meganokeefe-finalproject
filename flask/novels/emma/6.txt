Young Abe Lincoln Lyrics

YOUNG ABE LINCOLN

Well he lived in a cabin way down by the creek
He ran through the dust in his bare feet
But they didn't know that one fine day
That he would rule this U.S.A
And be the best leader in all the land

Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man
Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man

He walked many miles to school every day
And no kind of weather could keep him away
A learnin' to read and a learnin' to write
He whipped many men in a wrestlin' fight
He whipped many of â€˜em with just one hand

Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man
Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man

Now he was admitted to the lawyer's bar
People seeked his help from near and far
Ha could talk a country mile in an old court room
Make a man laugh whose life was doomed
He out talked Douglas or fancy Dan

Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man
Yes Young Abe Lincoln make a tall tall man

We had a big war while he was President
Finally won with the U.S. Grant
He heard both sides of the battle of rights
He hated to see those soldiers die
He hated to fight his own south land

Yes Young Abe Lincoln made a tall tall man
Yes Young Abe Lincoln made a tall tall man
