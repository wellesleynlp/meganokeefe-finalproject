LONE SURVIVOR
Written by Peter Berg
Based on the book by Marcus Luttrell
"NEVER OUT OF THE FIGHT"
-Navy SEAL Creed
1 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN 1 Through massive sun flare, a BLACKHAWK Chopper coming in
fast. Landing hard on Bagram Air Base.
LUTTRELL (vo)
It’s something most of us have known all of our lives. What we all wanted. It’s in our blood.
A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
There’s a storm inside of us. I’ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river. A drive.
2 INT. OPERATING ROOM 2
Clothes cut. Blood soaked Dog Tags cut. “Luttrell” in UA boxer shorts, IVs and fresh blood bags. Multiple Gunshots. Chunk of an ear missing. Heartbeat monitor. Weak pulse.
LUTTRELL (vo)
An unrelenting desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone could think possible.
Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl. Tears streaming down cheeks, a hand scrawled map on a left thigh, focused eyes of surgeons. Admirals’ pace in the hallway.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
Pushing ourselves into those dark cold corners where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight.
Heart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out. Heart monitor getting weaker.
Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell. Tight on HEART MONITOR: FLATLINE
LUTTRELL CONT’D
We wanted that fight at the highest
volume. The loud fight. The loudest, coldest, hottest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights.
Pushing in on the flatline. Alarm screaming. Tight on Luttrell’s eyes starting to glaze over. Dying.
BLACK.

Rugged and punishing. Endless and infinite. Steep stone mountains. Bottomless valleys. Cold and dry.
As we fly across this stunning land, from the bottom of the FRAME, ENTER:
A SPECIAL FORCE AIR INSERT TEAM.
FOUR HELICOPTERS. Two MH-47s transport. Two security Apaches.
3A IN THE CHOPPER: 3A
TIGHT ON MARCUS LUTTRELL. Healthy and very clear eyed.
12 SEALs fully dressed for combat. Sitting side by side. Clearly ready for war.

6 INT. THE CHOPPER - DUSK
Luttrell checks his map against his wrist strapped GPS.
Whistles quietly to himself.
LUTTRELL
I don’t see anything but steep. I
could be wrong. Hope I’m wrong. If it’s anything but steep I’m not seeing it.
DIETZ
Just put your feet where I put my
feet. All day long. You’re gonna love it.

SHANE PATTON plugged into an iPod. SLIPKNOT pounding into his head. He quietly sings along.
Kristensen leans over to Axelson, the navigator, adjusts his upper right strap on his front pack.
KRISTENSEN
I’m real interested in the pitch.
If it ain’t fucking glorious, come back, try another route. Don’t waste your time trying to cross something that’s gonna knock the shit out of us.
AXE Roger that.
Kristensen moves over to MIKE MURPHY.
KRISTENSEN
She does not need a Arabic horse.
MURPHY
How do you know about that?
KRISTENSEN
I know everything Murphy.
MURPHY Check.
KRISTENSEN
Morab Tennessee Walking Horse cross
stallion.
What?
MURPHY
3.
KRISTENSEN
Original Silver. Lone Ranger’s
Horse.
MURPHY Really?
KRISTENSEN
Tennessee cross stallion. That’s a
fucking horse.
MURPHY Yes sir.
KRISTENSEN
Lone Ranger’s horse of choice.
MURPHY Sounds excellent sir.
KRISTENSEN Glorious horse Murphy.
Tight on Luttrell starring into the plunging sun.
7 EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.
35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.
3A.
￼
LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.
NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.
Shah’s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.
A very worthy opponent.
RIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.
They are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.
Shah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.
Where is he?
SHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?
The women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.
A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.
GULAB GULAB
Please, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes
mushkil no ghowaro
Taraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.
SHAH
Have you spoken with the
Americans?
AFGHAN MAN Please! No!
SHAH
Aya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan! Na!
Gulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.
You lie! Please!
TARAQ
AFGHAN MAN
TARAQ
Ta Dorogh wayee!
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan!
4.
He’s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man’s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he’s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.
Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.
Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.
Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.
Shah backlit. Ignoring the man’s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.
Tight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand. BLACK
GRAPHIC: BAGRAM AIR BASE - 14 HOURS EARLIER
CUT TO:
8 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE - DAWN 8 Sun just beginning to rise over the Base.
Beautiful.
Camera moves though the sleeping base. Guards man posts. Aircraft static on runways in Hangars’. Tent after tent soldiers’ sleep.
We come to a small base within a base. 10 foot rebar framed dirt walls. Barbed wire. Heavy Iron gate.
A fortress within a fortress.
Graphic.
8A SEAL TEAM 10 CAMP OUELLETTE, BAGRAM AIR BASE - SUNRISE 8A
We move inside the SEAL compound. Several plywood buildings. Assorted trucks, Jeeps, heavy ATVs.
9 INT. SEAL BUNK ROOMS 9
Marcus Luttrell sleeps. Peaceful. Tight shots. Luttrell’s room. A Texas flag. Family pictures. Mom, Dad, twin Brother Morgan. SEAL Trident. Wanted poster Osama bin Laden. Guns, knifes, grenades.
5.
DANNY DIETZ sleeps. His walls covered with his art. Demons and Dragons and Serpents. Beautiful and haunting. Pictures of his wife, Patsy. His dogs. His parents.
Matt Axelson sleeps. Curly red hair. Pictures of his family. American flag. Freddie Couples walking the bridge at St. Andrews. Map of Afghanistan.
MIKE MURPHY
Rooms a mess. Clothes and gear everywhere. Grenades on a desk next to a copy of GATES OF FIRE. New York Rangers flag next to a SEAL Flag, 8 x 10 head shot of Ron Burgundy.
Tight on Murphy. His eyes slowly open. Hold a moment. Murphy checks watch. 0500. Slow and smooth Murphy rises. Body strong. Not ripped. Effortless power.
Murphy goes to his computer. Opens it and checks his mail. Tight on Murphy’s inbox.
A picture of an Arabian Horse. Murphy studies the picture.
9A MOVING DOWN HALLWAY 9A Murphy now in shorts and a Navy T-shirt. Holding his laptop,
eating a banana. Stops by Luttrell’s door. Opens it. Luttrell sleeps, Murphy sits on his bed. Nudges Luttrell.
Luttrell opens an eye. He’s staring at the computer pic of an Arabian horse.
MURPHY Is this doable?
LUTTRELL Expensive.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
Arabic. She’s got good taste.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
I’ll find out. Expensive.
Murphy is up. Heads out the door. Moves into the hallway. Opens Dietz’s door.
6.
MURPHY (quiet)
Danny. Dietz. Eyes closed.
DIETZ I’m up.
10 INT. GYM - CAMP OUELLETTE 10
Dark, then lights on, revealing a decent cross fit style gym.
Blackboard filled with the current workout leaders. Dietz and Murphy hold most of them.
The two men start to stretch in silence. Luttrell wanders in. A giant bowl of cereal.
LUTTRELL
Since when does she want an Arabic
horse?
MURPHY
Since I got an email this morning.
Probably saw it on Oprah.
LUTTRELL
Oprah rides Arabic horses?
MURPHY
I don’t know what Oprah does.
LUTTRELL She can afford them.
MURPHY
Why? How much do they cost?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know. Oprah money.
Fuck.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL
I thought you guys were doing this
tomorrow.
Murphy and Dietz strap on Body Armor.
7.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Maybe I’m starting to become tele
fucking pathic - non-verbal yoda or something. I could swear I just said outloud, that I thought this was happening tomorrow.
Murphy stretching.
MURPHY
I think Red Wings a go. Tonight.
LUTTRELL
Outstanding. SHANE PATTON wanders in.
SHANE PATTON You’re doing it now?
The three men ignore Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (to Luttrell)
They’re going at it now?
LUTTRELL Looks that way.
11 INT. MATT AXELSON’S BUNK - MORNING 11 Axe sleeps. His computer alarm goes off. Incoming voice chat. Slowly Axe reaches down for the computer on his floor.
Axe opens the computer. Signs in.
Incoming from his wife Cindy. “Are you up?”
Axe types.
“Yes my love.”
Cindy.
“What you doing?”
Axe stares at a picture of he and Cindy.
Oh.
(beat)
8.
“Looking at you.”
CINDY How do I look?
AXE Like Heaven.
12 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MORNING 12 Dietz and Murphy both warmed up clearly ready for some kind
of competition.
Luttrell sits on a weight bench. Takes off his watch. Dietz and Murphy under pull up bars. HEALY enters.
HEALY
Thought you guys were doing this
tomorrow...
MURPHY Ready?
Yup.
DIETZ
LUTTRELL Mark. Set. Go.
Luttrell hits the stop watch.
Murphy and Dietz leap to bars, 75 Pull-ups as fast as possible. Brief pauses to recover. 100 push ups. Dietz slightly ahead of Murphy. Sprints out of the gym. Murphy close behind.
The two men charge up and over the gate. Body Armor on.
13 EXT. BAGRAM - MONTAGE - MORNING 13 Murphy and Dietz running hard racing each other on a two mile
lap of the Air Base. Luttrell keeps time.
Shane starts bench pressing. Luttrell eats cereal.
13A AXE in bunk room. On the computer with Cindy. 13A
9.
“I won’t be able to talk for a couple of days.” “Gotta go to work?”
9A.
“Got to pay the bills.”
Murphy and Dietz sprinting. Dead even. Past Marines. Down a runway full of active aircraft and helicopters.
14 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14 Shane benching big. Luttrell munches cereal. Healy doing
pushups.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
HEALY No idea
LUTTRELL I don’t know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If I say I don’t know. I don’t
know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If you go you’ll go. If you don’t
go, trust me you will go. Eventually. Comprende?
SHANE PATTON So, I’m not going?
LUTTRELL I didn’t say that.
SHANE PATTON
You said if you don’t go, you will
eventually go.
LUTTRELL
Yea, that’s not saying your not
going.
SHANE PATTON I’m not going.
Shane back to bench pressing. Luttrell checks his watch, heads out towards the gate.
10.
14A INT / EXT WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14A
Other SEALs starting to gather. JAMES SUH, DAN HEALY, MIKE MCGREEVY, JAQUES FONTAN, JEFF LUCAS and JEFF TAYLOR
10A.
Dietz and Murphy balls out sprinting. Murphy has him by a few feet coming back to Ouellette iron wall. Murphy throws open the gate, runs inside.
Dietz a second behind. Luttrell looks at his watch.
LUTTRELL Murphy by 1.1.
Exhausted Dietz and Murphy sit in the dirt.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Head shave?
DIETZ Fuck.
Axe walks up, shorts and flip flops.
AXE Who won?
LUTTRELL Murphy. Barely.
AXE Head shave?
Dietz looks pained.
MURPHY
Man...I got to think this one out.
If I shave his head, I’m going to have to look at him. Really look at him. Ears, face, funny shaped head...I don’t know. Marcus? What do you think?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know boss...I don’t want to
be looking at him that close either, but he has been running his mouth about beating you...a lot. Head shave is fair.
Axe?
MURPHY
11.
AXE
Hell yea, I say shave him, and he
can’t eat with us, make him eat with E3 Marines until it grows back. Shave the boy.
MURPHY Shane?
SHANE PATTON
Well, I could go both ways on this.
He did lose but, he was close and you’re Mike Murphy and I would have expected a much bigger separation. Plus, we’re at war and there’s the whole Samson thing, so I’m not sure. I’ll plead the fifth on this one.
Murphy looks stares at Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) But you’re the boss, boss. So I’m
with you. I’ll shave his head, wax his balls if you give me the order. Sir, I’ll wax my own balls if you take me on Red Wings.
Murphy shakes his head at Patton, looks over to Dietz.
DANNY Come on Mike.
MURPHY
Yea Danny this is probably not
gonna go your way. Shane, get my razor.
SHANE PATTON Getting razor, copy that.
Erik Kristensen, officer in charge, from the deck of the Command Room.
Shane stops. Turns around.
KRISTENSEN Not today.
The SEALs stare up at their boss.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) Red Wing’s a go. Today. 1800.
12.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
KRISTENSEN (ignoring Shane)
PLO in one hour.
Sir?
SHANE PATTON
Kristensen dead eyes Patton. Turns and heads back into TOC. Healy follows
AXE Shane’s going?
MURPHY I don’t think so.
They all walk inside.
SHANE Maybe.
15 INT. RED WINGS PLO (PATROL LEADER’S ORDER) 15
Thirty SEALs plus support packed into the TOC (Tactical Operational Command). Makeshift control center. PowerPoint on flat screen. Operation REDWING is dissected.
MURPHY
Operation Red Wings. The target is
Ahmad Shah and his, we are estimating ten men, “loyal amigos”. Including, this dude,
Slide shifts to a color photo of “Taraq”.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Only have a first name, Taraq.
Seems to do most of the chief shit for Shah.
SEALs study photos.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We’re going in with a four man team. The recon team is Dietz, Comms. Axe, Nav. Luttrell, Medic.
HEALY
Objective of this mission is to positively identify Ahmad Shah.
Shane’s head in his hands, pissed he is not going...a grainy photo of Ahmad Shah on a large color monitor. PowerPoint.
13.
KRISTENSEN
This is the best picture we have of him. It’s current.
(MORE)
13A.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) We know Shah killed fourteen
Marines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.
Clear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.
The SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.
AXE
Go back...freeze.
Axe studies an image of Shah.
AXE (CONT’D) No earlobes.
MURPHY What’s that?
AXE
The guys got no earlobes.
Silence as the team studies the image.
SHANE
earlobes for anyway?
DIETZ
and balance.
SHANE
DIETZ
I heard earlobes are key for head
balance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he’s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...
LUTTRELL
False. Earlobes have no biological
functions for humans. Fish can use earlobes like a valve to open or close the ear canal.
What are Piercing Balance.
14.
SHANE
Why would a fish want to let water
into his ear canal?
Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”
14A.
Murphy keeps things moving.
MURPHY
Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.
AXE
The helo pilots are going to do two
false inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I’m estimating it’s gonna take us about two hours to complete.
MURPHY Luttrell - medical
LUTTRELL
First things first, win the fight.
There’s no medicine in a gunfight. It’s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.
Dietz stands up, starts talking comms
DIETZ
Crypto will be wide band, segment 2-
4. Murph’s got a SAT phone. Region is very steep so expect typical comms problems. We’ll be on two hour comms windows.
(MORE)
15.
DIETZ (CONT'D)
If we miss two windows I’d say wake somebody up. Other than that, don’t
sweat it.
Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.
MURPHY AC-130 is with us?
15A.
Dietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.
DIETZ
Correct. Just for the infil. All
comms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she’s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we’re halfway through infil, it’ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.
Danny chucks the toy plane.
MURPHY
Reaction Force is the following:
The 47’s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.
Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.
KRISTENSEN
That’s correct. You’ll have fifteen
team guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we’re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we’re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.
The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) The movement is so we can get the
47’s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.
MURPHY Roger that.
Luttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.
16.
JAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
AXE Lotta moving parts.
MURPHY
What we do, when we do, what we do.
KRISTENSEN
We go in four hours. I’m pulling up
tomorrow’s new guy presentation to 1800 tonight so that all may revel and partake.
SHANE PATTON Are you serious?
KRISTENSEN
Yes. Glorious evening gentlemen.
15A OMIT 15A
15B OMIT 15B
16 EXT. BAGRAM

The four bearded. contrast Marines.
SEALs moving through the massive base. Long hair, Surfers with handguns stuck in waistbands. Sharp
to the hundreds of uniformed buzz-cutted Rangers and
They move at us, holding trays loaded with food.
17 EXT. OULLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - CAMO CANOPY 17 LAST SUPPER.
Murphy, Luttrell, Axe and Dietz. Eating. Having a fly catch and kill competition.
DIETZ looks stressed.
He’s got a paint tile sample page on the table in front of him. Studying paint samples.
DIETZ
We were gonna wait but she’s all
into it and when she gets her head into something, that’s it. There’s no stopping her.
17.
MURPHY
So just let her do it. It’s good
for her. You got a handy man woman. That’s good.
17A.
MURPHY kills a fly. Places the dead fly by his coffee cup next to three other dead flies.
DIETZ I don’t know.
MURPHY Don’t know what?
DIETZ I don’t know.
What?
MURPHY
AXE
He’s worried that he’s losing
control over his castle.
MURPHY Really.
AXE Ask him.
MURPHY
Are you worried that you’re losing
control over your castle?
DIETZ Shut up Murph.
MURPHY Are you?
LUTTRELL
He’s having control issues cause
he’s the one whose always made the “taste” issues in the family.
DIETZ
She’s got great taste. I trust her.
MURPHY
So what’s the problem?
DIETZ
It’s not a problem. It’s just very
ongoing. Know what I mean?
Luttrell kills a fly. He’s got six dead ones. He and Murphy are competing.
18.
MURPHY
Not really. No. Marcus, you know
what he means? LUTTRELL
Control issues.
MURPHY Is that right?
DIETZ LUTTRELL DIETZ
No.
Yes.
It’s not control issues.
MURPHY What is it?
DIETZ
New grass leads to new bushes by
the window, leads to new windows, leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa, leads to new rug, leads to new floor...
MURPHY Got it.
LUTTRELL
Loss of control. Got to let that
go bro.
DIETZ
It’s like this weird journey that
she’s on. Moving through the house one room to the next.
AXE Where is she now?
DIETZ Kitchen. I think.
Murphy and Luttrell both kill flies at the same time. Marines with Buzz cuts in crisp uniform eating all around the SEALs. Stark contrast.
19.
CUT TO:
18 INT. SEAL TV ROOM 18
Tight on Shane Patton. Doing his best Napoleon Dynamite dance. He is not good. SEALs in lounge chairs. They watch, laugh and taunt. Music loud. Shane powers through. Finishes strong.
Whistles and clapping from the SEALs. AXE stands up. Puts an arm around Patton.
HEALY God was that awful
AXE
Ok, here’s the deal. That sucked,
but I’m voting that we move him forward cause I can’t watch this shit without puking anymore so I say lest be done with it. All in favor?
Luttrell and all SEALs put their hands up, except Murphy.
AXE (CONT’D) Come on Mikey.
MURPHY Can he say it?
Other SEALs agree. Shouting out. Debating whether Shane can “say it”. Making bets.
AXE knows what Murphy is thinking. Pauses. Looks at Shane.
AXE (quiet to Shane)
Can you say it?
SHANE PATTON I think so.
AXE Think so?
SHANE PATTON I can say it.
20.
AXE
Ok. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. He
can say it. Shut up.
The room silences. Patton, nervous, takes a deep breath.
SHANE PATTON (weak, then strong)
I’ve been around the world twice, talked to everyone once. I’ve seen two whales fuck, been to three world fairs, and I even know a man in Thailand with a wooden cock. I’ve pushed more peter, more sweeter, and more completer than any other peter-pusher around.
Tight on the SEALs smiling, some mouthing the words along with Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
I am a hard-bodied, hairy-chested,
rootin, tootin, shootin, parachutin, demolition double cap crimping Frogman.
19 INT. CAMP OUELLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - READY ROOM 19 The entire SEAL TEAM jocks up. Gets ready.
SHANE PATTON (vo)
There ain’t nothing I can’t do. No sky too high, no sea too rough, no Muff too tough. I’ve learned a lot of lessons in my life. Never shoot a large caliber man with a small caliber bullet.
FLASH BURST IMAGES of all relevant equip, men being prepped. M4s, night vision goggles, hand guns, knives, scopes checked. Under Armor, PowerBars, water bottles, grenades, extra ammo, radio’s prepped, extra batteries, Laptops.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (vo)
I drive all kinds of trucks. 2x’s, 4x’s, 6x’s even those big mother fuckers that bend and go TSSHITT TSSHITT when you step on the brakes.

SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.
DIETZ checking his radio equipment.
AXE going over his infil map.
LUTTRELL double checking all medical supplies.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (vo)
I’m a lover, I’m a fighter, I’m a UDT/SEAL Diver. I’ll wine, dine, intertwine and then sneak out the back door when the refueling is done.
MURPHY watching all of it.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) If your feeling froggy than you
better jump because this Frogman has been there, done that and is going back for more.
20 EXT. CHOPPER PAD BAGRAM 20
Sun setting over the Afghan desert. Thirty SEALs laying on the deck on their gear. Chilling out waiting for the 47’s. The guys laying around. Danny studies a piece of paper with color tile samples printed on it.
MURPHY
Seems to me like you’ve got to
straighten this shit out. DANNY
There’s nothing to straighten out.
AXE
If there’s nothing to straighten,
why are you fighting?
DANNY We’re not fighting?
AXE
Well, what is it that you’re doing?
DANNY
We’re more like disagreeing.
22.
AXE Disagreeing or arguing?
DANNY
Probably more like mildly arguing.
Just because you’re Mr. Perfect marriage, don’t be judging us mortal marriages who occasionally have mild disagreements, sometimes even loving arguments.
MURPHY
It’s a fucking stupid loving
argument.
DANNY
It’s not an argument.
LUTTRELL
It is an argument. Sounded like a couple of bighorn rams smashing skulls.
DANNY
What the fuck is everyone listening
to my shit for?
LUTTRELL Bro, you’re loud.
DANNY
You’re louder than I am.
LUTTRELL
Just pick some tile and move the
fuck on.
DANNY
I picked the tile. She doesn’t like
it.
LUTTRELL
What does she fucking like?
DANNY (reading from paper)
“Rose Honey Dew”
LUTTRELL Say what bro?
DANNY
She likes rose honey
dew...something.
23.
LUTTRELL
Are you fucking kidding me?
DANNY That’s what she likes.
LUTTRELL
You gotta control that situation.
AXE
Rose tiles in the kitchen?
DANNY
Can we talk about something else?
AXE
Yea let’s talk about what she’s
gonna tile your bathroom in. DANNY
I don’t wanna talk about that.
MURPHY
(Ron Burgandy impersonation)
Danny? I’m gonna put it out there, if you like it, you can take it, if you don’t, send it right back.
Dietz stares at Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL I wanna be on you.
MURPHY (pointing at Dietz)
On you.
Dietz smiles. Axe huge smile.
Chopper engines grow louder. 47’s back lit, coming in.
HEALY Let’s pack it up
The SEALs start gearing up. Tight on guys, stoic. Choppers land. SEALs muster up and start boarding.

DANNY’S POV:
100 stone and wood homes, well-constructed. Looks almost charming. A couple of dozen Afghan villagers in different parts of the village, kids playing, women cooking, two men working on a roof. Looks quite peaceful.
Left: trying to see the rest of the village. Can’t get a good view, a mountain is blocking his view.

MURPHY
Yea.
They study the surrounding area.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Let’s move down towards that peak,
see if that’s not better.
LUTTRELL Sounds good.
Luttrell looks back at Axe and Dietz. He soft whistles and rolls his index finger, points down towards the peak below them.
Axe and Danny immediately get it. They start moving out.
30 INT. J-BAD TOC 30 PETE MUSSLEMEN, one of the four SEALs left as part of the QRF

MURPHY We’re good.
Danny, on radio, trying to call in that they’ve relocated. Can’t get through.
DANNY (to Murphy)
No joy.
MURPHY Keep trying.
As the team sets up, Dietz is looking up at the small mountain behind him that seems to be killing his radio.
Series of shots:
Murphy and Luttrell scopes up, start counting Taliban. At forty, Luttrell looks to Murphy.
LUTTRELL That’s more than 10.
Yes.
MURPHY
Murphy is focused on a group of four men off to the side of the village playing a game with stones. Seeing who can throw the farthest.
DOWN IN VILLAGE

Can you make the fucking radio
work?
Dietz tries to call it in - no luck.

LUTTRELL
If we’re home by the 15th, me and

MURPHY
How does that help me?
LUTTRELL
Brahms horse auction is, I think
the 27th.
MURPHY
Is he selling Arabic horses?
Kristensen says I should get her whatever Silver was.
Silver?
LUTTRELL
MURPHY
Hi-Ho Silver. Lone Ranger’s horse.
LUTTRELL
Yea that’s a badass horse.
MURPHY
She doesn’t want a badass horse.
She wants an Arabic horse.
LUTTRELL
Dude, how’s she going to know the
difference. Get her a Quarter Horse, tell her it’s an Arabic. If she busts you, tell her if it’s good enough for the Lone Ranger...
MURPHY
How much for an Arabic?
LUTTRELL Probably around 15 grand.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Hell of a wedding present.
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL

DIETZ
I’ve seen you eat PowerBars.
AXE
Never. I don’t eat shit bars.
DIETZ Shit bars?

Why you eating a shit bar?

I’m eating it because I’m hungry.
AXE Eat an apple.

32 EXT. HINDU KUSH - MORNING 32 Sun getting higher. Low fog. Murphy, Axe, Luttrell sleep.
Danny on watch. Wedged into a tree stump.
ON DANNY.
Tired but awake. Alert. Quietly singing to himself.
TIGHT ON DANNY. His eyes a micro shift of focus. He stills himself ever so slightly.
DANNY’s POV
He’s looking down hill. Wide gentle slope of the mountain leading to a sharper drop. The fire lights up the village far below.
Nothing moves.
BACK to Danny. Eyes more focused. He slowly reaches down and kills the iPod.
Silence. Danny studies the hill with increasing focus. POV.
Nothing moves.
The three SEALs sleep.
Tight on Luttrell. Sleeping.
THEN a very faint sound from down hill. Silence. Then another.
Luttrell slowly opens his eyes. Listening. Another sound, a soft bell.
Marcus shifts, looks down hill.
Marcus’s POV
Looking down hill. Nothing moving. The sounds becoming more present. Bells.
Tight on Luttrell. Looking.
FADE OUT:
35.
BACK TO HIS POV
The empty hill. More Bells. Then cresting the hill. First just the tips of the ears. Then the forehead, nose, face....
A large male goat.
Bell ringing gently from his neck.
TIGHT ON MARCUS
Studying the goat.
As another goat appears. Then another...then another...then twenty...
A herd of goats moving up the hill right at them.
Marcus is wide awake, eyes scanning the hill scanning the goats when...
A human head crests the hill. A young Afghan BOY, ten years old.
Luttrell reaches for his Mark 12, looks over to Axe still sleeping. Then to Murph still sleeping. Then back to Danny.
Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid when...
Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a teenager.
The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three Afghans moving straight at the SEALs.
The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious noise. Murph and Axe both waking up.
Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre situation.
Back to Marcus as the first goat passes by. Then another. Tight on lead Afghan boy...THE GOAT BOY.
He’s heading dangerously close to Luttrell’s hide singing quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell. Gun up and trained on the goat boy as he gets closer...closer...and then in a one in a million...this fucking goat boy takes one more step and comes down square on Luttrell’s head.
36.
Luttrell moves, the kid screams, Luttrell’s up, gun up...screaming.
LUTTRELL Get the fuck down.
Axe, Danny, and Murphy. Guns up moving in fast on the terrified goat men...
DANNY Down Down Down.
The kid screams and starts running downhill towards the village. AXE sprints on him fast, takes the kid down, hand over mouth.
Kid bites and struggles wild.
Goats running in fear as the three Afghans are roughly thrown down. Searched, a military style Motorola walkie talkie taken from the old man, flex-cuffed and gagged...
When it’s done the four SEALs stand over them. Murphy looking at Luttrell.
Fuck.
MURPHY
Murphy looks to Dietz.
MURPHY (CONT’D) (re: radio)
Can you get a call out or what? Dietz reaches for his radio.
33 INT. J-BAD TOC 33
In the radio room. Musselman and Comms guys by their radios. SILENT. Clearly Spartan 01 is not getting through.
34 BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 34 The goats spread out, grazing, bells ringing loud. a large
dog, mouth foaming, growls and bark at the team.
Luttrell raises his Mark 12 at the dog when it gets too close.
Murphy is trying to interrogate the older man with a translation box. He speaks into it and it’s supposed to translate into Pashto.
37.
They have separated the older man from the boys. Murphy and Luttrell have them off to the side.. Axe stands watch over the boy.
MURPHY
(speaking into the Phrase-
O-Later)
Are you looking for Americans?
A robotic-like voice used for making out the question in Arabic.
The old man stares at Murphy with a combination of hatred and confusion.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Do the Taliban know we are up here?
Death stare from the old man. Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Do they know?
The old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Say again. Are you Taliban?
The old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate his slang Pashtun.
TRANSLATION MACHINE
Do not drink with many blood rooms
fire and knives...
MURPHY
This fuckin thing’s not working...
The machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Shut the fuck up !
Murphy throws the machine on the ground.
The dog makes another move at Luttrell. Fangs mashing. Luttrell raises his gun. The dog backs down.
35 OMIT 35
38.
36 EXT. BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 36 Danny continues to try his radio.
DANNY
Spartan 01, Spartan base...Spartan
01, Spartan base...
Murphy standing just off the group calls Luttrell over.
MURPHY Marcus.
Leaving Axe on security. Luttrell moves up the hill fifty feet with Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
Murphy’s God Awful law. Not you
Mikey. The other prick. The God of screw-ups.
Nothing.
Yea.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL Soft Compromise bro.
MURPHY
Yea. I’m aware of that.
Murphy digs into his pack, pulls out his SATELLITE PHONE. Checks numbers on his wrist pad. Dials up J-Bad TOC (Command Center).
MURPHY (CONT’D) (a touch frustrated: to
Dietz)
I’m now going to be that guy calling on a fucking unsecure Sat line because your radio is not functioning.
DIETZ
Move that mountain, we’re good.
Talk to the mountain, sir.
39.
Loses the signal twice. Third try he gets through. Horrible connection.
37 INT. J-BAD TOC 37 A phone rings, answered by a young Marine, SGT. HASSLERT.
HASSLERT
J-Bad TOC, SERGEANT HASSLERT.
MURPHY
Sergeant can you hear me, this is
Spartan 01, can you here me? Horrible delays, echoes and static.
Hello?
HASSLERT
MURPHY
This is Spartan 01, do you hear me?
HASSLERT I hear you.
MURPHY
This is not a secure line and I
need to speak to the CO immediately.
The CO?
HASSLERT
MURPHY That’s correct.
HASSLERT Which CO sir?
MURPHY Commander Kristensen.
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen is not here

MURPHY
What do you mean he’s not there?
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen left this
morning.
40.
Murphy realizing Right. That’s
STATIC BAD Hello?
Hello?

MURPHY
Fuck. He’s back at BAGRAM.
HASSLERT correct sir.
MURPHY HASSLERT MURPHY
I‘m here, I need to speak right now with the commander.
HASSLERT Commander is in BAGRAM.
MURPHY
I know that can you please transfer
this call to BAGRAM OUELLETTE TOC.
HASSLERT Roger that. Stand by.
MURPHY Standing by.
Silence Murphy looks down at the goat herders. Moves over to Danny with the radio. Holding up his SAT phone.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
(re: SAT phone)
Handing them our goddamned position.
Tight on Murphy, the realization of how fucked they are is starting to settle in.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What’s the fucking problem?
DANNY Don’t know.
MURPHY
Does it need new fucking batteries?
41.
DANNY
No, it’s fine but they won’t
fucking answer me.
38 INT. OUELLETTE TOC 38
It’s quiet. Among the SEALs present: Patton, James Suh, Dan Healy. A phone in the SEAL TOC rings answered by PATTON
SHANE PATTON Ouellette TOC Petty Officer
Patton..
MURPHY Patton, this is Murphy.
Really Bad connection.
SHANE PATTON
You’re looking for Mike Murphy?
MURPHY This is Mike Murphy.
SHANE PATTON Mike Murphy?
MURPHY
Yes correct, this is Mike Murphy. A horrible connection.
Patton is confused. He knows that Murphy and his team are way deep on their opp.
Mike?
SHANE PATTON
MURPHY Is this Shane?
SHANE PATTON
It’s Shane. What’s up Mike? This
connection sucks.
MURPHY
Are you not receiving our transmissions?
SHANE PATTON Radio calls? Not in a while.
Patton yells over to the Comms guys.
42.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) Are you all hearing anything from
SPARTAN 1.
COMMS GUY
When? We’ve been communicating.
SHANE PATTON (back on the phone)
They say they are communicating with you.
MURPHY Say again.
SHANE PATTON
Comms says that you are good. Copy?
MURPHY
In the last twenty minutes?
SHANE PATTON (back to comms guy)
You talked in the last twenty minutes?
COMMS GUY Negative.
SHANE PATTON (into phone)
Negative Murph.
MURPHY
I need the skipper now.
SHANE PATTON He’s sleeping sir.
MURPHY Wake him up now.
Murphy’s voice is electronically garbled.
SHANE PATTON
Did you say wake him up sir?
MURPHY Right the fuck now!
SHANE PATTON Roger that.
43.
39 EXT. BAGRAM TOC. 39
SHANE PATTON barefooted jogs out of the TOC moves through a series of plywood barracks. Knocks on a door.
SHANE PATTON Skipper. Skipper.
He knocks harder.
SKIPPER! From inside.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
KRISTENSEN (oc)
What?
SHANE PATTON
Sir sorry sir. I’ve got Lieutenant
Murphy on the phone in the TOC. Says he needs to talk to you. Now.
A moment, then Kristensen’s door flies open. Kristensen in his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking up.
39A Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC. 39A Reaches for the phone.
KRISTENSEN (into phone)
Mike? Silence Static.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.
PATTON reads Murphy’s SAT phone number off the board. Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Is it dead?
SHANE PATTON
Yes sir. What’d he want?
KRISTENSEN
44.
SHANE PATTON No idea sir.
KRISTENSEN Did he say anything?
SHANE PATTON
Just that he needed to speak to
you.
KRISTENSEN Anything wrong?
SHANE PATTON Didn’t say sir.
Stay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of the Valley.
TIGHT ON KRISTENSEN
Thinking.....
40 EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN 40 Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.
MURPHY
Can someone explain to me why they
both crash at the same time?
LUTTRELL AXE
Murphy’s law. Murphy’s law
Now a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR
walkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Spartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to
anyone listening. Over.
LUTTRELL
We could light these goats on fire
and smoke signal our way out of here.
DANNY
I could go down to the village and
ask to borrow a phone.
Murphy just stares at the goat herders.
45.
MURPHY
(quietly to himself)
Fuck.
LUTTRELL
You’d get some interesting tile
ideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt Brown. Goat skin blond, she’ll dig that a hell of a lot more than what is it Honey creme...?
The goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is getting focused. Doing the math.
The kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he’s still fast as shit.
AXE Fuck me.
He charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.
MURPHY
I’m thinking three ways this plays
out.
All eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We let em go, we’re gonna fight. So
we can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.
DIETZ Three?
AXE
Three, soft Compromise. Terminate
the compromise.
Axe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.
Murphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.
MURPHY
Can we get a signal from that
mountain?
46.
DANNY
I thought about that. Probably. I
don’t fucking know.
More dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.
DANNY (CONT’D) We gotta do something boss.
MURPHY
Yea.
Murphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
They don’t seem to like us very
much.
MURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.
AXE
Shah’s down there. We let them go,
Shaw disappears. Mission fails.
MURPHY What? Kill them.
Axe stares at Murphy.
Murphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.
AXE
We are compromised Mike.
Marcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.
Yea.
Shit.
LUTTRELL
47.
MURPHY Danny?
Danny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...
DANNY
I don’t give a shit what you
decide. I’m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You’re the big bucks, earn em’.
Murphy turns to Marcus.
MURPHY Marcus?
LUTTRELL I don’t know Mikey.
Luttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.
LUTTRELL (CONT'D)
I don’t know. I don’t like it. We
kill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...
AXE Then what?
LUTTRELL
I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be
private. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don’t want that legacy, bro. I’m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.
48.
AXE
I’m not either, but the
Old man’s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.
LUTTRELL
Let’s just tie ‘em up and get the
fuck out of here.
AXE
We tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.
LUTTRELL
Then let’s just get the fuck out of
here.
I will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.
MURPHY
You want to kill, Axe? Really?
That’s your position?
AXE
I want to be playing golf with
Freddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I’m having a little trouble getting a tee time.
LUTTRELL
If we kill these kids, it’s International news. CNN doesn’t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That’s the story. Forever.
Tight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.
MURPHY
Axe what’s your call?
AXE
49.
Axe stares at Murphy.
AXE (sad grin)
My final answer?
49A.
MURPHY Your final answer.
AXE Kill them.
This hits hard.
MURPHY Danny?
Dietz stares at the tied up kids.
DANNY It’s your call bro.
MURPHY
You don’t have an opinion?
DANNY
Yea I have an opinion. Two
opinions. One is that for the record I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That’s it. That’s our business.
MURPHY What’s two?
DANNY
Two is, this is the Navy and you’re
the boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I’m fucking told.
Ok.
MURPHY
DANNY
So you tell me what to do and it
will be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.
MURPHY
Marcus what’s your call?
Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy’s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he’s the tie-breaker.
50.
ON MURPHY.
LUTTRELL
(slowly shaking his head)
No. I’d rather fight them straight up. I don’t want to kill these kids.
Thinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.
MURPHY (quiet)
Fuck me.
Murphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.
DANNY
Look at them. They fucking hate us.
We don’t know how many Hajji’s they have down there. We can’t let them go.
LUTTRELL
So now you have an opinion? I
thought you were standing by waiting for your orders?
AXE
This opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I’ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It’s a cursed opp.
MURPHY
Starting to feel like a cursed opp.
LUTTRELL
It’s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That’s all. Everyday man. Devil’s asshole.
AXE
Shah just killed twenty marines
last week and we’re on him. We’ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.
(MORE)
51.
AXE (CONT'D)
We’re letting him go and why in the
fucking world does he have the right to do that to us?
Axe is starring at LUTTRELL.
51A.
Silence.
AXE.
Seriously Marcus. Why does he have
the right to do that to us?
LUTTRELL
I don’t see it that way.
MURPHY
So what is your fucking call bro?
LUTTRELL
Let them go. Shut it down.
So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.
This is all on MURPHY.
Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.
Murphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.
MURPHY
Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack
up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em go and we’re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We’re calling QRF and we’re getting out.
Silence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.
MURPHY (CONT’D) That’s what we’re going to do.
DANNY Roger that.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY Let’s move it.
Quick Shots.
The guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.
52.
The older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.
52A.
41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41
Kristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.
The Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01, Spartan 01, over.
Kristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC
KRISTENSEN
When was your last contact with
Spartan 01?
42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.
The Apache pilots are firing up their engines.
Musslemen comes out of a pilot station.
MUSSLEMEN
Where are you guys going?
APACHE PILOT
We just got called North. By an
Army 372, evidently they took some small fire.
MUSSLEMEN
We’re QRF, bro.
APACHE PILOT
That’s what we thought. BAGRAM is
now QRF.
The 47s?
Correct.
Are we not the QRF now?
APACHE PILOT That’s my understanding.
Mussleman is a bit confused...
MUSSLEMEN
APACHE PILOT
MUSSLEMEN
53.
Apache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.
43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43
10 MINUTES LATER:
Gear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.
MURPHY CONT’D Everybody good?
Quick nods from the team as Murphy’s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.
MURPHY
You three just won the lottery.
Speak well of us.
An odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.
Go!
MURPHY (CONT’D)
The little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.
The old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.
Then he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.
Murphy looks at the team.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Let’s move it.
The four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.
There is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.
43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.
54.
Leaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid’s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.
43B UP TOP. 43B
Slow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.
On AXE
Constantly checking behind him.
His left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.
Axe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.
Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.
Murphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.
You ok?
LUTTRELL.
AXE Fucking Afghanistan.
LUTTRELL.
Yea. I’m the one who’s supposed to
be falling.
AXE I’m fine.
He takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.
43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.
43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.
AXE (CONT'D) I’m good. Let’s go.
Axe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.
55.
AXE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should just hike down to
the village, ask to borrow a phone.
Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle.
44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44
Quiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.
TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.
Villagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.
A couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.
TRACKING with the two Taliban.
As they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.
Taliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.
Shah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.
Quick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK’s, RPG’s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.
Quiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...
45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.
Fuck.
MURPHY
He’s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.
Danny?
MURPHY (CONT'D)
56.
Dietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.
Nothing.
DANNY (on radio)
Anvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.
MURPHY Great.
Comms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.
All three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV
Nothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.
They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.
CUT TO:
46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46
Danny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.
Murphy’s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can’t.
He’s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it’s blocking his signal.
MURPHY (to mountain)
Move Bitch.
Luttrell’s fifteen feet to his left.
LUTTRELL What do you want to do?
MURPHY
Go home, get in bed, and watch
Anchorman.
57.
Check.
LUTTRELL
MURPHY I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL
Roger that. Should I spread the
word?
MURPHY
Not just yet. Let’s hold up for an
hour and see just how big of a can of hell we’ve opened.
LUTTRELL What do you think?
MURPHY
We did the right thing. We let our
love light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn’t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?
LUTTRELL
You think they’re coming after us?
MURPHY
Like a pack of wild dogs.
MURPHY keys his radio.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What say you Axe?
AXE (on radio)
I’m fine.
Murphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.
MURPHY (to Axe)
You good to go?
AXE
No problems boss.
MURPHY
Here’s the deal. Lay low here.
Soon as the sun sets we move.
(MORE)
58.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
If we can’t get comms from that top we’re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you’re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.
46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on
the glass.
It’s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.
ON AXE.
Calmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell resting.
Danny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.
Murphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.
Back to Axe. Focused down range.
Down the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.
Just catches Axe’s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.
THEN
More movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.
Stops whistling.
AXE’S POV:
No movement.
Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.
A HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.
AXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see’s more movement.
They are almost surrounded.
TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.
59.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)
Sssst! Sssst!
Luttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.
Sees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)
Try and call it in.
Danny desperate to get the radio to work.
Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.
LUTTRELL’S POV.
Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.
LUTTRELL looks left.
More Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.
More Taliban.
The SEALs are FUCKED.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
How the fuck fast are these little
bastards? All four SEALs guns up.
Marcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?
LUTTRELL
I’m thinking that we’re about
fixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.
Yea.
MURPHY
60.
LUTTRELL
Looks like I voted wrong.
MURPHY
Negative. We’ve been given the
opportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.
LUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.
ON DANNY AND AXE
Looking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.
DANNY Do they see us?
AXE Dunno.
BACK TO MARCUS.
His back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.
Danny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.
Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.
The trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.
A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.
A flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.
Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.
Luttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.
Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.
Marcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:
61.
A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.
Hold.
THEN.
Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.
An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.
Stops.
Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s head.
The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.
Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.
Taraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.
ON MURPHY.
Taliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.
A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.
The SEALs are close to being surrounded.
MURPHY checks his rear.
MURPHY POV
A cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.
Murphy calls it.
Push right flank.
MURPHY
62.
Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.
Luttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.
DANNY
Spartan 01 reporting major enemy
contact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.
Murphy’s doing the same with his SAT phone. He’s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.
Danny’s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.
He tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Marcus!
Luttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.
LUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.
DANNY Roger that.
Taliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.
MURPHY
Danny did you get the call through?
DANNY
I made the call. Don’t know if it
went through. You?
MURPHY
I couldn’t get a line.
DANNY Fuck.
Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.
Charging the Ambush.
63.
MURPHY
Keep pushing right. Kill ‘em all.
The four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.
The Taliban close enough to see clearly.
Axe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.
TALIBAN POV:
From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.
Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.
Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.
Luttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.
FURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.
Danny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.
DANNY Goddammitt.
Pissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.
Danny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.
MURPHY Can you fight?
DANNY Roger that.
64.
MURPHY
Want me to take the radio?
DANNY Negative.
Murphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.
MURPHY (yelling)
AXE?!
AXE Sir!
MURPHY
Can we break that flank? Hold
this, we’re gonna push left!
Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.
Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:
AXE POV.
Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.
The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.
Luttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.
From the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.
Marcus and Axe start moving left. Both shot during the move - Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.
65.
47 INT. TOC. BAGRAM 47 Comms guy at radio. Checking wall clock. See’s Kristensen,
Shane, and some of the other Team 10 guys.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01 is about to miss a comms
second window.
65A.
How long?
KRISTENSEN
COMMS GUY 2 hours 15 minutes.
Tight on Kristensen. Thinking. Checking the clock.
KRISTENSEN Call me if they miss two.
COMMS GUY Roger that.
48 EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.
A massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban flank.
AXE Right is no good.
Murphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into firing positions.
MURPHY Fuck me.
The first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards. Covering them with dirt and rock.
Luttrell swings his gun left and starts firing into the left Taliban position.
Mikey? Yea? You ok?
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL MURPHY
We’re good.
A bullet slams in Murphy’s lower stomach.
MURPHY (CONT’D) This is no good.
66.
LUTTRELL Roger that.
MURPHY
Can we break that right flank?
LUTTRELL Negative. We got to go left.
MURPHY Negative.
From downhill, two RPG’s fire at their position.
Dietz takes a shot in his upper-right chest.
A massive double RPG explosion. Tears away chunks of granite. Shrapnel cutting deep into all four SEALs. They are now clearly under attack from all three sides.
LUTTRELL
We can take ‘em Mikey but I’m
thinking we’re gonna need a new spot.
Tight on Murphy.
MURPHY Roger that.
He turns behind him giving that 50 ft. cliff a second look.
The Taliban gunfire is relentless now. Coming from all three sides.
Luttrell, Danny and Axe returning constant fire. Reloading mags. Firing away. Marcus hit for the first time in his right ass cheek.
Tight on Murphy:
MURPHY (CONT’D) We gotta fall back.
Luttrell looks at the cliff behind them.
LUTTRELL You mean fall off.
67.
MURPHY
Roger that. Fall off. Danny can you
move?
DANNY No problem.
Axe?
MURPHY
AXE Good to go.
As the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and start falling immediately. Danny’s legs giving out, buckling as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.
Marcus turns to Murphy.
Luttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...
They fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.
48A IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48A
Bone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off. The SEALs crash and bounce and flip. Finally settling hard on a reasonably flat part of the cliff. 300 yards below.
48B SILENCE. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48B
Tight on Luttrell. Face down. The first to move.
Face lifts. Nose clearly broken. Luttrell looks to his left.
Murphy struggling to his knees. Broken teeth. Face shredded. To the right, Danny and Axe.
MURPHY Hey Marcus.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY That sucked.
68.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY
I mean that really sucked.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
Voices screaming up the mountain.
48C TOP OF 1ST CLIFF 48C
Taraq is at the jump point looking down the steep cliff. Feels unsurvivable. Several fierce lieutenants flanking Shah.
Go.
SHAH
Dozens of Taliban start making their way down the steep cliff.
48D AT THE BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48D Murphy, Marcus Axe and Dietz struggling to their feet.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Luttrell sees the blood pouring from Murphy’s gut.
LUTTRELL Let me see it.
Pulling up Murphy’s shirt revealing a decent gut shot. Marcus looks for his med kit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Lost my med kit.
MURPHY Where’s your gun?
Luttrell looks down. To his left, then right. Spots his gun ten feet away in the dirt.
69.
LUTTRELL
God’s looking out for us.
MURPHY
If this is looking out for us I
don’t want to see him pissed.
LUTTRELL
We’re doing good Mikey we just
gotta...
Luttrell interrupted by a series of severe incoming RPG’s. Blasting all around them.
Luttrell and Murphy dive behind some fallen trees. Looking up.
MURPHY
We just got to get off this hill.
48E HALFWAY DOWN 1ST CLIFF. 48E
Shah’s Taliban are slowly moving down the cliff. Not nearly as fast as the SEALs fall. But they are definitely coming.
48F ON LUTTRELL and MURPHY. LOG HIDE. 48F
Returning fire. Picking off a couple of Taliban but revealing their position. More incoming RPG’s tearing into the cover trees.
Trees start burning.
A metal hook - RPG debris - spears into Luttrell’s right side.
He keeps firing when from the left... A LOUD CRASHING.
Two bodies falling hard.
Axe and Danny. Falling hard like Murphy and Luttrell. Slamming, flipping, landing 50 ft to the right of the tree hide.
Axe shot up getting to his feet. The Taliban shooting down at him.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Axe! Here! Move it buddy. Run!
Axe sees Murphy behind the trees. Charges to the hide.
70.
AXE This sucks.
No hesitation - Axe slams a fresh magazine into his M4 starts firing up the hill. Marcus is looking back to Danny.
Danny is dead still. No movement.
Axe provides cover as Luttrell and Murphy, dodging RPG’s and a hailstorm of AK fire, grabbing an alive but seriously fucked up Danny.
Picking Danny up they start hauling him back to the tree for cover.
TIGHT on Danny as a Bullet slams through his right rib cage
DANNY
(eyes tight, through
mashed teeth) Goddamn this sucks.
Luttrell and Murphy slam into the tree hide propping Danny up.
The four SEALs back together ready to fight. Marcus trying to treat Danny; pulling out his Burst Kit
Danny recovering staring down at his blood-soaked hand, dazed, looks to Marcus
DANNY (CONT’D) Marcus, I’m shot.
LUTTRELL
We are all shot bro, can you fight?
Danny stares back down at his bleeding, mangled hand, then at his gun.
DANNY (muttering to himself)
Mess up my drawing hand, that pisses me off.
Danny raises his gun uphill, takes aim at a Taliban fighter jumping from rock to rock. Danny fires killing the Taliban. Re-aims, fires, kills a second. Re-aims, fires, kills a third.
Looks to Marcus.
I can fight.
DANNY (CONT’D)
71.
The SEALs now packed into a burning LOG HIDE fighting as best as they can from inferior position.
48G UP HILL. 48G
Taliban starting to re-mass. Dialing in on the SEALs position.
Thirty AK-47’s firing down on the SEALs.
48H IN THE LOG HIDE. 48H

SEAL POV.
AK tracers streak over head. MURPHY has his face next to Dietz.
DANNY (CONT'D)
I tried ‘em at least three times
boss.
MURPHY Nothing?
DANNY Nothing.
Murphy and Dietz both take rounds. Danny in the foot.
Three of Murphy’s right toes blow off. His boot leaking blood.
Murphy returning fire. Hot brass shell casings falling into his shirt.
MURPHY Dammit!
Murphy getting the brass out of his shirt.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Goddamnitt!
Danny screaming in pain. Eyes pouring tears. MURPHY (CONT'D)
Danny?
72.
DIETZ
This really sucks man. Really
fucking sucks. Fucking burning inside bro.
Axe and Luttrell trying to fire over the logs. Luttrell hurls a grenade.
Taliban with RPG’s moving into firing position.
AXE We gotta move!
As the first RPG blows into the side of the log hide.
Wood daggers and burning embers explode and rip through clothes and skin.
MURPHY Move left! Left!
Axe and Luttrell start moving out.
Dietz struggling to get up, radio pulling him backwards. Murphy reaches back for Dietz.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Give me a hand Danny.
Danny dazed stares up at Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D) Come on buddy! We got to move.
A second RPG demolishes the hide. Fully exposing Murphy and Dietz.
Murphy yanks Dietz to his feet.
MURPHY (CONT'D) Right now bro.
DIETZ I’m with you.
Murphy fires up the hill.
73.
Dietz grinds it out following Luttrell.
Murphy lays out more cover fire, then turns and moves after the three SEALs.
48J SIDE OF MOUNTAIN. Ravine. 48J
Tight shots of the four SEALs scrambling for their lives. Bleeding, spit, sweat, snot, tears as they claw their way across the burning mountain.
This is a sequence. Watching the men run. Legs buckling. Knee caps smashing on rock. Slipping falling helping each other. Incoming rounds tearing past them. Daytime trace fire.
The SEALs charge across the side of the mountain.
Breathing is hysteric. High-pitched wheezing and gagging. They are literally running cross a burning mountain for their lives.
Luttrell first to stop. Tight on Luttrell.
LUTTRELL Gotta fucking rest.
Axe collapses next to him, then Murphy, then Dietz. All four SEALs gasping and choking for air.
A moment of desperate attempts to get air.
AXE Need some water.
MURPHY
We got to get to the village. Got
to.
LUTTRELL
Got to.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Dietz is by far the worst. Trying to breath. Blood loss starting to weaken him.
Murphy pulls out his sat phone, tries to get a signal.
74.
Tight on Each SEAL. Burning. Sucking air. Luttrell stares at Dietz.
Hold this for a couple of beats. A brief silence. A pause.
LUTTRELL This is bad....
49 INT. SEAL TOC BAGRAM. 49 Kristensen watching clock. Drinking coffee.
KRISTENSEN That’s the second window.
Correct.
COMMS GUY
Clear tension in the TOC.
A half dozen SEALs gathered in the TOC.
Kristensen picks up phone. Dials the large force special opps TOC (Base control)
Intercut with Kristensen and CO of JOC. Kristensen letting CO know that he’s missed two windows of contact with Spartan 01.
50 EXT. MOUNTAIN - GUNFIGHT. 50
Back tight on four SEALs. Still silent, trying to recover,
Then.
Sounds of the Taliban yelling. Communicating as they start to get closer.
Luttrell looks over to Dietz. Whispering.
LUTTRELL How you feeling Danny?
DIETZ
Shot me up pretty good bro.
LUTTRELL You’re good Danny.
Axe, Murphy, Luttrell, counting mags and grenades.
Trying to compose themselves. Luttrell packing dirt into Danny’s gun shot wounds.
75.
Looks back to Murphy.
Everyone whispering. Trying to stay as quiet as possible. The Taliban has lost them.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Pack ‘em with dirt. Tight.
Murphy literally balling up dirt and jamming it into his guts. Trying to plug the blood flow.
50A CLIFF ABOVE ROCK QUARRY 50A
With Taraq and his men as they move through the mountain. Searching for the SEALs.
50B SEALs HIDING IN ROCK QUARRY 50B Dead quiet. Alert.
Luttrell moves Axe checking his wounds.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) You’re okay.
Danny blurts out. Loud voice.
DIETZ
How’d they get on us so fast Mikey?
Murphy and Axe on him. Hands around his mouth.
AXE
Shhhhhh. Danny Shhhhhh.
Silence. The SEALs wait, tense.

Signals to his men. They start moving in on the SEALs
50D SEALs IN THE ROCK QUARRY: 50D
Axe slowly removing his hand from Danny’s mouth. Danny looking up wide eyed at Murphy.
DIETZ Mike?
MURPHY
You got to be quiet Danny.
76.
DIETZ (whispering)
I know. I just can’t get over how fast they are.
Yea.
MURPHY
DIETZ Faster than we are.
MURPHY They might be.
DIETZ
Mike how did they get on us so
fast?
MURPHY
Don’t know. Don’t get it.
Dietz is starting to lose it.
DIETZ
Got on us pretty fast. I was
talking to my mom, she didn’t say anything about it. Matty you see them?
AXE
I didn’t see until you did Danny.
DIETZ
So much fucking red man. Really
vivid reds.
Taliban voices growing louder. Luttrell looks to Murphy.
LUTTRELL We got to move Mike.
50E EXT. 2ND CLIFF 50E The only option for movement is down. Another 80 ft. drop. The rocks above Axelson start to shear. Incoming rounds. Above them silhouetted Taliban fighters.
The team once again surrounded. Murphy starring down the cliff.
77.
MURPHY
Axe, how shot up are you?
Axe looking down at himself. Inventorying his bullet wounds.
AXE
I think three times. I’m hit
three... I don’t know what this is.
Blood oozing from the back of his head. Behind his right ear.
MURPHY
Are you good to move?
AXE Move where?
MURPHY We’re going down.
Axe looks downhill. AXE’s POV
Another massive drop. Sharp Granite, trees, and a brutal pitch.
AXE
Hoo-yah to that Murph.
51 EXT. CLIFF ABOVE ROCK QUARRY 51
Over the back of Taraq, fighters on both sides. Slow mo as they move fast through, in front of them the ravine hiding the SEALs.

Murphy turns, pushes up and simply stands. Completely exposed. He starts running uphill to the exposed rock, hitting send on the SAT phone.
Luttrell and Axe lay down cover as Murph charges up the hill, taking repeated rounds. Legs, arms, guts, Murphy makes it to the clearing, the SAT connection locks in. Murphy sits on a rock oblivious to the incoming rounds.

Axe moves to his left, Luttrell to his right.
Tight on Axe. Shot up. Blood pouring from head wound. Tough. Grinding it out. Staying low. Deep breathing. Grunting as he crosses the mountain.
Gun fire erupts around him. Turning, spots half a dozen Taliban on him.

Tight on Luttrell.
Looking down at the small rock slide, hearing its noise....

Marcus looking cross mountain at Axe who has managed to transverse one hundred feet of the mountain and is leading a small pack of Shah’s men away from Luttrell.
Axe starts taking heavy fire. Shot twice through the throat. Falling backwards. Trying to get up. Back to his weapon.
AXE DYING.
Marcus watching helpless from across the mountain. Trying to cover Axe as the Taliban move in on him.
Not all of them have followed Axe because as Marcus turns back an RPG blows ten feet in front of him. Shrapnel and rock smashing into the side of his head.
His Helmet tears off his head.

Tight on Marcus rolling backwards. Falling. Tumbling further down the mountain.
Tight on his helmet, Texas flag painted bold across it. Rolling and smashing down the mountain.

Taraq and his men hear the incoming Apaches.
Shah orders his men to take cover. The Taliban quickly becoming invisible from the sky.
83B DOWN HILL: 83B
Marcus deaf to the incoming Apaches. Has no idea how close they are. As he falls, gets up, off balance stumbles off a 30 ft drop.
This time not so lucky with his landing, comes down hard, shatters his right shin, bone tears through his skin, compound fracture.
Screaming in pain, Luttrell crawls into a rock crevasse. Hiding, he attempts to clear his head.
We play all of Luttrell’s audio perspective here as deaf. Abstract surges of sound. He’s basically deaf.
The Apaches fly high over head. Missing Luttrell. Disappearing over mountain tops as they keep moving to avoid enemy ground fire.
Struggling to silence his hysterical breathing, Luttrell hides as Taraq and his men move all around him. Luttrell sees shadows of the fighters. He silently starts covering himself with rocks and dirt.
Luttrell well hidden.
We slowly push in on him as his head starts to nod forward. He lifts it. Fighting the powerful urge for sleep. It falls again. He lifts it. Leaning his head back against the crevasse wall.
Taraq and his men back on the hunt. Searching rock to rock.
Tight on Luttrell. Head back. Breathing slower. As Luttrell falls to sleep.
FADE TO BLACK.

TIGHT ON MARCUS. Looks DEAD. EYES TWITCH. SLOWLY OPEN. LUTTRELL wakes up.
Disoriented. First thing he notices is the bird sitting up on a rock above him. He hears it. Sort of. Faded. Loud then silent. His hearing has partially returned.
LUTTRELL very slowly clears himself from the dirt and rock hide.
Inventories himself, his weapons.
Two magazines, two grenades. No food. No water.
Bleeding has stopped from his gunshot. Leg is fucked up. Shin bone busting out.
Luttrell sits down. Examining his leg. Probing the bone. Rips off his pants exposing his broken leg in UA shorts. Tears welling he bites down on his lips as he resets the broken bone. Jamming it back inside his skin.
Tucking back the bone.
Luttrell packs the puncture wound with dirt. Starts massaging his dead legs. Forcing blood back into them. Deep powerful breathing as he starts to will his body back into life.
104.
85 EXT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 85
Luttrell slowly moves out of the hide scanning the area for any sign of Taraq or Shah.
Luttrell sees nothing.
The village is close. Couple of hundred yards.
LUTTRELL moves out. Slowly picking his way down towards the village.
