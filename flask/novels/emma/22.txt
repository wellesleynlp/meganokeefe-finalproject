The Toronto Song Lyrics

I hate the skydome and the CN tower too
I hate Nathan Phillip's square and the Ontario Zoo
The rent's too high, the air's unclean
The beaches are dirty and the people are mean
And the women are big and the men are dumb
And the children are loopy cuz they live in a slum!
The water is polluted and their mayor's a dork
They dress real bad and they think they're New York
In Toronto, Ontario-o-o

You know, actually, I, I think I pretty much hate all of Ontario
(Oh yeah, me too!)
I hate Thunder Bay and Ottawa, Kitchener, Windsor, and Oshawa
London sucks and the Great Lakes suck and Sarnia sucks and Turkey point sucks

I took a trip to Ontario to visit Brian Mulroney
(Moosonee sucks and Beaverton sucks and Brighton sucks and Guelph sucks too)
He beat me up and he stole my pants and he put me in a tree

(Peterborough, Narva, and [inaudible] suck, [inaudible] and Uxbridge suck!)
I went to see the Maple Leafs and got hit in the head with a puck
(Ah, I-I don't even know how they did it really, I mean, I was playing the organ at the time!)
ONTARIO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O SUCKS

Yep, actually now that I think about it
I think I pretty much hate every gosh darn province and territory in our country
Oh yeah-except Alberta! Oh yeah, I love Alberta. Yeah, it's really nice, lots of cows, and trees, and rocks and dirt!
(moo moo moo)

But
I hate Newfoundland cuz they talk so weird, and Prince Edward Island is too small
Nova Scotia's dumb cuz it's the name of a bank, New Brunswick doesn't have a good mall!
Quebec is revolting and it makes me mad, Ontario Sucks, Ontario Sucks!
(Manitoba's population density is 1.9 people per square kilometre
Isn't that stupid!)
Saskatchewan is boring and the people are old
And as for the territories,( they're too cold!)
And the only really good thing about the province of British Columbia is that
It's right next to us
Cuz Alberta, doesn't suck, but Calgary doesssssss!
