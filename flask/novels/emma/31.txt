Boon 'elm Lyrics

I'm walkin' out on a dusty road
The sky is blue and my t-shirts torn
Up on a hill I found my thrill
And down in the valley I got my fill

Her skin was fair and her hair was long
Her body built with a frame strong
She broke down my front door at dawn
And now we're in bed and the day is done

Oh, but a man he can't always pretend, that he does understand

So I'm gonna keep somethings well hid
In a wooden box with a tight lid
Up on the hill I'll sing my tune
With my ear to the ground and my eyes on the moon

Oh but a man he can't always pretend, that he does understand
