Harriett Jones Lyrics

Would you listen Ms. Jones?
Let me please come home
Please girl

I was a fool, that's plain to see
Cause I had it all when you were with me
One little trip that brought my fall
And one little girl that started it all

When you were away I felt so all alone
I guess I was weak when I should've been strong
I got no right to be here on my knees
But my sweet Harriett Jones, still I'm beggin' you please

Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home
Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home

See I was doin' so good with this monogamy
But see these pretty young girls, they won't let me be
Since losing your love, I'm such a bitter man
And if you let me come home, I swear you'll understand

Right now, I spend all my nights sittin' here alone
Just drinkin' this wine, missing our happy home
To break it all down, I guess I'm tryin' to say
Some people must lose it all till they appreciate

Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home
Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home

Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home
Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby won't you let me come home

You're the love of my life
Been through so much together
Girl don't you know that you're my best friend
Give my love another try
Cause don't you know the stormy weather
Can bring a brighter love in the end

Just let me come home
Let me come home baby
My Harriett Jones
Ooh let me come home girl, please

Pretty pretty girls all over me
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be
Pretty pretty girls all over me
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be

Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
Baby I just wanna come home
Swing low, swing low, sweet Harriett
My baby, don't you know I'm trying to come home

Pretty pretty girls all over me
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be
Swing low, sweet Harriett
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be

Pretty pretty girls all over me
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be
Swing low, sweet Harriett
Pretty pretty girls won't let me be

Swing it all back to me
