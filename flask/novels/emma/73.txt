Bewitched / old argentina Lyrics

When I met you first you were walking through compartment doors from a platform queue and I knew
Alluring lips and hazel eyes, coming soon to a cinema near you
But I kept you close and loved you still while every kid in England knew of you
With witches hair, electrified, I want you like the sky tonight I do

You are my magical truth

[Chorus:]
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for
Tell me this is what I've been waiting for
I love a fallen angel so save me Thor
Baby this is what I have waited for

I fantasized, I wouldn't lose the image of your ballet shoes and this song is for you, of Holmes’ assistant fame - clever wordplay (my middle name is John)

Like Austen’s book, 1815, Yeah I’m Knightley, you’re Woodhouse, see my love?
Don’t tell me I’m bewitched I’ll dream - I've seen the trailer baby
I’m in love

You came from heaven above

[Chorus:]
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for
Tell me this is what I've been waiting for
I love a fallen goddess so save me Thor
Baby this is what I have waited for

Your beauty glorifies all that is good
You are a goddess here for me
I’m your teen vogue, your Despereaux
You are the graceful, blissful, mighty sea

Crash over me

[Chorus:]
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for
Tell me this is what I've been waiting for
I love a fallen goddess so save me Thor
Baby this is what I have waited for
