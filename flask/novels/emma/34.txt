Emma Lyrics

Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
Why don't you stay around
What's your dilemma, won't you please tell me, Emma
I don't wanna lay you down

Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around, you better start all over again
(Please tell me Emma, please tell me Emma)

Don't get excited you'll be invited
Wait for the wheel to turn
Don't be impatient you'll get liberated
Everybody's got to learn

You have got to make a contribution
Then you can start to draw your own conclusion
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)

Emma, Emma, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting
Emma, Emma, oh, oh, oh

Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around, you'd better start all over again, all over again
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)
(Please tell me, Emma, please tell me, Emma)

Emma, Emma, you'd better start relating (start relating)

Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
Why don't you stay around
Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
I don't wanna lay you, lay you, lay you down
Oh, pretty Emma, you sweet pretender
I don't wanna lay you down
Oh, pretty Emma
