All Day Today Lyrics

All day today! all night tonight! (x2)

Harriet Ross was a married woman
Living Just by the polce station
Friending with a COP called colie
All day today

All day today! all night tonight!(x2)

Harriet Ross was a married woman
Living Just by the polce station
Friending with a COP called colie
All day today

All day today! all night tonight! (x2)

Harriet Ross was a married woman
Living Just by the polce station
Friending with a COP called colie
All day today

All day today! all night tonight! (x2)

Harriet Ross was a married woman
Living Just by the polce station
Friending with a COP called colie
All day today

All day today! all night tonight! (x2)

Harriet Ross was a married woman
Living Just by the polce station
Friending with a COP called colie
All day today
