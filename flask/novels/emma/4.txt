Without Doubt Lyrics

It's the story of a fine young man
Got wrapped up doing all he can
Along the way fell down, got blood on his hands - not such a good example
Of a fine young man
And such a good example
Is what she left for this
My whole life's work
Is wrapped in this one kiss
But I know I must be a fine young man
And I know I'm not wrong this time
As I see her glide across the floor
