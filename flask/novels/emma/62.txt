But Not for Me Lyrics

Old man sunshine, listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain, it's the final curtain

I never want to hear
From any cheerful Polly Annas
Who tells you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky stars above but not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Ah, ho, alas and awe so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he never had eyes for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Ah ho alas and awe so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess, yes, he's not for me
