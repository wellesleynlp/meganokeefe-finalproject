Young Man Lyrics

Always the young man
Walks all alone every summer's (???)
Dancing to the beat of another drum
That's how the young girl (???)
And that's how the young man finds it
Always a heart beat
Following down every city street
And every time someone else is looking sweet
(???)
And the young man feeling haunted
Remember the first time
When everything feels right
Walking alone towards me
Always the young man
Always see a shape in the summer rain
Always see a flicker on a window pane
And the young man (???)
And the young girl knows it
Shoop-shoop
Ooh la la la
Shoop-shoop
Ooh la la la
Shoop-shoop
Ooh la la la
Ooh yeah
Always the young man
Always the young man
Always the young man
Always the young man
