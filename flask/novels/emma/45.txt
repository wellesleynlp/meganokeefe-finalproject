Harriet's Got a Song Lyrics

I don't stand a chance in this fucked up world
New school took romance and messed it up real bad
But your brand new eyes shrink me to a size
Make it hard to see my reality

You say I'm blind
I think you're wrong
Harriet's got a song
When we combine
Nothing goes wrong
Harriet's got a song

Scare myself sometimes. Lead me to the light
Pet and let me know it'll be alright
Watch me dive right into the shallow end
"Won't you be my friend? Won't you be my neighbor?"

You say I'm blind
I think you're wrong
Harriet's got a song
When we combine
Nothing goes wrong
Harriet's got a song

Do do do do...

Going off on me. Not only can I see
Memorized your scent, everywhere you went
Join our Wiccan church. Blaze the Satchel Perch
Everywhere you go - 100%

You say I'm blind
I think you're wrong
Harriet's got a song
When we collide
Nothing goes wrong
Harriet's got a song...got a song
