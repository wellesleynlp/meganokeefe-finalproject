Down Colorful Hill Lyrics

Out of the box
Down colorful hill
Wind lifting tired feet
Skin sensing challenge ahead

Prayers, prayers, prayers
For success
Prayers, prayers, prayers
Always die in time

Losing the dream
Face to face sleeping
Losing the dream
Open mouth breathing

Where unadmired beings
Dread the due changes ahead

Prayers, prayers, prayers
For success
Prayers, prayers, prayers
Always die in time

Like empty roofs above
Life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above
Rid of our love
