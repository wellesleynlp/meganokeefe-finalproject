But Not for Me Lyrics

Old man sunshine, listen you
Don't you tell me dreams come true
Just try it, and I'll start a riot

Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain, it's the final curtain

I never wanna hear
From any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you Fate
Supplies a mate
It's all bananas!

They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me

With love to lead the way
I found more clouds of gray
Than any Broadway play
Could guarantee

I was a fool to fall
And get that way
Hi-ho, alas
And also, lack-a-day

But still I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me
