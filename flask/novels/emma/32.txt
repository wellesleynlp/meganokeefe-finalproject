City Lights Lyrics

Johnny was a man of his word he said
"I've never been locked down before
Now I'm sitting in this fucking box
And I know there's gotta be more
I don't really give a fuck about it
It's done nothing for me
I don't really give a shit about it
I've seen all there is to see
I wanna go where the action is
I wanna see the city lights
Their using all their will to confine me
I won't go down without a fight
Another night on the railroad tracks
And I know I've had my fill
Severed arteries in a town
That's long over the hill"
