Rocking Chair Lyrics

[Verse]
Old rocking chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, before I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, going nowhere
Just set me here grabbing at the flies round this rocking chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rocking chair gets it, Judgement Day is here
Chained to my rocking chair

Old rocking chair's got me, son, (Rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side, (Yes, your cane by your side)
Now fetch me a little gin, son (I've got no gin, father)
What? before I tan your hide, now, (You're going to tan my hide)

You know, I can't get from this old cabin (What cabin? joking)
I'm going nowhere (Why ain't you going nowhere?)
Just sitting here grabbing (Grabbing)
At the flies round this old rocking chair (Rocking chair)

Now you remember dear old aunt Harriet, (Aunt Harriet)
How long in Heaven she be? (She's up in Heaven)
Send me down, send me down sweet (Sweet chariot) chariot
End of this trouble I see (I see, Daddy)

[Outro]
Old rocking chair gets it, son (Rocking chair get it, father)
Judgement Day is here, too (Your Judgement Day is here)
Chained to my rocking, old rocking chair
