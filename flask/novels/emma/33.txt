Seek For You Lyrics

Like a moth

Flies towards the light

Like an avalanche

Rolls increasingly down hill

So I seek for you

Manic Persisted

Is this a way

Traced out by a higher might

And is this a legacy

To go and find my other self

So I seek for you

Manic persisted

Our figures seem to mesh

Like gear wheels

Form an integrated whole

I'm a glassy box high up

Over all this soaring ground

Our figures seem to mesh

Like gear wheels

Form an integrated whole

I'm a glassy box high up

Over all this soaring ground
