XOX Lyrics

I like it when your eyes get big
I like the way you lurch
To and fro
And then in slo mo
Dig in and again you hit the floor

But you're determined
Your things in disarray
Do the Telescope
The Gear Failure
The Hot Box
The Broken Parts
You do the E Broke

You're sick in the mezzanine
Upset by what you seen
Right outta the balcany
Right into the silver screen
XOX

In between the stakes now
In between the girth
Right over the strap rail
Right over the dirt

Angola, Ashtabula, Mud Run
Camp Hill, PA
Between the rolling stock
And the fire box
We're all gonna roll out the strap rail to safety
