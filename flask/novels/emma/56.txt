Jane Lyrics

Jane you say it's all over for you and me girl
There's a time for love and a time for letting it be baby
Jane you're playing a game called, called hard to get by its real name
Making believe that you just don't feel the same, oh Jane
Jane you're playing a game you never can win, girl
You're staying away so I'll ask you where you been baby
Like a cat and a mouse, from door to door and house to house
Don't you pretend you don't know what I'm talking about
Where're all those nights we spent together, hey hey
Only because you didn't know better, I gotta know
Jane, you're playin' a game, playin' a game, playin' a game
Jane, Jane, Jane
Oh Jane you're playing a game of hide and go seek
Jane you're playing for fun but I play for keeps, yes I do
Jane, Jane, Jane, that's a game on me, yeah
Jane, Jane, Jane, so plain to see
Jane, Jane, Jane, Janey, Janey, Janey, Janey, Jane, yeah
Jane, Jane, Jane, why you foolin' with me, me, me?
Jane, Jane, Jane
Jane, Jane, Jane
Jane, Jane, Jane
Jane, Jane, Jane
Jane, Jane, Jane
