G.B. Lyrics

I ain't going back and nobody can make me
I ain't going back cause I'm living clean
We're living in a bad room self created
I ain't going back never never scene
Never again we say
Never again we say
Never again they say
Never again they say
I ain't going back cause this narrow suits me
I ain't going back for the shitty food
We're living in box with a big end doorway
Gotta keep clean it's the golden rule
Never again we say
Never again we say
Never again they say
Never again they
I ain't going back cause nobody can make me
I ain't going back cause I'm living clean
We're living in a bad room you created
I ain't going back to a never scene
Never again we say
Never again we say
Never again they say
Never again they say
