Harriet Lyrics

Through the hem of evening
Into the flesh of the night
You step out to receive them
In the bruising light

You leave your bed of novels
You leave your hovering crown
You leave your wit and your mettle
And you come down

But it's only a minute then
Til the hole in the canvas spreads
And it grows til there's nothing left

So if you even remember
Me after all that will come
Think of all i intended
Not what i've done

See me like an arrow
Still upon the bow
Set to the heart of the target
Hanging bright above

But it's only a minute then
Til the shot is released and sent
And lost to the shifting wind

Oh they don't know you, not like i do, not like us, harriet
But they would love you, just like i do, if they could, harriet
Cause what you are, and what you want, are so far apart, and they're travelling on
Oh what you are is staggering drunk, but i'll pick you up and i'll carry you off
Oh they don't know you, not like i know you, not like us, harriet
But they would love you, just like i love you, if they could, harriet
