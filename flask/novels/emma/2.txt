A Picture of Life Lyrics

A fine, young man
A picture of life
Dislikes himself
In the mirror
We saw him off
We talked of love
We talked of sin
And forgot him

A fine young man
A picture of life
Died alone
In the gutter
We drank the wine
We felt the pain
But no one felt
Like his mother

Father's not there
A coward's choice
He scorned his son
So inhuman
We shook our heads
And turned away
We also denied
That we knew him
