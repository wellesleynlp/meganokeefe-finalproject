I Guess It Wasn't Mine Lyrics

How can you blame me for
The way I never felt before and
All the mistakes that I made
It's just that I was so in love
I couldn't keep you close enough
I held too tight to the reins
Can't keep a moment from passing by
Love's not a thing that you own
Oh I
I guess it wasn't mine
I didn't mean to lose the love
It took so long to find
I guess it wasn't mine
I wore your heart upon my sleeve
A prize for all the world to see
A child's dream of soul possession
The thought of ever letting go
Was more than I could bear, you know
I just thought of my protection
Love is a gift that you give away
It's not a thing that you own
I could drive myself crazy
Tear myself down
But things will be different
Next time
