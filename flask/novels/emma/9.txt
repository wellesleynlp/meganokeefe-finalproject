Young Lyrics

I never sleep
I shoot up speed
I'm on top
Around the clock

I shoot up speed
A life of bliss
A new day comin'
I never miss

It never ends
I don't have friends
I've got my shot
I talk a lot

A one man show
I'm talkin' mono
Yakkety yak
Don't talk back

So

I never sleep
And break it up
I shoot up speed
I'm blessed in weed

I'm wide open
Around the clock
See me runnin' honey 'round the block
I stand up dreamin' I don't waste time

Feedback don't reach me
But I feel fine
Yakkety yak
Don't talk back

Cause you're young
Cause you're young
When you're young
When you're young

I've got my choice
So I can win
I'm still narcotic
Under my skin

I'm a wreck
Hear me moan
I'm suicidal
She ain't home

See the crowd
Go to the office
I can smile
Cause I'm the toughest
Fixin' speed
Fixin' the backseat
I'm hangin' out
I never sleep

Cause you're young
Cause you're young
When you're young
When you're young

I never sleep
I shoot up speed
I'm on top
Around the clock

I shoot up speed
A life of bliss
A new day comin'
I won't miss

It never ends
I don't have friends
I've got my shot
I talk a lot

A one man show
I'm talkin' mono
Yakkety yak
Honey - don't talk back

Cause you're young - yakkety yak - honey - don't talk back
Cause you're young - yakkety yak - don't talk back
When you're young - keeps me young
When you're young - keeps me young

Cause you're young
