Stuck In My Teeth Lyrics

I swear to God I'm not the same
As I was the other week
I got you stuck in my teeth

And though you take me for a fool
I've got better things to do
Then to prove myself to you

But you know I won't get back on
That road ahead it's too long
Another year with no strings
But It's fine

I'm a little too young with not enough time
I'm a little too young with not enough time

I woke up half the man I was
Fingers burnt down to the bone
Conversations on my own

If I could take me in, I would
And contradict the batting good
And find myself a brand new home

But you know I won't get back on
That road ahead it's too long
Another year with no strings
But It's fine

I'm a little too young with not enough time
I'm a little too young with not enough time

I'm a little too young with not enough time
I'm a little too young with not enough time

I'm a little too young with not enough time
I'm a little too young with not enough time

I'm a little too young with not enough time
I'm a little too young with not enough time

I'm a little too young with not enough time

But you know I won't get back on
That road ahead it's TOO LONG
Another year with no strings
But It's fine

I'm a little too young with not enough time
