Sick Machine Lyrics

Hey hey hey, don't forget to put that mouth into your pocket
So you can maintain the evil of your diet
You could build a bone toilet with the calories that roll off your shoulder
It could be a monument to our eating disorders

You are a virus
I am no longer a host for you

You got no manners in the bedroom get the jumper cables upstairs
You got no manners in the bedroom get your mattress out of 5th gear

I became a drunk driver to find a vaccine for immunity against your sick machine
You could build a support group
With the germs that you bring on vacation
You buy and sell my hopes as a Wall Street patient
