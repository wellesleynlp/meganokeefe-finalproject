Sleepy Eyed John Lyrics

Well a-way down yonder on the Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from my wagon seat
I fiddled my fiddle and I rubbed my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go

Sleepy-eyed John, you better your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John, better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
And try to get to heaven 'fore the Devil gets to you

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose he flopped but he couldn't get loose
Said John to the goose "If you don't be still
We'll miss my supper down in Candyville."

Well Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg
The little leg was nothing but a little wooden peg
One shoe off and one shoe on
He'll do the double shuffle 'til the cows come home

Now I got twenty dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since
Sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now

Well over the hickory and down the pine
The raccoon laughed and the old hound whined
John said "Sic 'em" and the raccoon left
They crossed Green River in a minute and a half
