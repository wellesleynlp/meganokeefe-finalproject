The Very First Christmas Lyrics

[Spongebob and Patrick:]
It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday
Not your normal, average, everyday

[Squidward:]
Sounds like someone fell my old coral tree
Spongebob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me?

[Spongebob and Patrick:]
The world feels like it's in loverly

Squidward:
Go away before I harm you bodily

Spongebob and Patrick:
This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me

[Spongebob and Patrick:]
There'll be shopping, decorating, and plenty of snow

[Spongebob:]
Hey Patrick, who's that under the mistletoe?

[Squidward:]
What? Who me? Would you look at the time
I should go!

[Plankton:]
People seem a little more brotherly

[Mr. Krabbs:]
Here's a special something to you from me

[Spongebob and Patrick:]
Even the trash on Christmas smells sweetly
This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me

[Squidward:]
What do you want, can't you see that I'm busy?

[Spongebob and Patrick:]
Step outside, we've got something for you to see

[Squidward:]
Spongebob, take this stuff down immediately

[Spongebob:]
Chestnuts roasting and burns in the third degree

[Bikini Bottom Residents:]
Tonight things are as good as they seem to be

[Patrick:]
A star on top will complete all the scenery

[Bikini Bottom Residents:]
This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me
This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me
