What I Could Stand For Lyrics

Can you tell me about yourself
I am partial to life without
How long have you wanted this
How do I say this
I've always wanted this
What are your weaknesses

Where in ten can you see yourself
I remark to the tenth without
How much can you benefit
How do I say it
I always benefit
What are your weaknesses

What are your weaknesses
What are your weaknesses

And I won't pass you by
I won't pass you by
I won't pass you by
I won't pass you by

I won't pass you by

It's autumn love
It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
You group it and you group it
And it's autumn love

It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
You group it and you group it
And it's autumn love
(It's just the several of us)
It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
Group it and you group it
And it's autumn love

It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
Group it and you group it
And it's autumn love

(It's just the several of us)
It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
Group it and you group it
And it's autumn love

It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
Group it and you group it
And it's autumn love

(It's just the several of us)
It's autumn love
(You're better for the group it)
Group it and you group it
And it's autumn love
