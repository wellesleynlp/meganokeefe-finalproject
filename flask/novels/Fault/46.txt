True Or False? Lyrics

Sometimes I look forward to, finding the line
Pulling it in to find, there is no end to time
Waiting for judgement day, Marching away
Staring into our face
I can see Human race bent on destruction
But I believe in reconstruction
Is it true, or false is it true, or false
Tell me someone please, cause I need to know
I see good ol' Thomas Edison
Science and medicine
There goes Albert Einstein
Never learn their lesson
Fuel to the flame
Since man discovered Fire
It will be the same, always the same
For all time... whoa lunchtime... for all time
Sometimes I look backwards to
Dig up the past
Finding myself in the dark
Heading nowhere, fast
And sometimes we still fail to see
Beyond the heart
What was is and will always be
Worries me
Oh my I turn the pages
The hands of time, the dust of ages
Is it true, or false is it true, or false
Tell me someone please, cause I need to know
I see the whole world, tossing and turning
The whole world, killing and burning
The whole world, never learning
All the land will ??
? sight of blood
There goes Issac Newton
We never learn our lesson
