Peg Leg Peggy Lyrics

I got a girl, her name is Peg
She looks kind of pretty but she's got a wooden leg
She's got a leg shaped like the leg of a chair
But when it comes to dancing, no one can compare

Peg Leg Peggy, she really knows how to hop
She really knows how to hop
She really knows how to hop
When it comes to dancing she's the queen
She sounds just like a sewing machine
Peg Leg Peggy, she really knows how to hop
She really knows how to hop
She really knows how to hop

She's got a sister's got a mouth so wide
Eats her dinner with the plate inside
When she sings you think her face is gonna split in two
She sings four part harmony while she's kissing you

Wide Mouth Winnie, she really knows how to kiss ya
She really knows how to kiss ya
She really knows how to kiss ya
When it comes to kissing, she's an ace
But make sure you don't get lipstick all over your face
Wide Mouth Winnie, she really knows how to kiss
She really knows how to kiss
She really knows how to kiss

Wide Mouth Winnie, she really knows how to kiss ya
She really knows how to kiss ya
She really knows how to kiss ya
When it comes to kissing, she's an ace
But make sure you don't get lipstick all over your face
Wide Mouth Winnie, she really knows how to kiss
She really knows how to kiss
She really knows how to kiss

Winnie's got a friend who's got four eyes
Two in the middle and one on each side
When you take her to the movies, it's really swell
She can look into your eyes and watch the film as well

Four-eyed Fannie, she really can flash those eyes
She really can flash those eyes
She really can flash those eyes
When you take her to the movies, you'll nearly die
When you kiss her ears, you look her right in the eye
Four-eyed Fannie, she really can flash those eyes
She really can flash those eyes
She really can flash those eyes
