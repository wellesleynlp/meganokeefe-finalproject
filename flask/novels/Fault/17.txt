This Too Shall Pass Lyrics

[POSTED BY TOOL]


I don't jones for nothing
cause that's a waste
waste of space in my frontal lobe and
I just sit, deal with it, don't have a fit
do you know what I'm sayin'?
I just get as down as I can
don't look to relief from a troubled young man
just take a piece
sometimes it sucks
Oh I'm not too sure if I can do this on my own guys
like I'm thinking maybe we should form a support group
or perhaps a church sponsored youth group
oh and then and then I say
I looked the other way
I changed my point of view
and here's what I do, one time, check it out
This too shall pass
this too shall pass
this too shall pass
this..
all the good times, all the bad times
face it bro, they all will pass
Your problems will seem inconsequential and trivial
when you realize one thing
were just a speck of dirt on this golf ball
called earth
so get stupid and sing
And then I feel stupid for even saying it in the first place
cause this ain't no woosies anonymous
right Chad?
that's right
Chad says no, so
fuck it up
Oh, and didn't then I see
I looked the other way
I changed my point of view
and here's what I do
This song is past
yeah
so put that in your pipe and smoke it
