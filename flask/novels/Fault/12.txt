The Postulate Lyrics

If i wrote a book...
Started a group
And every time you heard my name
Someone tried to control you
And all the wealthy praised me as
They drew more blood for affluence
And every time a bomb went off
My name was used in its defense...

Would i be despised?
Would i be ignored?
Or would i be the most accepted thing in the world?

And i pray every day
For the praying to end
And i'm sorry to say that
We've been deceived, my friends
Again and again

If both sides of every war

Used me to rally support
And every name brand racism
Believed my words were at its core
And every cruelty in the world
Was made possible by the view
That put its victims outside my grace
And held its sources as my truth...

Would i be despised?
Would i be ignored?
Or would i be the most accepted thing in the world?

And i pray every day
For the praying to end
And i'm sorry to say that
We've been deceived, my friends
Again and again
