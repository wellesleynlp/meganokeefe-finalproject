Check the Record Lyrics

Why?

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

Say who got the microphone's a force to be reckoned with
A complicated rhyme, a jaw breaking mechanism
All they can second is the motion to submit
Surrender to the vibe at the crack of a whip
I got my back equipped with a stack of equipment
Attacking all corners, it's an accurate description
And act relaxed, I pack a laxative prescription
With absolutely no action left in this system
It's all up here, and all around the atmosphere
Covered by what's left of this brown patch of hair
Now watch me push me out with a forceful release
And get the party going on from Boston to Greece

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

A giant leap, hop a hop, we drop another beat
Sleep, walk and talk and eat, cough it up and keep
Your feet, if you don't bluff enough, it often may defeat
The purpose altogether lead you off into retreat
How sweet it is to rock the mic without a grief
Agreed it could be sweeter with the freedom to breathe
And I can see that we're leaving a seed and we're feeding belief
If you support the microphones and believe in mc's, say:

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

Now everybody's out to get a piece of the pie
But here's a little treat only we could supply
Another steeple to fly over cerebrally
My moment indeed has arrived
And all the people can try to act
Equally live with a permission to promote
Their catches, but the catch is, keep the fish in the boat
The relief is enormous all over the place
From the ceiling to the corners, all over your face
Now take the money, create the money, making money
It's all for the sake of money, say goodbye to sacred money
Your flagrant money taking naked money clothes
Cause those who have the least always giving the most
That's how it goes, instant added prose
The last four bars of my systematic flows
And since the planet goes around the same star
We might as well revolve the beat back and raise the bar

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it

Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
Who got the microphone support?
Check the record
We got your microphone support
Check the record
Now records are forever
Take your microphone and check it
