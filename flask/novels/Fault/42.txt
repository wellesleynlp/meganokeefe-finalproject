Magpie Lyrics

PATRICK: magpie, was it you who stole the wedding ring? or what other thieving bird would steal such hope away? magpie, I am lost among the hinterland, caught among the bracken and the fern and the boys who have no name

MARIANNE: there's no name for us

PATRICK: still we sing

MARIANNE: and still we sing. little boy, little boy, lost and blue, listen now, let me tell you what to do. you can run on, run along, alone or home between the knees of her; all among her bracken and her ferns and the boy will have a name

BOTH: we will sing

MARIANNE: and we will sing

MARIANNE: one for sorrow

PATRICK: two for joy

MARIANNE: three for a girl

PATRICK: four for a boy

MARIANNE: five for silver

PATRICK: six for gold

MARIANNE: seven for a secret, never to be told
