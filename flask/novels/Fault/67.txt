Once Were Romans Lyrics

First Cohort... In battle formation" - Roman general

Once were Romans - Once were men who died for honor - Once were women who made imperial blood
Once was glory you could only bleed - Once were gods who walked upon the earth - Once was truth...
Once were Romans

Bind this world forever - Bind the truth forever

Barbarians at the gates of Rome - Seek to stop the impossible
Evolution of man, Civilization - Advancement into the evil

Consilio et animis - Fortes Fortuna iuavat
Veritas vos liberabit - Credite Posteri

Roma Victrix!

Consilio et animis - Fortes Fortuna iuavat
Veritas vos liberabit - Credite Posteri

Once were Romans
Once were men who died for honor - Once were women who made imperial blood - Once was glory you could
Only bleed - Once were gods who walked upon the earth - Once was truth... once were Romans

Bind this world forever - Bind the truth forever

From the foundation of Romulus... To the conquests of Caesar...
From Augustus' triumphs... To the mighty Scipio & victories of general Agrippa

Roma Caput Mundi!
