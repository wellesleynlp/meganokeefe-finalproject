What Actually Happened? Lyrics

I, uh, knew a man who once sent a letter to a mail channel that he'd raped his girlfriend and he's now a recovering rapist, attending an incest survivor's twelve step program. And the girlfriend, now ex, is in a support group for women who've been raped

What actually happened?

"She was passed out asleep on the couch after we'd been drinking. I woke up in the middle of the night horny so I fucked her. She didn't wake up; I told her about it in the morning. She was furious! 'You raped me!' she said."
