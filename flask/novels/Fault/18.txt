P.S.A. (Written by Brian Francis Taylor) Lyrics

[Verse 1: Matt Easton]
At a time when the competing political rhetoric of our nation has never been more polarized
I find that honest conversation with others produces more agreement than difference
The majority finds middle ground on most issues
Then you turn on the news
We hear cries from one side who fight most for the social righteousness that we each hold to be self-evident
Are the same who support a suppressed and restricted marketplace
From the other side we hear those who assure a fiscal balance
Tend to be the same who support social suppression and restrictions
Whether they like to admit it or not
See, For those of us who see the world as neither Black nor White
We are the Grey Area
We are a Group. A Mindset. A Movement
We believe in the freedom to swing out fist so long as it does not make contact with a fellow human
We believe that compromise produces a collective strength, as opposed to the selfish, who view it as an individual weakness
We believe balance and moderation is key in every aspect of life
We believe in understanding, acceptance, and empathy
Only though interactions with others can the movement transcend rhetoric
Live in the Grey Area, do not simply praise its ideals
All you control is your mind and your movement
So change your mind and start a movement
This is Grey Area
