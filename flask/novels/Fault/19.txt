The Way To Crash Lyrics

I awake with a new sense of restless desire
For the things I can't have without crossing a line
And it kills me to know that I'd trade this sickness over the truth of you

And it seems we would come to appreciate
All the things that stay with us everyday
But we only see what moves
And I can't help but notice this new view

Maybe no one will understand me like you could
But I need more than to be understood
The way to crash is to stay in the same direction for good

There's a thirst and a rat with a leech on its back
That was made to attain what can't be sustained
And the feelings decay, but the hunger remains
And it drives me to my grave

Maybe no one will understand me like you could
But I need more than to be understood
The way to crash is to stay in the same direction for good
