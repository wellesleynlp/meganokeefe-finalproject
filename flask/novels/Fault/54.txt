A Song for Christmas Lyrics

A Song for Christmas

Words & Music by Joseph Patrick

Christmas?. can be a lonely time of year my friend
And when the times get tough
And ? don?t even have enough for a card to send
Well you can always do the best that you can

(Chorus)
So I bring you a song for Christmas
May love be with us in our hearts
And may joy and true happiness take part

Christmas ? sometimes I wonder what it?s all about
And though I?ve had my doubts
Maybe that ray of hope can come shinin? through
And this old world can be a better place for me and you

(Chorus)
So I bring you a song for Christmas
May love be with us in our hearts
And may joy and true happiness take part
