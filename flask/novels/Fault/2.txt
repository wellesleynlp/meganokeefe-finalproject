John Deere Green Lyrics

They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Ah, paint it green boy

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
