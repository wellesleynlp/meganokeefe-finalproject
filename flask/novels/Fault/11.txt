Murder Groupie Lyrics

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

All those letters of yours
Ever feel this lonely
You simply got to believe
I'm your one and only

My puppy-eyes will make you take that place
If you love me you will help set things straight

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie

Your support and affection in the world to me
I need your trust, desperately

Fatal life of yours could stand out frill
If you love me, then precious - kill, you will

Wanna change your filling stock
As you prey a sitting duck
Your resistance is will

I read you like an open book
If you love me, then precious - kill, you will!

Aah, be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie

Wanna change your filling stock
As you prey on a sitting duck
Your resistance is will

I read you like an open book
If you love me, then precious - kill, you will

Be mine
Be mine
Be mine

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie

Be
Be my
Be my mur-
Be my murder
Be my murder group
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie!
