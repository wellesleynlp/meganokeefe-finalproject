Five Fingers Lyrics

I smoke five fingers
In an Egyptian jail
The following singers
John… Bob… Leonard and Neil
Forever on my trail

I left my mummy
In the Valley of Kings
His voice is haunting me
In my head he sings

Dance with me Egyptian girl
I’m looking at you
With the eyes of the world
On Tahrir Square
With your pretty black dress
I see your eyes and yes yes yes

Let the window open
In the pale moonlight

I was looking at the green eyes
The green eyes of my bride

I smoke five fingers
In an Egyptian jail
The following singers
John…Bob… Leonard and Neil
Forever on my trail

Dance with me Egyptian girl
I’m looking at you
With the eyes of the world
On Tahrir Square
With your pretty black dress
I see your eyes and yes yes yes

I smoke five fingers
In an Egyptian jail
