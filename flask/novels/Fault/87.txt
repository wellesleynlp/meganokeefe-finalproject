Life Support Lyrics

I'm your pastor
On the verge of a disaster
From my mind and it's cold
I'm all alone
Drown my soul in the water

Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Turn me off this life support oh
Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Take me off this life support oh

Relese him
He said his dream is to kill him
Or so I'm told
I've made a flood
From spillin blood in the water

Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Turn me off this life support oh
Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Take me off this life support oh

Time keeps falling down
Time keeps falling down

Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Turn me off this life support oh
Why can't I die
Why can't I die
Take me off this life support oh

Take me off this life support
Take me off this life support
Take me off this life support
