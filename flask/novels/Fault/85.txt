Life (Support) Lyrics

Your dog has lost his tag and now he has no name
Your mobile phone drink deep of vodka and shame
Watching you as you move
I see you panicking in your locked room
It took me a lifetime to realise you were just an actor
A curtain twitcher's feast
I lie down in incoming traffic and I make my peace
It took me a lifetime to realise I was just an anchor
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
A gap to fill in your gill
Wrap it up as a pill
I got down on your lap steel
Just me and the crows and the garden fence
Searching for hard-earned recompense
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
A broken racket machination
Like a madman masturbating in the train station
Circuitous defeat
Deafening sideways rush
Still standing grimace
As I collapse to the floor
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
Somebody turn off the life support machine
Somebody turn off the life support please
