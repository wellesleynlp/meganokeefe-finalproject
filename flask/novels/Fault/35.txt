The Twilight Showdown Lyrics

Spurs on both his mighty infant tears of our oil
Prince Augustus
Pasta with the lack of razor crowned a princess
Biding off aside, I must distance the rival
Tell you something
Shouting with her brass conduction
Prince Augustus. Sond the trumpet
Welcome to the twilight showdown!

Fighting with his eyes, combusted
Prince Augustus
Shouting with her head of mustard
Welcome to the twilight showdown!
