HOW WILL I KNOW IF PEOPLE SINCERELY LIKE ME???
WILL ANYONE LIKE ME AS SINCERELY AS YOU?

Papyrus prepares a non-bone attack then spends a minute fixing his mistake.
Papyrus is cackling.
Papyrus whispers "Nyeh heh heh!"
Papyrus is rattling his bones.
Papyrus is trying hard to play it cool.
Papyrus is considering his options.
Smells like bones.
Papyrus remembered a bad joke Sans told and is frowning.
Papyrus is thinking about what to wear for his date.
Papyrus is thinking about what to cook for his date.
Papyrus dabs some Bone Cologne behind his ear.

Papyrus dabs MTT-Brand Anime Powder behind his ear.
Papyrus dabs MTT-Brand Cute Juice behind his ear.

You can't improve on perfection.
You give the cheapest gift of all... Friendship.
You give 35 G because you can't think of an appropriate gift.
You give your remaining money because you can't think of a better gift.
Gyftrot refuses your gift.
Hey now. You aren't made of money.
Hey now. You aren't made of friendship.

I wanted this to be a fair fight.

Unless your kindergarten teacher...

Killing you now is an act of mercy!
So STOP being so damn resilient!
What the hell are humans made out of!?

Undyne bounces impatiently.
Undyne flashes a menacing smile.
Undyne draws her finger across her neck.
Undyne holds her fist in front of her and shakes her head.
Undyne towers threateningly.

Undyne is letting you make the first attack.
DEF This time, don't hold anything back!
You pretend to swing at UNDYNE with all your might.
I've been defeated... My house is in shambles...
I even failed to befriend you.
That's it.
I don't care if you're my guest anymore.
One final rematch! All out on both sides!!!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN REGAIN MY LOST PRIDE!!!
NOW COME ON! HIT ME WITH ALL YOU'VE GOT! NGAHHHH!!!

wht
What.
That's the best you can manage?
Even attacking at full force...
You just can't muster any intent to hurt me, huh?
Heh, you know what?
I don't actually want to hurt you either.
At first, I hated your stupid saccharine schtick, but...
The way you hit me right now, it...
Reminded me of someone I used to train with.
Now I know you aren't just some wimpy loser.
You're a wimpy loser with a big heart!
Just like him...
Listen, human.
It seems that you and ASGORE are fated to fight.
But knowing him...
He probably doesn't want to.
Talk to him.
I'm sure you can persuade him to let you go home.
Eventually, some mean human will fall down here...
And I'll take THEIR soul instead.
That makes sense, right? Fuhuhu.
Oh, and if you DO hurt ASGORE...
I'll take the human souls... Cross the barrier...
And beat the hell out of you!
That's what friends are for, right?
Fuhuhu!
Now let's get the hell out of this flaming house!

So even THAT power... It wasn't enough...?
Heh...
Heheheh...
If you...
If you think I'm gonna give up hope, you're wrong.
'Cause I've... Got my friends behind me.
Alphys told me that she would watch me fight you...
And if anything went wrong, she would... evacuate everyone.
By now she's called ASGORE and told him to absorb the 6 human SOULs.
And with that power...
This world will live on...!
Monster Kid quivers anxiously.

truthmusic
My body... It feels like it's splitting apart.
Like any instant... I'll scatter into a million pieces.
But...
Deep, deep in my soul.
There's a burning feeling I can't describe.
A burning feeling that WON'T let me die.
This isn't just about monsters anymore, is it?
If you get past me, you'll...
You'll destroy them all, won't you?
Monsters... Humans... Everyone...
Everyone's hopes. Everyone's dreams. Vanquished in an instant.
But I WON'T let you do that.
Right now, everyone in the world...
I can feel their hearts beating as one.
And we all have ONE goal.
To defeat YOU.
Human. No, WHATEVER you are.
For the sake of the whole world...
I, UNDYNE, will strike you down!

It's... um... it's...
This is a work in- progress, so don't judge it too hard...
But, you know how Mettaton always faces f-f-forward?
That's because there's a switch on his backside.

And, umm... press th-th-th-the switch...
He'll be... um... He'll be...

No, no, it's time to go~
...well... maybe ONE little nibble~~
Just kidding, of course~
If you don't mind being gobbled up~ Ahuhuhu~
Ahuhuhuhu~ Well, I don't mind keeping you here~
Feeling comfortable trapped in that web?
It's time to go~
Ahuhuhu~ What are you doing~
Why so pale? You should be proud~
Proud that you're going to make a delicious cake~ Ahuhuhu~
Let you go? Don't be silly~
Your SOUL is going to make every spider very happy~~~
You're scaring off all my customers!
Oh, how rude of me! I almost forgot to introduce you to my pet~
It's breakfast time, isn't it? Have fun, you two~
The person who warned us about you...
Offered us a LOT of money for your SOUL.
Looked like a total nerd.
They had such a sweet smile~ and... ahuhu~
She was very adamant I run away with her~~~ Ahuhuhu~~~
It's strange, but I swore I saw them in the shadows... Changing shape...?
She even left a route for me to escape from~
Oh, it's lunch time, isn't it? And I forgot to feed my pet~
With that money, the spider clans can finally be reunited~
She said she would block off the rest of Hotland after I followed her~
You haven't heard? Spiders have been trapped in the RUINS for generations!
Foolish nerd~ A spider NEVER leaves her web~
(Except to sell pastries~)
Even if they go under the door, Snowdin's fatal cold is impassable alone.
Ah, but I do feel a little regret over it now...
But with the money from your SOUL, we'll be able to rent them a heated limo~
Yes, I should have wrapped her up when I had the chance~
And with all of the leftovers...? We could have a nice vacation~
Or even build a spider baseball field~
She looked like she would have made a juicy donut~~~
But enough of that... It's time for dinner, isn't it? Ahuhuhu~
Don't look so blue, my deary~

...I think purple is a better look on you! Ahuhuhu~
You're trapped in a strange purple web!
You're still alive? Ahuhuhu~
Oh, my pet~ Looks like it's time for dessert~
Huh? Where did you get that...?
Did you steal it?
Oh, my pet~ It's time to show them what we do with thieves~
Huh? A telegram from the spiders in the RUINS?
What? They're saying that they saw you, and...
...that this is an error message!?
...even if you are stingy, you never hurt a single spider!
...even if you hurt others, you never hurt a single spider!
...you helped donate to their cause!
...you were really passionate about spiders!
...you're a total spider fanatic!
They say even if you are a hyper- violent murderer...
You never laid a single finger on a spider!
Oh my, this has all been a big misunderstanding~
I thought you were someone that hated spiders~
The person who asked for that SOUL...
They must have meant a DIFFERENT human in a striped shirt~
The person who warned me about you...
They really had no idea what they were talking about~
Sorry for all the trouble~ Ahuhuhu~
I'll make it up to you~
You can come back here any time... And, for no charge at all...
I'll wrap you up and let you play with my pet again!
Ahuhuhuhuhuhu~ Just kidding~
I'll SPARE you now~

We've grown so distant, darling...
How about another heart-to-heart?

A.. arms? Wh... who needs arms with legs like these?
I'm still going to win!
Come on ...!
The show ... must go on!
Dr... Drama! A... Action!

L... lights... C... camera...
Enough of this! Do you really want humanity to perish!?
...or do you just believe in yourself that much?
Haha, how inspiring!
Well, darling! It's either me or you!
But I think we both already know who's going to win.
Witness the true power of humanity's star!
...then...
Are YOU the star?
Can you really protect humanity!?
Smells like Mettaton.
Monster seems satisfied.
Mettaton has low HP.
METTATON EX
DEF His weak point is his heart-shaped core.
You say you aren't going to get hit at ALL.
Ratings gradually increase during Mettaton's turn.
You posed dramatically. The audience nods.
Despite being hurt, you posed dramatically. The audience applauds.
Despite being wounded, you posed dramatically. The audience gasps.
With the last of your power, you pose dramatically. The audience screams.
You turn and scoff at the audience.
They're rooting for your destruction this turn!
dsf
H.. ha...
So I was wrong.
Darling...
You really are strong enough to get past ASGORE.
Well then...
It's time for you to go.
Don't worry about me.
I might seem like I'm dying now, but...
Dr. Alphys can always repair me.
And... besides...
Even if I'm not cut out to be a star...
I still got to perform for a human, didn't I?
So, thank you, darling...
You've been a great audience!

OOH, LOOK AT THESE RATINGS!!!
THIS IS THE MOST VIEWERS I'VE EVER HAD!!!
WE'VE REACHED THE VIEWER CALL-IN MILESTONE!
ONE LUCKY VIEWER WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO ME...
...BEFORE I LEAVE THE UNDERGROUND FOREVER!!
LET'S SEE WHO CALLS IN FIRST!
blc
HI, YOU'RE ON TV!
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ON THIS, OUR LAST SHOW???
sadmett
.....
oh........
hi... mettaton...
i really liked watching your show...
my life is pretty boring... but...
seeing you on the screen... brought excitement to my life... vicariously
i can't tell, but... i guess this is the last episode...?
i'll miss you... mettaton......
...oh.... i didn't mean to talk so long...
oh..........
NO, WAIT! WAIT, BL...
H... THEY ALREADY HUNG UP.
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER CALLER!!!
Mettaton, your show made us so happy!
Mettaton, I don't know what I'll watch without you.
Mettaton, there's a Mettaton-shaped hole in my Mettaton- shaped heart.
AH... I...
I SEE...
EVERYONE... THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DARLING.
PERHAPS... IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF I STAY HERE FOR A WHILE.
HUMANS ALREADY HAVE STARS AND IDOLS, BUT MONSTERS...
THEY ONLY HAVE ME.
IF I LEFT... THE UNDERGROUND WOULD LOSE ITS SPARK.
I'D LEAVE AN ACHING VOID THAT CAN NEVER BE FILLED.
SO... I THINK I'LL HAVE TO DELAY MY BIG DEBUT.
BESIDES.
YOU'VE PROVEN TO BE VERY STRONG.
PERHAPS... EVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO GET PAST ASGORE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROTECT HUMANITY.
HA, HA...
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST, ANYWAY.
THE TRUTH IS, THIS FORM'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS...
INEFFICIENT.
IN A FEW MOMENTS, I'LL RUN OUT OF BATTERY POWER, AND...
WELL.
I'LL BE ALRIGHT.
KNOCK 'EM DEAD, DARLING.
AND EVERYONE... THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT AUDIENCE!
Ohhhh my.
If you flipped my switch, that can only mean one thing.
You're desperate for the premiere of my new body.
How rude...
Lucky for you, I've been aching to show this off for a long time.
So... as thanks, I'll give you a handsome reward.
I'll make your last living moments...
ABSOLUTELY beautiful!

AHHHHHHH!!!!!
AHHHHH!!!
Oh! Whoops! That hurt!
So sorry, I must have gotten in the way!
I really shouldn't stand so close
Ah I'm just being troublesome
Darn it, I keep getting in the way
So sorry, I'm such an oaf
Wandering in front of you...
Are you... trying to KILL me?
...so sorry, but I've had a really tough year.
I don't know if I could take you killing me on top of everything.
You should find someone else to kill. So sorry.
?????
I just said I'm not interested in the offer!!
...
Sorry, I must not have enunciated clearly enough.
I am not interested in being killed. Thank you very much.
Look, stranger
I... I guess I'm going to have to tell the truth.
My whole life, I've never been worth a lot of EXP.
Everyone else at my work, in my classes,
Would raise a person's LV by 4 or 5 when destroyed...
But me?
I wouldn't even increase your LV at LV 1.
For this reason... I... I've always been...
I've never been very good at getting killed. So...
I'm flattered that you... Want to destroy me.
But you are making a big waste of your time!!
Stop killing me!!!
OK, OK. Hm.
If you stop killing me, I'll pay you 200G.
220G?
300G?
W... Wait a second.
You trying to kill me... C... could it be...?
Because you don't like me very much...?
No, no, that can't be!
This is just a friendly, um, killing between acquaintances!!!
Pals... we're... we're still pals, right!!
OK, maybe not PALS, but, uh,
Friendly strangers?
You know, just one step away from being buds!!!
I mean, I was practically...
I was about to crack open the sparkling cider!
Pull out some baguettes and some swiss cheese!
BLOW ON A FREAKING PARTY HORN!!!
N... no, you don't like me either, huh...?
Nobody likes me... they're just putting up with me
I'm just annoying you... I should just leave
ARRRRRGHHHH!!! Why am I such an idiot??!?!!!!
How did I not see it before!!!
You weren't killing me because you LIKED me!!!
NOBODY does that!
That's NOT a thing!
Oh. Sorry. I was being too loud. Ugh.
I'm wasting your time, aren't I...?
...whew, I feel really... strange.
I think I need to go home and lie down.
Oh, I'm so sorry! How clumsy of me... I've bumped into you
I'm such a klutz.
I was just here to find something to draw, and...
Oh no, it's ok! It's OK!
I'll give you a gift to make up for your troubles.
Let me look in my vest!
Ummm, I couldn't find anything I want to give away.
Wait, wait!
I've got my notebook!
I can draw you a picture in it!
I'm quite the artist, you know.
I'll draw you a GREAT picture!!!
S.. sorry... The drawing didn't come out very well.
Wait! I know the problem!
I just have to find a better piece of paper for it!
None of my papers are good enough to use...
IT'S OK!!!
I know what I can do!! I'll use my magic pencil!
It has to be under some of these papers somewhere!!!!
Here! I got it!
