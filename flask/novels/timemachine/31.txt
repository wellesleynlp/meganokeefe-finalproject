The Horror Lyrics

(Time, time, time, time, time)
Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world
Time, time, time, time, time to understand the monster. (Monster, monster, monster, monster.)

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

(Time, time, time, time, time)
Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world
Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

I will amuse myself with terror and murder...

From what grave did I come?
Of what evil mixture was I compounded?

I have time, all the time I need to put an end to you

You've come to find me, to destroy the monster. (Monster, monster, monster, monster)

I am real!
(No, no, no) no one
No one is safe

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.)

(Time, time, time, time, time) Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world
Time, time, time, time, time to understand the world. (3x)
