- - - THANK YOU'S - - -Words cannot accurately express the gratitude I feel towards the Universe for
Selecting me to become a character such as “B.o.B” and have the opportunity
To impact worldwide consciousness. I would also like to take this time to give
Credit for the parents who were courageous enough to give birth to a wild son
Such as myself, Bobby Simmons Sr. and Karen Simmons
Although I am the face of the movement, there is always a proper team
Behind any successful project. B-Rich, TJ Chapman, and Playboy Tre have been
Like uncles for me on my journey and constantly make sure that I’m grounded
We have put in a lot of blood, sweat, tears, pain, happiness, and patience into
What is unfolding and now we can celebrate the release of the debut album. I
Am grateful to have a team to invest so much time and energy into one project
HAM SQUAD ON DECK!!! SKLOOO!
Tiffany, first I have to thank you for all of the creative ideas and concepts that
You have given me out of the pure love for art. Secondly, I have to thank you for
Staying in my corner through my roughest times because if it were not for you
B.o.B would be lost
Since a year ago I have prayed that the Universe would bring musicians in
My life who were just as passionate about music as I am…well those prayers
Were answered which is why I am privileged to be working with awesome
Musicians such as Kyle King, Takehiko Kato, Arielle Simmons, and DeLarry
Sanders. Whether on the road or in the studio, the chemistry is divine
There have been very crucial bits of information and advice that I have
Received throughout my journeys into the Universe but the most impactful ones
Have come from my brother Jamaal. Thank you for listening to my horrible raps
Back in the day…now they’re not so bad eh? Gracias!
Stephen Hill - Although you are my cousin, you will always be my brother in
My eyes. From the days that we were sneaking into clubs, to the days that we
Were the Klinic, all of this started as a dream and has manifested into something
Way greater than what we envisioned. I have to express and acknowledge my
Gratitude for you inspiring me to be greater as a man and STAND UP! Lol
The Simmons Family
The Hill Family
Jim Jonsin - You have taught me so much in the studio and have shown me
How to really put my elbows into a record!! lol. I would like to thank you for
Believing in B.o.B since we walked into that studio in Miami that day! Rebel
Rock!!!!!
LaTrice Burnette - C’mon Son!!!!! You are one of the hardest working people
That I know alone! You go way over and beyond to make sure that me and
Team B.o.B are okay and we will always have a place in our hearts for you
You will always be family to us!
Sydney Margetson - Getting the word out to the masses about the existence of
B.o.B is something that would not have been possible without your contribution
To the project. It takes actual care and effort to pull that off. Thanks
Brian “Busy” Dackowski - Obviously from the name, you are always busy
Making sure we have the best looks, and the best ideas in this new age of
Internet and technology. So on behalf of myself and Team B.o.B…Thank you!
