$outhside Lyrics

I'm Draped Up and I'm Dripped Out, Yo main bitch is my chick now
Candy paint so sexy when my speakers start to kick out
No mask on but yall know That I Be hittin' licks now
Blowin' dro while I'm riden by and I don't care what yall talkin' bout
Go ahead and give my name a shout, Cuz yo Sister gettin' Dicked down
Texas where I'm livin now, 254 thats K-Town
Fuck you and yo gay frown, Got a smile on and a Gold Crown
7 bottles of that blue dot, so I'mma let my problems drown
Yeah I smoke that Cheech and CHong, Yeah, I'mma hit the bong
Got a thick mistress and you know damn well she pop her thong
This my song, Turn it up and rap along, Goddamn that thrax is strong
The rap game where I belong, Drinkin' beer whether its right or wrong
Eyes so low it look like I'm from Hong Kong
On my grind from Dusk to Dawn, By that time I'm too gone
Just for weed 5 Grand Withdrawn, but I gotta quit
Other wise I'mma be in the pen, Fuck that I'd rather fuck 2 twins
By this time next year I'mma win, Fuck the color of my skin
When you hear my wicked flow, It'll make yo head spin
Mixin' juice and Gin, Driven drunk with my friends, Thats Kush Squad
And we the shit, to legit, for yall and ya tricks
Mama told me never snitch, And I already Knew that shit
Why do yall think yall so slick, We know yall ain't sellin' bricks
I think yall be suckin' dicks, So fuck you and yo fuckin' Clique
My home boys be Too Rich, $outhside I love this shit

I love this Shit, $outhside I love this shit

Fuck you and yo Clique, Cuz $outhside I love this shit

Yall know I love this shit, IM GONE
