The Traveller Lyrics

I am a traveller
And I'm arriving
In a new place
With a new face

So don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Don't look behind you
You don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
They'll never find you

I am a traveller
Across the ocean
I wanna get there
I wanna swim in your emotion

So don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Don't look behind you
You don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
They'll never find you

I am the traveller
Across a million miles of open
I wanna get there
I wanna swim in your emotion

I won't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Won't look behind you
They won't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Until they find you

I am a traveller
I am a traveller
I am a traveller
I am a traveller
Traveller
Traveller
