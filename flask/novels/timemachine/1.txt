Hope Diamond Lyrics

[VERSE 1]
So the priceless blue diamond is cursed
And we both got hurt
Maybe I stand in a minefield of words
But I asked you first

[PRE-Chorus]
Those early encounters with the hurtful lies of kids
I remember what you did:

[Chorus]
Covered your arms in a curtain-shawl
Bloodied your palms on the elementary wall
If it seems too far, it is

[VERSE 2]
I was out there in the cradle of thorns
When your fears took form
And the truth is maybe youth is a wall
But it's not that tall

[PRE-Chorus]
If you want me, you show me in a most unusual way
In a most unusual way

[Chorus]
Under the eyes of a frozen lake
I saw your fire and it served me not to wait
But it hurt me all the same

You had to chase an electric storm
You had to wait for the violent wind to call
And it carried you away
