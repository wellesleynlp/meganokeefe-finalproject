Chemicals (King of the Carp) Lyrics

I am the cunning prince of thieves
I am the nagging bite of teeth
I am the tightest skirt unraveling
And the kiss upon your cheek

Most lies, can put a man in a woman's burning fuse
Closed eyes, can save a man from a woman's taste of fruit
As long as you refuse to believe in the power, of cold showers
You'll continue to excuse the receiving end of cowards

I swear to the few who drowned in doubt
And I've come here to warn you
For the ghost can see you now

Chemicals and cannibals
This kiss becomes medical, yeah
Chemicals and cannibals
Well this kiss becomes medical, yeah

Fire up the engines
We're getting lost in her hair
I can smell the sulphur burning sweet sex in the air
Adrenaline and hormones become the pendulum inside your bones

As long as you refuse to believe in the power, of cold showers
You'll continue to excuse the receiving end of cowards
As long as you refuse to believe in the power, of cold showers
You'll continue to excuse the receiving end of cowards

Adrenaline and hormones become the pendulum inside your bones

Chemical and cannibals
This kiss becomes medical, yeah
Chemicals and cannibals
Well this kiss becomes, medical
