One Foundation Lyrics

[Intro]
Got to build our love on one foundation

[Verse 1]
There will never be no love at all
There will never be no love at all
Got to put aside them segregation
Got to put aside them organization
Got to put aside them denomination
There will never be no love at all
I mean there will never be no love at all

[Verse 2]
Got to build our love on one foundation
Got to build our love, let us build our love
On one foundation, on one solid foundation
Got to build our love on one foundation
Or there will never be a single drop of love
You won't have no freedom now

[Verse 3]
Got to come together
We are birds of a feather
We got to come together
Because we are birds of a feather
Got to come together
Because we are birds of a feather
Or there will never be no love at all
There will never be no love at all
We also got to realize we are one people
Got to realize that we are one people
We got to realize we are one people
Or there will never be no love at all
There will never, never, never be no love at all

[Outro]
Got to build our love on one foundation
