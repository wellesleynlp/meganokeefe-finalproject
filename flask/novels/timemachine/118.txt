In the Dark Lyrics

Capture here a moment
You know less if u don't notice
The way the moon shines down on us tonight
Dont be so afraid to open up when its so obvious
That you and I are beckoned by this light

Because you can fool yourself into wanting something
Else
But you'll be running back to see me
You can play this game
While memories remain
I know you're holding out for something real

Because you can see a spark somewhere in the dark
But only when its gone will you feel it
You can feel a star
Something's in your heart
But only if you try to believe it

So take a minute of your time
Reflect on your life
See how it feels living life alone again
And I know you're afraid
To see yourself in that way
But everytime you try
You step back in the light again

Because you can fool yourself into wanting something
Else
But you'll be running back to see me

You can play this game
While memories remain
I know you're holding out for something real

Because you can see a spark somewhere in the dark
But only when its gone will you feel it
You can feel a star
Something's in your heart
But only if you try to believe it

Why'd you keep your love from me?
Why were you hiding out from me?
Come to me
I need you close
I need your everything the most
So give to me

Because you can fool yourself into wanting something
Else
But you'll be running back to see me
You can play this game
While memories remain
I know you're holding out for something real

Because you can see a spark somewhere in the dark
But only when its gone will you feel it
You can feel a star
Something's in your heart
But only if you try to believe it
