In Need of Medical Attention Lyrics

Sing a song confessional
For the heart, mind and spirit
For the medical professional
Who isn't here to hear it
Who is not here to hear it
I was at the funeral
Eighth or ninth in the procession
Now it ain't all that unusual
To lose a month or two to depression
In desperate need of some medical attention
In desperate need of some medical attention
In desperate need of some medical attention
