Peking Saint Lyrics

In Peking
There is a son who
Is much greater
Than you want to be

Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would of guessed that
It was not a real body part?

In Peking
There is a mother
Who is laden
With who she has to be

Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would of guessed that
It was not a real body part?

In Peking there is someone who
Is who they should exactly be
