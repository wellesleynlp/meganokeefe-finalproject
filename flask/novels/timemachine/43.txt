Rap Sheet Lyrics

My Criminal Career Started Around '93
I Was Young And Thugging And Just Tuff As I Could Be
With A Chip On My Shoulder Plus A Mean Demeanor
It Got A Little Meaner When My Hand Touched The Nina
It Was All Black With A Fucked Up Handle But I Loved It. Mack Took Me To The Roof And Showed Me How To Bust It
I Was Open! When That Shit Went Bdllat And I Emptied The Clip And The Hammer Jumped Back Since Then I Slept Wit It Washed Up In The Tub With It And I Was Kinda Broke So Niggas Got Stuck Up With It
Me And My Man Bucks Went On A String Of Armed Robberies, Then I Got Knocked For Them String Of Armed Robbery's
Fast Forward 96 Im Back On The Strip
Its Looking Good Niggas In The Hood Fucking With Them Bricks
Copped The Tech And The .380 Like Who Want It
Snatched Up 100 Grams And Went Straight To New London
I Put A Crack House On That Connecticut Strip
It Wasn't Easy I Went To War For That Connecticut Strip
I Took That Block From A Nigga
Who Was Raised There I Ain't Care Man I Had To Move Weight There
I Don't Play Fair, Hollow Tips Will Leave You Laid There
I'll Snatch Your Kids Out The Day Care
But Then London Got Hot I Had To Fall Back Some Shit Happened I Can't Even Say On Wax (Can't Talk About It) Im Back In The Hood Again Like Yeah Whats Good Again
Niggas Frontin Gotta Make My Gangsta Understood Again
I Opened Up On Toppend Put Dimes On Toppend Niggas Snitchin Sendin One-Time To Toppend The D's Rushed The Crib Yellin “freezeä With They Gats Out I'm Caught Red-Handed With The Coke In The Addicts House. Sittin On The Island Now They Trying To Finish Me. I Bailed Out Hooked Up With Killa The Rest Is History
