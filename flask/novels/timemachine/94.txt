To The Foundations Lyrics

I've got to get myself together, yeah
Can't afford to let my faith go, you know
Whenever Jah sun comes shining
And my sisters are all smiling
No one is dying, my people aren't crying

We are living in the love of the Father
Living in the house of the Almighty, yeah
We are living in the love of the Father
Living in the house of the Almighty, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ohh

The days of destruction will never be, oh no
Not hard to the wise man who will see
Yet the fool thinks he knows it all
'Cos here comes later he stumbles and falls
He goes down for a reason, Jah is giving him a beating

To the foundation he'll have to go down
To the foundation, chant him down
To the foundation he'll have to go down
To the foundation, ohh, ohh, oh yeah
Ooh yeah, oh I said

The days of destruction will never be, oh no
Not hard to the wise man who will see
Yet the fool thinks he knows it all
Here comes later he stumbles and falls
He goes down for a reason, Jah is giving him a beating

To the foundation he'll have to go down
To the foundation chant him down
To the foundation he'll have to go down
To the foundation, oh yeah, oh yeah
To the foundation, yeah
To the foundation, oh
