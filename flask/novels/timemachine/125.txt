Traveller Lyrics

Hey mister travelling man don't turn
It's in your blood you can't deny it... no
From all your sacrifice you learn
Unlock your silent scream and shout it... loud
Sometimes the words rhyme and dreams come true
But time is the devil creeping up on you
Bleed your heart traveller
Give your soul and travel
Travelling brother travelling sister
Sing the song of the travelling man
Well come on now gypsy queen let's dance
Release your wildest wind of fire... yeah
Life might not bring another chance... no no
So join the rootless lonely drifter
One day is beautiful the next one cries
We stay on these crumbling roads untill we die
And still we try
Bring your soul traveller
Keep your heart and travel
Travelling brother travelling sister
Sing the song of the traveller
It's in you blood traveller
Move on and travel
Travelling brother travelling sister
Sing the song of the travelling man
Tracks in the frozen snow will melt away
New summe rwinds will blow
Just like the midnight sun we burn our flame
Old sins cast long shadows they will remain
And bring us pain... yeah
Hold on Traveller
Keep your soul and travel
Travelling brother travelling sister
Sing a song for me
Move along traveller
Be strong and travel
Father and brother
Sister and mother
Play a song for the travelling man
Go on and travel
Travelling man
Ooh Travelling man
Move on and travel... travel
