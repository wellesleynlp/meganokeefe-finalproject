Burial Lyrics

[Verse 1: Cee]

Northern wind blows, I feel it in my bones
The arctic chill something colder, it's freezing my soul,
I kinda like the snow, I love to see it fall
When it lands on my palm, feels like I'm 8 years old
Nearly 30 and having my second childhood
The sun still shines in the winter so man, I'm wild good
Goddamn I'm almost feeling like it's summer again
But all these cold dark months really got me wondering

[Verse: Dallas Green]

When will this winter end?
The snow’s been falling for months
The town all dressed in white
And my skin is burning from the wind

The cold sun in disguise
An assault from the morning light
My burial, I can’t succeed
Frozen and paralyzed

[Hook: Cee & Dallas Green]

[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Got these heavy clouds hovering here
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] You have me freezing like half of the year
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] I gotta keep my mind from the dark moods
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Maintain and keep sane until the sun's due

[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Ya got these heavy clouds hovering here
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Ya have me freezing like half of the year
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Yo I gotta keep my mind out of these dark moods
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Maintain and keep sane until the sun's due
[Dallas Green] Oh no

[Verse 2: Cee]
16 bars
All this time, chillin', locked in the basement
My vitamin D levels declining, gotta replace 'em
I don't even really bother to open the blinds now
I know it's always dark out so I just stay inside the house,
Motivation is low, my energy is gone
I keep my mind busy with business, money or writing songs,
Leaving the crib is a hassle
I got like 14 layers to put on, or homie, I'mma freeze my ass off
Silk told me that the folks that live in colder climates
Achieve more in life because mother nature is less inviting
So I keep that in mind, and while the verses scribed
Detailing my life, I'm always thankful for where I reside
I've barely seen the sun in well over a year
And by now I'm going crazy, son, I need a break from being here,
Just some degrees in high teens with wide seas
And palm trees and fresh, clean, warm sand under my feet, I'm like

[Hook: Cee & Dallas Green]

[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] I think I can see an end to this
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] This shit can make anybody a pessimist
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] The barometer moving out of the depths and shit
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] The clouds is bailing now, I think this is a blessing kid

[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] I think I can see an end to this
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] This shit will make everybody a pessimist
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] Barometer moving out of the depths and shit
[Dallas Green] Oh winter
[Cee] The clouds is bailing now, I think this is a blessing kid
[Dallas Green] Oh no

[Verse 3: Cee]

It's kinda warming up, snow is melting fast
White sheets turned to brown slush on the pavement and
People smiling and, the mood is lifting man
The down jackets gone and women showing skin again,
Patio furniture out and the sun staying later
The trees is green and the squirrels is rocking aviators
Spring is here and the cold has finally disappeared
We've risen from our burial, yo winter, see you next year
