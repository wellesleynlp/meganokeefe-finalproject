The Resurrectionist Lyrics

Crossing Blackfriar's Bridge to Guy's
Then back to Bart's for a better price
Our goods are dear but they're never shoddy
Tell me: anybody need a body

From a resurrectionist?
Medical scientist
We've all got to earn ourselves a living
All it takes is a little bit of digging
By a resurrectionist

I met a man down Thieving Lane
He told me he was in the same game
We both talked the same body language
On Newgate Street we saw the hanging

Of a resurrectionist
Medical scientist
We've all got to earn ourselves a living
All it takes is a little bit of digging
By a resurrectionist

Got a nice thing for the right punter
He used to be a fogle hunter

We had a drink then a couple more
At the King of Denmark and the Fortune of War
A handsome lad lay in a Hansom cab
Soon to be a stiff 'un on the slab

From a resurrectionist
Medical scientist
We've all got to earn ourselves a living
All it takes is a little bit of digging
By a resurrectionist

We don't bring them back to life
But we do bring them back
From the dead
