Project Lyrics

Take it now !
Go !

I make my best for my motherfucking, for my motherfucking life
I have so much to give, but I have nothing to lose
I don't wanna be a pawn
I rise, I grow, give to the core

Project !
I'm working hard on my project
Know that everyday I live for my project
I'm working hard on my project
I'm living, I am living, living for my Project !
Project !
I'm working hard on my project
Know that everyday I live for my project
I'm working hard on my project
I'm living, I am living, living for my Project !

I, I meditate, and I stand back from my like and my way
I meditate, I meditate, I meditate...

Disillusion, exploitation, and corruption
I try to find da way to get through
Desillusion, exploitation, and consumption, I use my

Integrity (x5)

Integrity's power

I've been a long long time to become really strong !
I live for my music, you, can't bring me down !
I cannot be manipulated, cause I'm not your puppet !
My music is a stand up fight, from the underground !
Don't stop me ! Don't judge me ! Don't treat me ! Like a child !
You can suck my dick, and go hang yourself !
Sometimes business is just like a war !
I rise, I grow, and I give to the core !

Project !
I'm working hard on my project
Know that everyday I live for my project
I'm working hard on my project
I'm living, I am living, living for my Project !

Project ! Project ! Project ! Project !

It takes vision and courage, yes it takes vision and courage, yes it takes
Vision and courage, yes it takes to create !
...PROJECT !!!
