Stars Lyrics

There's sun shining all of the time
Yeah, sun's shining all of the time
Time, time, time, time, time

And sometimes I'm all on my own
Sometimes I'm all on my own
Time, time, time, time, time

If I took a page from your book
It's gonna be page number nine
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Time, time, time, time
Sun's shining all of the time
Sun's shining all of the time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
