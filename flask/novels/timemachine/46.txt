The minecraft project song Lyrics

Back in 2011 a legend was born
Who would've known this day would come? Newcomers do be warned
We spent so much time watching you learn the ropes
And turn the coast upside down in Minecraft
Your project, with love, was soon adorned
I remember staying up late watching every episode
You said the goal was to have fun, you built a home
While learning some new tricks everyday
You'd give us laughs and entertain
And I can't believe it's gone!
All the memories I kept
But is he finished? No he's yet to be, I bet!
He's got something in store
He's been entrusted to soar
After The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
We will cherish these days
Cuz the attention you gave
To the Minecraft Project!
Yo, I thank you Syndicate
Provided ample rides and abided with time, I'm fin to get
The rape train together, we'll engage haste and whether
Or not it's replaced now, we'll never forget
We'll praise it forever, let's go!
Do you remember when he started up the mushroom farm?
When he went on diamond exploring ventures, close to harm
Bows and all, shooting Creeper crouds and slicing Zombies down
Enticing how you just keep getting better, Syn you brought the storm
Let's not forget his loyal wingman Jimmy the dog
How he introduced us to techno sheep within his farm
I remember way back before enchantments, still a contender then
Still took on all the mobs, befriended Endermen
You took us to the Nether, no one can measure up to how
You kept us guessing every installment, no surrender man
Every season increased and now you're Feeding the Beast!
And I can't believe it's gone!
All the memories I kept
But is he finished? No he's yet to be, I bet!
He's got something in store
He's been entrusted to soar
After The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
We will cherish these days
Cuz the attention you gave
To the Minecraft Project!
He went from building simple houses to an epic castle
Grew from a kid with a dream, I'm proud of his eclectic channel
Doubt his mantle will be topped, no one will grapple onto what he's got
He handled the Ender Dragon, it's reign had stopped
The content overflowed, this fanbase, he acquired quickly
My favorite episode? When he discovered Fyre City
Tire, did he? No, he expired gritty foes
He flew higher, simply rose
And then we witnessed the entire thing explode
April Fools, you surprised us you crazy Riot Lion
I laughed so hard when the gravity gun made those pigs go flying
Or when the lighthouse just got sucked up to the moon
Tom you struck us with your mood
And I can't believe it's gone!
All the memories I kept
But is he finished? No he's yet to be, I bet!
He's got something in store
He's been entrusted to soar
After The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
We will cherish these days
Cuz the attention you gave
To the Minecraft Project!
Everyone, it's time we join to say our last goodbye
But not forever he's just begun and from here he'll fly
TheSyndicateProject will see no end, it's chronic
The Never Forgotten will have his Welcome Home
Never cease to fight
With us this journey will seldom finish, simply put
The Minecraft Project will go down in Youtube history books
It's risky but let's do our best to let the rest know
Our favorite series must go
I can't believe it's gone!
All the memories I kept
But is he finished? No he's yet to be, I bet!
He's got something in store
He's been entrusted to soar
After The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
The Minecraft Project!
We will cherish these days
Cuz the attention you gave
To the Minecraft Project!
