Judgmental Lyrics

[Verse 1: Justus]

All my exes were all lessons, I call em' mistakes
I learned from all of em', they made me who I am today
So lonely I..
Continue to look for the next
I try and give em' all of my respect
I catch em' in a lie then I regret
Pretty much all of what I said
I still get em' up to my bed
My practice is up, I had plenty of reps
So I have no trouble tryna flex
Can't remember all the names I met
So when you see me girl refresh
All my thoughts, we can hop on my jet
Just name a place, any continent
I'll ease your mind, relieve yo stress
Forget your man and that's a bet
There's something there, how we connect
Like nobody, yeah Keith Sweat
Got your body soakin' wet
I caught you like I threw a net
No I'm caught up in a mess
You tellin' me I was yo best
I only hit it once and I was swingin' for the fence
And yeah I'm makin' dollars, so to you I'm makin' sense
But..
I suggest you don't forget
I suggest you don't forget

[Hook]

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

[Verse 2: Justus]

So much for being optimistic
I often have a chance at love but I always miss it
You callin' me and tellin' me you miss my kisses
But when I'm with you all we do is fight, you always bitchin'
You worry about the wrong things not too mention
You livin' in the past with you there's no forgettin'
I know I did my dirt and left you hurt
You smelled that fragrance on my shirt
And you assumed that it was her
Things were rough and didn't work
I knew I broke that heart apart
Thought you had me from hello but it was over from the start
It was hard, that wasn't our plan
You went and found another man
It didn't work out so you came back asking for a second chance
And I declined, I needed time to myself
I was in a bind, I wasn't sure how I really felt
I went out with my dogs it was the only thing that helped
They showed me a good time and they helped me realize
Then I started hittin' women on the regular
You sit at home cryin' wonderin' if I think of ya
But babe I wish the best for ya
I won't forget ya
At least for now

[Hook]

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

[Verse 3: Justus]

Now I got my new girl angry
For the fact that she can't ever change me
She try and blame me but really she should blame you
You made me this way I hope your happy boo
You coulda been my girl
You coulda had the world
But you chose to step, chose to step
And now I get around and you hear about it
Until there's no one left, no one left
It's mandatory I see that
They hand it to me
I got no game it's just some girls that understand my story
Every time I pop a bottle all I think is you
We are just a sad story but you changed my view
Be careful who you give your heart too
I might just keep it to myself cause that's the smart move
I gotta learn to live with regrets
But now every girl I meet I neglect
Even the ones I ain't met
They feel that I'm short and lacking respect
I'm scared to get hurt every girl is a threat
And I judge em' for they even make a sound
No love lost no love found

[Hook]

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town

I been played too many times to try and settle down
Tomorrow isn't promised so I'm livin' for right now
I know you heard them stories about how I get around
I know you also heard I was the man of my town
