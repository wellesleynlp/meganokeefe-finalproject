Robot Love Lyrics

I want to please my maker, my master, my creator
Where ever you go, I come along
I obey your orders, they sound so strong
I have no blood, no heart, no vains
My electronic system is my brain
I don't eat, I don't sleep
A loss of power makes me weak

You give me life, I give you joy
You give me life, I give you joy

You made me what I am
A lady robot for a madman
Arms of iron, legs of steel
There's no human warmth to feel
Sex makes all my fuses blow
Kiss me and my oil will flow
My lips are cold, my eyes are red
You made my earrings out of led

You give me life, I give you joy
You give me life, I give you joy

You turned me into a lovemachine
You call me names you are so mean
I'm full of chips and you're my user
You make me come on your computer
My pussy works like a vibrator
That's how you want it, that's how you made her
When your digital orgasm is done
You switch me off and then you're gone

You give me life, I give you joy
You give me life, I give you joy
