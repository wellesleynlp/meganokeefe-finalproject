Traveller Lyrics

The life I have
Is the life I've always wanted
And there's no more feeling low...
Early morning, and I'm on the go!
Here I'm finally on the road...
On the road!

And I wanna put my faith in you babe
But I have to face it in another way
Let go...free from all
Now I'm a traveller...traveller...travel around

But don't worry baby I need someplace to call my home
...never worry baby I need someone to call my own
RIGHT!

And I wanna put my faith in you babe
But I have to face it in another way
I wanna put my faith in you babe...
So let go...free from all
Let go...I'll free fall
Now I'm a traveller...traveller...(travel around!)
...traveller... traveller...(travel around!)
...traveller... traveller...(travel around!)
...TRAVELLER...TRAVELLER...TRAVEL AROUND!
