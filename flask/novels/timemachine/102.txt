The Devil's Hall Of Fame Lyrics

[Music: Finn Zierler]
[Words: Finn Zierler & Jorn Lande]

Surrender
Lost in the dark
Without angels to guide me Hands of death reaching out for me
I'm longing to rest
I see myself move in need of power Time will mend
Ease the sorrow
Take my hand
There's no tomorrow I've looked straight into the eyes of demons rising
So close
I've had one foot on the other side
For so long I've seen evil
So evil that all living died
The devil is near You may fool the people
But you can't fool me
No more
Not anymore Time will mend
Ease the sorrow
Take my hand
There's no tomorrow And all the souls turned black
There is no way back No! Bronto cyber
Spiritech dicus La dominus pratos
Mutantus spiritus Stranded with the darkness
It's so cold in here I feel the rush within
Within me Time will mend
Ease the sorrow
Take my hand
There's no tomorrow
