Crash Lyrics

Here is what I said
Made up is his blanket
Up above our heads to
Satisfy the masses lost

This is a present
The gift-wrapped, hollow story sent
Made in man son man
The elemental spiritless

What have we become?
A better fitting graces
Makeshift housing a medical nightmare
What have they done?
A tipping over cowardice
Fleeing from the wrong side
The body with the hive

What have we become?
A better fitting graces
Makeshift housing a medical nightmare
What have they done?
A tipping over cowardice
Fleeing from the wrong side
The body with the hive

Crash!
Nowhere left to run

Wake up Neverland
A never-ending worry
Walking hand-by-hand
And overtaken by the sweat
What have we become?
So wrapped up in the blanket's hum

What have we become?
A better fitting graces
Makeshift housing a medical nightmare
What have they done?
A tipping over cowardice
Fleeing from the wrong side
The body with the hive

What have we become?
A better fitting graces
Makeshift housing a medical nightmare
What have they done?
A tipping over cowardice
Fleeing from the wrong side
The body with the hive

Crash!
Nowhere left to run

Crash!
Nowhere left to run

Note the afterbirths
Needles my forgiveness
But opium's excesses
From sitting on the grasses green
Who then holds the gun?

[various gunshots]

Crash!
Nowhere left to run
