We Do (The Stonecutters' Song) Lyrics

[All]
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?
We do! We do!

[Karl]
Who leaves Atlantis off the maps?

[Lenny]
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

[Alien]
We do! We do!

[All]
Who holds back the electric car?
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?
We do! We do!

[Skinner]
Who robs cavefish of their sight?

[Homer]
Who rigs every Oscar night?

[All]
We do! We do!
