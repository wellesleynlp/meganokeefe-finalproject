Traveller Lyrics

Existential matters ignite in circulation
A motion to bend, towards the swift end
Encompassing a visionary plead to defend

Liberation of the five senses, the ego phrase
Metamorphosis of perceptual principles
Platonic illumination of Natures' quincunx
Which hemisphere is mine to hold?

Traveller of the x-scape, through endomorphism of time
Hybrid existence - through spirituality endures the reality
Traveller of the x-scape, through the gravisphere of wisdom
Hyper potency - the predominant endurance through infinity

The iridescence of the solar glimpse
Through the eyes of Himm and Hippo
Just another sole strike of the sun
A stone in the hand or the thought of it?

Traveller of the x-scape, through endomorphism of time
Hybrid existence - through spirituality endures the reality
Traveller of the x-scape, through the gravisphere of wisdom
Hyper potency - the predominant endurance through infinity

Thoughts of a thinker
Infinity of numbers
Numbered thoughts
Thoughts of infinity

"Numbers are the essence of all things and the metaphysical
Principle of rational order in the universe" (Pythagoras)

Liberation of the five senses, the ego phrase
Everlasting metamorphosis of perceptual principles
