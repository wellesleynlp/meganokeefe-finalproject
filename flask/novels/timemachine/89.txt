Apocalypso Lyrics

In nolan time sign what does the mind cover?
Are we talking? White is the winter
Care-line, care-lines thumped it up
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing, on her swing

Black waves come and so fear me, december sinking...

In nolan time I've lost all my pure feelings
The psychiatrist posing as psychologist
When fear predicts then doubly the mind suffers
Are we talking? White is the winter
Care-line, care-lines thumped it up
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing, on her swing

Black waves come and so fear me, december sinking...
Waltz with me, courageously, we're dancing, dancing

We will not die, our days are multiplied and I'm happy again

Care-line, care-lines thumped it up
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing, on her swing
