Queen Lullabye Lyrics

I'm traveller of the Moon, if you see my map vanishing come back soon
She's around and it's clean, she ain't know what I mean, I'm traveller of the Moon
I'm traveller of the Sun, if you see my hand on the run
If you ring to the Moon angels back too soon, I'm traveller of the time

Oh, father, father of time, please don't cry, please don't cry
Your mother, she's still fly in your mind and in my mind
Oh, your mother, she is crying
