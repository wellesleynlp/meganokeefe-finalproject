Astral Traveller Lyrics

And in the ruins of the balloon
Stood a man with glasses held high
Wondering when to do it again
Have another fly into the sky
Somewhere flying high

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load

Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in the end (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wonderous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load

Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in the end (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wonderous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load
