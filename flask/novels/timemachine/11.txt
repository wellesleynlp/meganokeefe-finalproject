Endangered Species Lyrics

Nightmare of death strikes us all
Precaution to prevent disaster
In the grip of fear mistakes are made
And paranoia becomes the master
We cannot trust the senile fool
Who rules our petty nation
We put our faith in technology
To save us from obliteration
In the race to win priorities lost
Victory assured at what cost?
Defense network spread far and wide
Works off human sacrifice
Radiation that leaves us dead
Won't harm circuits encased in lead
Countries of the world are robbed of life
Battles are waged by satellites
Machines are given full reign
Electronic soldiers feel no pain
If they win who's to gain?
Your fate is sealed by emotionless steel
Laser beams striking down
Premonitions of death for those on the ground
Man has created his own misery
What a bloodthirsty creature he has turned out to be
The earth lies stagnant in radioactive decay
Man is now fading away
Victims of the holocaust live in fear
For they soon know another war will be here
Machines are given full reign
Electronic soldiers feel no pain
If they win who's to gain?
Your fate is sealed by emotionless steel
Machines in power their purpose decreed
Annihilate the enemy
The humans that remain want the war to stop
They just can't turn the damn things off
Robot soldiers stalking the plains
Striking down the humans that remain
Rebuilding armies on the assembly line
So we can go to war one more time
