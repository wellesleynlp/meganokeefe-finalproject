Sweet Jivin' Mama Lyrics

Did you ever know a woman with a red ....... smile
Did you ever know a woman with a red ....... smile
Sometimes you thought she ought to be buried alive

When a woman act right she's sweet as sweet can be
When a woman act right she's sweet as sweet can be
A sweet talking woman made a chump out of me

I got a sweet woman, she sure got me on the floor
I got a sweet woman, she sure got me on the floor
She hears me coming, get her husband out of doors

Sweet jivin' mama, make a man done gone and...
Sweet jivin' mama, make a man done gone and...
But a jivin' woman, make a man...

My friends done tell me, don't listen to no woman talk
My friends done tell me, don't listen to no woman talk
But a sweet jivin' mama make me stuff my friends and walk
