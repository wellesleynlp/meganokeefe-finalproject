Illumination Lyrics

You can begin your deep breathing now
Said...

Project, project
Mankind has endured many catastrophies
But none so great as the one which faces it today
The economic crisis past the gate has brought inflation
Imbalance and chaos to the every corner of the globe
Some label it the great recession, others are calling it...
