None Like You Medley Lyrics

I worship You, Almighty God
There is none like You
I worship You, oh Prince of Peace
That is all I long to do
I lift my hands for You are my righteousness
I worship You, Almighty God;
There is none like You

[None Like You:]

[Chorus:]
There is none like You
No one else can touch
My heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long and find, there is none like You

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
There's just something about that name
Master, Savior, Jesus
Like the fragrance after the rain
Kings and Kingdoms
Shall all pass away
There's just something about that name
