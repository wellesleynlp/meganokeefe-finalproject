They Swallowed The Sun Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They burned the world
And swallowed the sun
They take from everything
And care for no one
They study our rage
So they rattle our cage
But when they were gone
That's the day we came of age
But what can you say
When the loam and the foam has all been boiled away
And the oceans are dust
You walk for five days to the mountains of rust
And where can you go?
This land is forsaken and nothing will grow
And all the gods know
That the suffering of Earth makes a pretty good show
Somehow we survived
We hunted we thrived
The first to eat
We were always the last ones to die
We conquered a world
While they waited below
Molten tracks in the snow
Return to the Masters too well did we know
The locks off the door
Detritus of science is heaped cross the floor
This junk only works when the power is on
For five hundred years the grid has been gone
Electronic art
Ended up lasting as long as a fart
But that's what you get when you love with no heart
Bending to ending as soon as it starts
They created life
It should never be that way
A bill for you to bear that they never meant to pay
They went underground
It was really rude
Because they took all the girls and the guns and had food
Stem cells and cloning and fucking an ape
But it's not enough I must reach beyond
Commune with the LoiGoi and become a God

[Chorus]
They swallowed
We followed
They swallowed
They swallowed the sun
They swallowed
We followed
They swallowed
They've only just begun

[Verse 2]
The children were born
The children they died
When you live in the wasteland
Only the strong will survive
Remade the race
With the science of sin
Create a creature
We all can join in
We know where they are
We hunt them by night
They are dead by morning
Our schedules are tight!
Twenty hot chicks for every old man
That was the plan, the chicks would eat spam
Or maybe pink slime
I don't know what they cal it but they eat it all the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Viagra amd meth
And stem cells and death
They sucked on the stock-pile til there was nothing left
Vampiric cybernetic harbinger of hate
Ain't power great?
Remade the race
With the science of sin
Create a creature
We all can join in

[Chorus]
