Black dragon fighting society Lyrics

[Intro]
Yeah I drink juice when I'm killing cause it's fucking delicious
Hiding in the portrait our atomic stun
When I get the dirt we'll come all-ly lution ?

[Chorus]
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

[Bridge]
Stretching out my style free find my own blood
Better bought their soul but they think it's a dud

[Chorus]

Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa

1-2-3-4
Bass!
1-2-3-4

Hiding in the portrait our atomic stun
Take me to a time of come all-ly lution

[Chorus]

Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa

[Outro]
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
