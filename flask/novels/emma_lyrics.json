{"101377": ["Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "Ulysses (Chap. 12 - Cyclops) Lyrics\n\nI was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\n\n\u2014Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J.

The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R.

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.

And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai!

It\u2019s in our blood.\nA team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D) (vo)\nThere\u2019s a storm inside of us. I\u2019ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river.

AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.\n35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.\n3A.\n\ufffc\nLOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.\nNOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.\nShah\u2019s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.\nA very worthy opponent.\nRIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.\nThey are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.\nShah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.\nWhere is he?\nSHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?\nThe women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.\nA 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.\nGULAB GULAB\nPlease, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes\nmushkil no ghowaro\nTaraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.\nSHAH\nHave you spoken with the\nAmericans?\nAFGHAN MAN Please! No!\nSHAH\nAya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?\nAFGHAN MAN\nMehrabani/lutfan! Na!\nGulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.\nYou lie! Please!\nTARAQ\nAFGHAN MAN\nTARAQ\nTa Dorogh wayee!\nAFGHAN MAN\nMehrabani/lutfan!\n4.\nHe\u2019s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man\u2019s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he\u2019s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.\nTaraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.\nTaraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.\nTwo of Taraq\u2019s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.\nShah backlit. Ignoring the man\u2019s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.\nTight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand.

The recon team is Dietz, Comms. Axe, Nav. Luttrell, Medic.\nHEALY\nObjective of this mission is to positively identify Ahmad Shah.\nShane\u2019s head in his hands, pissed he is not going...a grainy photo of Ahmad Shah on a large color monitor. PowerPoint.\n13.\nKRISTENSEN\nThis is the best picture we have of him. It\u2019s current.\n(MORE)\n13A.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT'D) We know Shah killed fourteen\nMarines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.\nClear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.\nThe SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.\nAXE\nGo back...freeze.\nAxe studies an image of Shah.\nAXE (CONT\u2019D) No earlobes.\nMURPHY What\u2019s that?\nAXE\nThe guys got no earlobes.\nSilence as the team studies the image.\nSHANE\nearlobes for anyway?\nDIETZ\nand balance.\nSHANE\nDIETZ\nI heard earlobes are key for head\nbalance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he\u2019s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...\nLUTTRELL\nFalse. Earlobes have no biological\nfunctions for humans. Fish can use earlobes like a valve to open or close the ear canal.\nWhat are Piercing Balance.\n14.\nSHANE\nWhy would a fish want to let water\ninto his ear canal?\nLuttrell shoots him a look - \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d\n14A.\nMurphy keeps things moving.\nMURPHY\nBad guy. Senior Taliban commander\nresponsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.\nAXE\nThe helo pilots are going to do two\nfalse inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I\u2019m estimating it\u2019s gonna take us about two hours to complete.\nMURPHY Luttrell - medical\nLUTTRELL\nFirst things first, win the fight.\nThere\u2019s no medicine in a gunfight. It\u2019s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.\nDietz stands up, starts talking comms\nDIETZ\nCrypto will be wide band, segment 2-\n4. Murph\u2019s got a SAT phone. Region is very steep so expect typical comms problems. We\u2019ll be on two hour comms windows.\n(MORE)\n15.\nDIETZ (CONT'D)\nIf we miss two windows I\u2019d say wake somebody up. Other than that, don\u2019t\nsweat it.\nMurphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.\nMURPHY AC-130 is with us?\n15A.\nDietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.\nDIETZ\nCorrect. Just for the infil. All\ncomms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she\u2019s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we\u2019re halfway through infil, it\u2019ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.\nDanny chucks the toy plane.\nMURPHY\nReaction Force is the following:\nThe 47\u2019s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.\nMurphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.\nKRISTENSEN\nThat\u2019s correct. You\u2019ll have fifteen\nteam guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we\u2019re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we\u2019re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.\nThe toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT\u2019D) The movement is so we can get the\n47\u2019s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.\nMURPHY Roger that.\nLuttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.\n16.\nJAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\nAXE Lotta moving parts.\nMURPHY\nWhat we do, when we do, what we do.\nKRISTENSEN\nWe go in four hours.

Places the dead fly by his coffee cup next to three other dead flies.\nDIETZ I don\u2019t know.\nMURPHY Don\u2019t know what?\nDIETZ I don\u2019t know.\nWhat?\nMURPHY\nAXE\nHe\u2019s worried that he\u2019s losing\ncontrol over his castle.\nMURPHY Really.\nAXE Ask him.\nMURPHY\nAre you worried that you\u2019re losing\ncontrol over your castle?\nDIETZ Shut up Murph.\nMURPHY Are you?\nLUTTRELL\nHe\u2019s having control issues cause\nhe\u2019s the one whose always made the \u201ctaste\u201d issues in the family.\nDIETZ\nShe\u2019s got great taste.

He and Murphy are competing.\n18.\nMURPHY\nNot really. No. Marcus, you know\nwhat he means?

Got to let that\ngo bro.\nDIETZ\nIt\u2019s like this weird journey that\nshe\u2019s on. Moving through the house one room to the next.\nAXE Where is she now?\nDIETZ Kitchen.

Doing the math.\nThe kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he\u2019s still fast as shit.\nAXE Fuck me.\nHe charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.\nMURPHY\nI\u2019m thinking three ways this plays\nout.\nAll eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nWe let em go, we\u2019re gonna fight. So\nwe can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.\nDIETZ Three?\nAXE\nThree, soft Compromise. Terminate\nthe compromise.\nAxe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.\nMurphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.\nMURPHY\nCan we get a signal from that\nmountain?\n46.\nDANNY\nI thought about that. Probably. I\ndon\u2019t fucking know.\nMore dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.\nDANNY (CONT\u2019D) We gotta do something boss.\nMURPHY\nYea.\nMurphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What do you think?\nLUTTRELL\nThey don\u2019t seem to like us very\nmuch.\nMURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.\nAXE\nShah\u2019s down there. We let them go,\nShaw disappears. Mission fails.\nMURPHY What? Kill them.\nAxe stares at Murphy.\nMurphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.\nAXE\nWe are compromised Mike.\nMarcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.\nYea.\nShit.\nLUTTRELL\n47.\nMURPHY Danny?\nDanny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...\nDANNY\nI don\u2019t give a shit what you\ndecide. I\u2019m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You\u2019re the big bucks, earn em\u2019.\nMurphy turns to Marcus.\nMURPHY Marcus?\nLUTTRELL I don\u2019t know Mikey.\nLuttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.\nLUTTRELL (CONT'D)\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like it. We\nkill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...\nAXE Then what?\nLUTTRELL\nI\u2019m just saying. It ain\u2019t gonna be\nprivate. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don\u2019t want that legacy, bro. I\u2019m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.\n48.\nAXE\nI\u2019m not either, but the\nOld man\u2019s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.\nLUTTRELL\nLet\u2019s just tie \u2018em up and get the\nfuck out of here.\nAXE\nWe tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.\nLUTTRELL\nThen let\u2019s just get the fuck out of\nhere.\nI will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.\nMURPHY\nYou want to kill, Axe? Really?\nThat\u2019s your position?\nAXE\nI want to be playing golf with\nFreddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I\u2019m having a little trouble getting a tee time.\nLUTTRELL\nIf we kill these kids, it\u2019s International news. CNN doesn\u2019t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That\u2019s the story. Forever.\nTight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.\nMURPHY\nAxe what\u2019s your call?\nAXE\n49.\nAxe stares at Murphy.\nAXE (sad grin)\nMy final answer?\n49A.\nMURPHY Your final answer.\nAXE Kill them.\nThis hits hard.\nMURPHY Danny?\nDietz stares at the tied up kids.\nDANNY It\u2019s your call bro.\nMURPHY\nYou don\u2019t have an opinion?\nDANNY\nYea I have an opinion. Two\nopinions. One is that for the record I don\u2019t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s our business.\nMURPHY What\u2019s two?\nDANNY\nTwo is, this is the Navy and you\u2019re\nthe boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I\u2019m fucking told.\nOk.\nMURPHY\nDANNY\nSo you tell me what to do and it\nwill be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.\nMURPHY\nMarcus what\u2019s your call?\nLuttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy\u2019s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he\u2019s the tie-breaker.\n50.\nON MURPHY.\nLUTTRELL\n(slowly shaking his head)\nNo. I\u2019d rather fight them straight up. I don\u2019t want to kill these kids.\nThinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.\nMURPHY (quiet)\nFuck me.\nMurphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.\nDANNY\nLook at them. They fucking hate us.\nWe don\u2019t know how many Hajji\u2019s they have down there. We can\u2019t let them go.\nLUTTRELL\nSo now you have an opinion? I\nthought you were standing by waiting for your orders?\nAXE\nThis opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I\u2019ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It\u2019s a cursed opp.\nMURPHY\nStarting to feel like a cursed opp.\nLUTTRELL\nIt\u2019s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That\u2019s all. Everyday man. Devil\u2019s asshole.\nAXE\nShah just killed twenty marines\nlast week and we\u2019re on him. We\u2019ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.\n(MORE)\n51.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nWe\u2019re letting him go and why in the\nfucking world does he have the right to do that to us?\nAxe is starring at LUTTRELL.\n51A.\nSilence.\nAXE.\nSeriously Marcus. Why does he have\nthe right to do that to us?\nLUTTRELL\nI don\u2019t see it that way.\nMURPHY\nSo what is your fucking call bro?\nLUTTRELL\nLet them go. Shut it down.\nSo if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it\u2019s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.\nThis is all on MURPHY.\nMurphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.\nMurphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Pack\nup. Everything. We\u2019re gonna let \u2018em go and we\u2019re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We\u2019re calling QRF and we\u2019re getting out.\nSilence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nDANNY Roger that.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nMURPHY Let\u2019s move it.\nQuick Shots.\nThe guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.\n52.\nThe older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.\n52A.\n41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41\nKristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.\nThe Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.\nCOMMS GUY\nSpartan 01, Spartan 01, over.\nKristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC\nKRISTENSEN\nWhen was your last contact with\nSpartan 01?\n42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.\nThe Apache pilots are firing up their engines.\nMusslemen comes out of a pilot station.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWhere are you guys going?\nAPACHE PILOT\nWe just got called North. By an\nArmy 372, evidently they took some small fire.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWe\u2019re QRF, bro.\nAPACHE PILOT\nThat\u2019s what we thought. BAGRAM is\nnow QRF.\nThe 47s?\nCorrect.\nAre we not the QRF now?\nAPACHE PILOT That\u2019s my understanding.\nMussleman is a bit confused...\nMUSSLEMEN\nAPACHE PILOT\nMUSSLEMEN\n53.\nApache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.\n43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43\n10 MINUTES LATER:\nGear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.\nMURPHY CONT\u2019D Everybody good?\nQuick nods from the team as Murphy\u2019s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.\nMURPHY\nYou three just won the lottery.\nSpeak well of us.\nAn odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.\nGo!\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nThe little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.\nThe old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.\nThen he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.\nMurphy looks at the team.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Let\u2019s move it.\nThe four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.\nThere is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.\n43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.\n54.\nLeaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid\u2019s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.\n43B UP TOP. 43B\nSlow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.\nOn AXE\nConstantly checking behind him.\nHis left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.\nAxe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.\nSprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.\nMurphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.\nYou ok?\nLUTTRELL.\nAXE Fucking Afghanistan.\nLUTTRELL.\nYea. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to\nbe falling.\nAXE I\u2019m fine.\nHe takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.\n43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.\n43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.\nAXE (CONT'D) I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s go.\nAxe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.\n55.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nMaybe we should just hike down to\nthe village, ask to borrow a phone.\nTight on Murphy\u2019s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe\u2019s ankle.\n44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44\nQuiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.\nTIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.\nVillagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.\nA couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.\nTRACKING with the two Taliban.\nAs they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.\nTaliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.\nShah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.\nQuick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK\u2019s, RPG\u2019s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.\nQuiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...\n45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.\nFuck.\nMURPHY\nHe\u2019s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.\nDanny?\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\n56.\nDietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.\nNothing.\nDANNY (on radio)\nAnvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.\nMURPHY Great.\nComms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.\nAll three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV\nNothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.\nThey cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.\nCUT TO:\n46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46\nDanny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.\nMurphy\u2019s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can\u2019t.\nHe\u2019s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it\u2019s blocking his signal.\nMURPHY (to mountain)\nMove Bitch.\nLuttrell\u2019s fifteen feet to his left.\nLUTTRELL What do you want to do?\nMURPHY\nGo home, get in bed, and watch\nAnchorman.\n57.\nCheck.\nLUTTRELL\nMURPHY I wanna be on you.\nLUTTRELL\nRoger that. Should I spread the\nword?\nMURPHY\nNot just yet. Let\u2019s hold up for an\nhour and see just how big of a can of hell we\u2019ve opened.\nLUTTRELL What do you think?\nMURPHY\nWe did the right thing. We let our\nlove light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn\u2019t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?\nLUTTRELL\nYou think they\u2019re coming after us?\nMURPHY\nLike a pack of wild dogs.\nMURPHY keys his radio.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What say you Axe?\nAXE (on radio)\nI\u2019m fine.\nMurphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.\nMURPHY (to Axe)\nYou good to go?\nAXE\nNo problems boss.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s the deal. Lay low here.\nSoon as the sun sets we move.\n(MORE)\n58.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nIf we can\u2019t get comms from that top we\u2019re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you\u2019re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.\n46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on\nthe glass.\nIt\u2019s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.\nON AXE.\nCalmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.\nTight on Luttrell resting.\nDanny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.\nMurphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.\nBack to Axe. Focused down range.\nDown the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.\nJust catches Axe\u2019s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.\nTHEN\nMore movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.\nStops whistling.\nAXE\u2019S POV:\nNo movement.\nAxe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.\nA HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.\nAXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see\u2019s more movement.\nThey are almost surrounded.\nTIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.\n59.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)\nSssst! Sssst!\nLuttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.\nSees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)\nTry and call it in.\nDanny desperate to get the radio to work.\nLuttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.\nLUTTRELL\u2019S POV.\nLined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.\nLUTTRELL looks left.\nMore Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.\nMore Taliban.\nThe SEALs are FUCKED.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nHow the fuck fast are these little\nbastards? All four SEALs guns up.\nMarcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?\nLUTTRELL\nI\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re about\nfixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.\nYea.\nMURPHY\n60.\nLUTTRELL\nLooks like I voted wrong.\nMURPHY\nNegative. We\u2019ve been given the\nopportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.\nLUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.\nON DANNY AND AXE\nLooking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.\nDANNY Do they see us?\nAXE Dunno.\nBACK TO MARCUS.\nHis back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.\nDanny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.\nAxe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.\nThe trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.\nA TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.\nA flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.\nLuttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.\nLuttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.\nMarcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.\nMarcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:\n61.\nA fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.\nHold.\nTHEN.\nLuttrell fires once. Blowing the man\u2019s head off.\nAn odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.\nStops.\nLuttrell shoots again removes what\u2019s left of the fighter\u2019s head.\nThe Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.\nFrom above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.\nScreaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.\nTaraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.\nON MURPHY.\nTaliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.\nA solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.\nThe SEALs are close to being surrounded.\nMURPHY checks his rear.\nMURPHY POV\nA cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.\nMurphy calls it.\nPush right flank.\nMURPHY\n62.\nAxe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.\nLuttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.\nDANNY\nSpartan 01 reporting major enemy\ncontact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.\nMurphy\u2019s doing the same with his SAT phone. He\u2019s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.\nDanny\u2019s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.\nHe tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.\nDANNY (CONT\u2019D)\nMarcus!\nLuttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.\nLUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.\nDANNY Roger that.\nTaliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.\nMURPHY\nDanny did you get the call through?\nDANNY\nI made the call. Don\u2019t know if it\nwent through. You?\nMURPHY\nI couldn\u2019t get a line.\nDANNY Fuck.\nMarcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.\nCharging the Ambush.\n63.\nMURPHY\nKeep pushing right. Kill \u2018em all.\nThe four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.\nThe Taliban close enough to see clearly.\nAxe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.\nTALIBAN POV:\nFrom behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.\nTwo more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.\nAxe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.\nDecent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.\nRazor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe\u2019s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.\nLuttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.\nFURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.\nDanny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.\nDANNY Goddammitt.\nPissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.\nDanny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.\nMURPHY Can you fight?\nDANNY Roger that.\n64.\nMURPHY\nWant me to take the radio?\nDANNY Negative.\nMurphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.\nMURPHY (yelling)\nAXE?!\nAXE Sir!\nMURPHY\nCan we break that flank? Hold\nthis, we\u2019re gonna push left!\nAxe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.\nAxe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe\u2019s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.\nHalf blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:\nAXE POV.\nTwo Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.\nThe Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:\nOne of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.\nLuttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.\nFrom the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.\nMarcus and Axe start moving left. Both shot during the move - Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.\n65.\n47 INT. TOC. BAGRAM 47 Comms guy at radio. Checking wall clock.

Thinking. Checking the clock.\nKRISTENSEN Call me if they miss two.\nCOMMS GUY Roger that.\n48 EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.\nA massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban flank.\nAXE Right is no good.\nMurphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into firing positions.\nMURPHY Fuck me.\nThe first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards. Covering them with dirt and rock.\nLuttrell swings his gun left and starts firing into the left Taliban position.\nMikey? Yea? You ok?\nLUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL MURPHY\nWe\u2019re good.\nA bullet slams in Murphy\u2019s lower stomach.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) This is no good.\n66.\nLUTTRELL Roger that.\nMURPHY\nCan we break that right flank?\nLUTTRELL Negative. We got to go left.\nMURPHY Negative.\nFrom downhill, two RPG\u2019s fire at their position.\nDietz takes a shot in his upper-right chest.\nA massive double RPG explosion. Tears away chunks of granite. Shrapnel cutting deep into all four SEALs. They are now clearly under attack from all three sides.\nLUTTRELL\nWe can take \u2018em Mikey but I\u2019m\nthinking we\u2019re gonna need a new spot.\nTight on Murphy.\nMURPHY Roger that.\nHe turns behind him giving that 50 ft. cliff a second look.\nThe Taliban gunfire is relentless now. Coming from all three sides.\nLuttrell, Danny and Axe returning constant fire. Reloading mags. Firing away. Marcus hit for the first time in his right ass cheek.\nTight on Murphy:\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) We gotta fall back.\nLuttrell looks at the cliff behind them.\nLUTTRELL You mean fall off.\n67.\nMURPHY\nRoger that. Fall off. Danny can you\nmove?\nDANNY No problem.\nAxe?\nMURPHY\nAXE Good to go.\nAs the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and start falling immediately. Danny\u2019s legs giving out, buckling as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.\nMarcus turns to Murphy.\nLuttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...\nThey fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.\n48A IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48A\nBone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off. The SEALs crash and bounce and flip. Finally settling hard on a reasonably flat part of the cliff. 300 yards below.\n48B SILENCE. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48B\nTight on Luttrell. Face down. The first to move.\nFace lifts. Nose clearly broken. Luttrell looks to his left.\nMurphy struggling to his knees. Broken teeth. Face shredded. To the right, Danny and Axe.\nMURPHY Hey Marcus.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nMURPHY That sucked.\n68.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nMURPHY\nI mean that really sucked.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nVoices screaming up the mountain.\n48C TOP OF 1ST CLIFF 48C\nTaraq is at the jump point looking down the steep cliff. Feels unsurvivable. Several fierce lieutenants flanking Shah.\nGo.\nSHAH\nDozens of Taliban start making their way down the steep cliff.\n48D AT THE BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48D Murphy, Marcus Axe and Dietz struggling to their feet.\nMURPHY\nFuck.\nLuttrell sees the blood pouring from Murphy\u2019s gut.\nLUTTRELL Let me see it.\nPulling up Murphy\u2019s shirt revealing a decent gut shot. Marcus looks for his med kit.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D) Lost my med kit.\nMURPHY Where\u2019s your gun?\nLuttrell looks down. To his left, then right. Spots his gun ten feet away in the dirt.\n69.\nLUTTRELL\nGod\u2019s looking out for us.\nMURPHY\nIf this is looking out for us I\ndon\u2019t want to see him pissed.\nLUTTRELL\nWe\u2019re doing good Mikey we just\ngotta...\nLuttrell interrupted by a series of severe incoming RPG\u2019s.

And that thing is drama.\n\nHis very words are action words. His interpretation of the English language is in terms of pictures. One act described in terms of another. Hence the rich metaphor and simile.\n\nThe metaphor is of course very primitive. It is easier to illustrate than it is to explain because action came before speech. Let us make a parallel. Language is like money. In primitive communities actual goods, however bulky, are bartered for what one wants. This finally evolves into coin, the coin being not real wealth but a symbol of wealth. Still later even coin is abandoned for legal tender, and still later for cheques in certain usages.\n\nEvery phase of Negro life is highly dramatised. No matter how joyful or how sad the case there is sufficient poise for drama. Every\u00adthing is acted out. Unconsciously for the most part of course. There is an impromptu ceremony always ready for every hour of life. No little moment passes unadorned.\n\nNow the people with highly developed languages have words for detached ideas. That is legal tender. \"That-which-we-squat-on\" has become \"chair.\" \"Groan-causer\" has evolved into \"spear,\" and so on. Some individuals even conceive of the equivalent of cheque words, like \"ideation\" and \"pleonastic.\" Perhaps we might say that Paradise Lost and Sartor Resartus are written in cheque words.\n\nThe primitive man exchanges descriptive words. His terms are all close fitting. Frequently the Negro, even with detached words in his vocabulary--not evolved in him but transplanted on his tongue by contact--must add action to it to make it do. So we have \"chop-axe,\" \"sitting-chair,\" \"cook-pot\" and the like because the speaker has in his mind the picture of the object in use. Action. Everything illustrated. So we can say the white man thinks in a written language and the Negro thinks in hieroglyphics.\n\nA bit of Negro drama familiar to all is the frequent meeting of two opponents who threaten to do atrocious murder one upon the other.\n\nWho has not observed a robust young Negro chap posing upon a street corner, possessed of nothing but his clothing, his strength and his youth? Does he bear himself like a pauper? No, Louis XIV could be no more insolent in his assurance. His eyes say plainly \"Female, halt!\" His posture exults \"Ah, female, I am the eternal male, the giver of life. Behold in my hot flesh all the delights of this world. Salute me, I am strength.\" All this with a languid posture, there is no mistaking his meaning.\n\nA Negro girl strolls past the corner lounger. Her whole body panging* [* from \"pang\"] and posing. A slight shoulder movement that calls attention to her bust, that is all of a dare. A hippy undulation below the waist that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power. She is acting out \"I'm a darned sweet woman and you know it.\"\n\nThese little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities, and no one ever mistakes the meaning.\n\n[Will to Adorn]\n\nThe will to adorn is the second most notable characteristic in Negro expression. Perhaps his idea of ornament does not attempt to meet conventional standards, but it satisfies the soul of its creator.\n\nIn this respect the American Negro has done wonders to the English language. It has often been stated by etymologists that the Negro has introduced no African words to the language. This is true, but it is equally true that he has made over a great part of the tongue to his liking and has had his revision accepted by the ruling class. No one listening to a Southern white man talk could deny this. Not only has he softened and toned down strongly consonanted words like \"aren't \" to \"ain't \" and the like, he has made new force words out of old feeble elements. Examples of this are \"ham-shanked,\" \"battle-hammed,\" \"double-teen,\" \"bodaciously,\" \"muffle-jawed.\"\n\nBut the Negro's greatest contribution to the language is : (1) the use of metaphor and simile; (2) the use of the double descriptive; (3) the use of verbal nouns.\n\n1. Metaphor and Simile\n\nOne at a time, like lawyers going to heaven.\nYou sho is propaganda.\nSobbing hearted.\nI'll beat you till: (a) rope like okra, (b) slack like lime, (c) smell like onions.\nFatal for naked.\nKyting along.\nThat's a rope.\nCloakers--deceivers.\nRegular as pig-tracks.\nMule blood--black molasses.\nThat's a lynch.\nSyndicating--gossiping.\nFlambeaux--cheap cafe (lighted by flambeaux).\nTo put yo'self on de ladder.\n\n2. The Double Descriptive\n\nHigh-tall.\nLittle-tee-ninchy (tiny).\nLow-down.\nTop-superior.\nSham-polish.\nLady-people.\nKill-dead.\nHot-boiling.\nChop-axe.\nSitting-chairs.\nDe watch wall.\nSpeedy-hurry.\nMore great and more better.\n\n3. Verbal Nouns\n\nShe features somebody I know.\nFuneralize.\nSense me into it.\nPuts the shamery on him.\n'Taint everybody you kin confidence.\nI wouldn't friend with her.\nJooking--playing piano or guitar as it is done in Jook-houses (houses of ill-fame).\nUglying away.\nI wouldn't scorn my name all up on you.\nBookooing (beaucoup) around--showing off.\nWon't stand a broke.\nShe won't take a listen.\nHe won't stand straightening.\nThat is such a compliment.\nThat's a lynch.\n\nThe stark, trimmed phrases of the Occident seem too bare for the voluptuous child of the sun, hence the adornment. It arises out of the same impulse as the wearing of jewelry and the making of sculpture--the urge to adorn.\n\nOn the walls of the homes of the average Negro one always finds a glut of gaudy calendars, wall pockets and advertising lithographs. The sophisticated white man or Negro would tolerate none of these, even if they bore a likeness to the Mona Lisa. No commercial art for decoration. Nor the calendar nor the advertisement spoils the picture for this lowly man. He sees the beauty in spite of the declaration of the Portland Cement Works or the butcher's announcement. I saw in Mobile a room in which there was an over-stuffed mohair living-room suite, an imitation mahogany bed and chifferobe, a console victrola. The walls were gaily papered with Sunday supplements of the Mobile Register. There were seven calendars and three wall pockets. One of them was decorated with a lace doily. The mantel-shelf was covered with a scarf of deep home-made lace, looped up with a huge bow of pink crepe paper. Over the door was a huge lithograph showing the Treaty of Versailles being signed with a Waterman fountain pen.\n\nIt was grotesque, yes. But it indicated the desire for beauty. And decorating a decoration, as in the case of the doily on the gaudy wall pocket, did not seem out of place to the hostess. The feeling back of such an act is that there can never be enough of beauty, let alone too much. Perhaps she is right. We each have our standards of art, and thus are we all interested parties and so unfit to pass judgment upon the art concepts of others.\n\nWhatever the Negro does of his own volition he embellishes. His religious service is for the greater part excellent prose poetry. Both prayers and sermons are tooled and polished until they are true works of art. The supplication is forgotten in the frenzy of creation. The prayer of the white man is considered humorous in its bleakness. The beauty of the Old Testament does not exceed that of a Negro prayer.\n\n[Angularity]\n\nAfter adornment the next most striking manifestation of the Negro is Angularity. Everything that he touches becomes angular. In all African sculpture and doctrine of any sort we find the same thing.\n\nAnyone watching Negro dancers will be struck by the same phenomenon. Every posture is another angle. Pleasing, yes. But an effect achieved by the very means which an European strives to avoid.\n\nThe pictures on the walls are hung at deep angles. Furniture is always set at an angle. I have instances of a piece of furniture in the middle of a wall being set with one end nearer the wall than the other to avoid the simple straight line.\n\n[Assymetry]\n\nAsymmetry is a definite feature of Negro art. I have no samples of true Negro painting unless we count the African shields, but the sculpture and carvings are full of this beauty and lack of symmetry.\n\nIt is present in the literature, both prose and verse. I offer an example of this quality in verse from Langston Hughes:\n\n\"I ain't gonna mistreat ma good gal any more,\nI'm just gonna kill her next time she makes me sore.\n\nI treats her kind but she don't do me right,\nShe fights and quarrels most ever' night.\n\nI can't have no woman's got such low-down ways\nCause de blue gum woman ain't de style now'days.\n\nI brought her from the South and she's goin on back,\nElse I'll use her head for a carpet tack.\"\n\nIt is the lack of symmetry which makes Negro dancing so difficult for white dancers to learn. The abrupt and unexpected changes. The frequent change of key and time are evidences of this quality in music. (Note the St. Louis Blues.)\n\nThe dancing of the justly famous Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are excellent examples.\n\nThe presence of rhythm and lack of symmetry are paradoxical, but there they are. Both are present to a marked degree. There is always rhythm, but it is the rhythm of segments. Each unit has a rhythm of its own, but when the whole is assembled it is lacking in symmetry. But easily workable to a Negro who is accustomed to the break in going from one part to another, so that he adjusts himself to the new tempo.\n\n[Dancing]\n\nNegro dancing is dynamic suggestion. No matter how violent it may appear to the beholder, every posture gives the impression that the dancer will do much more. For example, the performer flexes one knee sharply, assumes a ferocious face mask, thrusts the upper part of the body forward with clenched fists, elbows taut as in hard running or grasping a thrusting blade. That is all. But the spectator himself adds the picture of ferocious assault, hears the drums and finds himself keeping time with the music and tensing himself for the struggle. It is compelling insinuation. That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt. He is participating in the performance himself--carrying out the suggestions of the performer.\n\nThe difference in the two arts is : the white dancer attempts to express fully; the Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests. Since no art ever can express all the variations conceivable, the Negro must be considered the greater artist, his dancing is realistic suggestion, and that is about all a great artist can do.\n\n[Negro Folklore]\n\nNegro folklore is not a thing of the past. It is still in the making. Its great variety shows the adaptability of the black man: nothing is too old or too new, domestic or foreign, high or low, for his use. God and the Devil are paired, and are treated no more reverently than Rockefeller and Ford. Both of these men are prominent in folklore, Ford being particularly strong, and they talk and act like good\u00adnatured stevedores or mill-hands. Ole Massa is sometimes a smart man and often a fool. The auto\u00admobile is ranged alongside of the oxcart. The angels and the apostles walk and talk like section hands. And through it all walks Jack, the greatest culture hero of the South; Jack beats them all--even the Devil, who is often smarter than God.\n\n[Culture Heroes]\n\nThe Devil is next after Jack as a culture hero. He can out-smart everyone but Jack. God is absolutely no match for him. He is good-natured and full of humour. The sort of person one may count on to help out in any difficulty.\n\nPeter the Apostle is the third in importance. One need not look far for the explanation. The Negro is not a Christian really. The primitive gods are not deities of too subtle inner reflection ; they are hard\u00adworking bodies who serve their devotees Just as laboriously as the suppliant serves them. Gods of physical violence, stopping at nothing to serve their followers. Now of all the apostles Peter is the most active. When the other ten fell back trembling in the garden, Peter wielded the blade on the posse. Peter first and foremost in all action. The gods of no peoples have been philosophic until the people themselves have approached that state.\n\nThe rabbit, the bear, the lion, the buzzard, the fox are culture heroes from the animal world. The rabbit is far in the lead of all the others and is blood brother to Jack. In short, the trickster-hero of West Africa has been transplanted to America.\n\nJohn Henry is a culture hero in song, but no more so than Stacker Lee, Smokey Joe or Bad Lazarus. There are many, many Negroes who have never heard of any of the song heroes, but none who do not know John (Jack) and the rabbit.\n\nExamples of Folklore and the Modern Culture Hero\n\nWhy de Porpoise's Tail is on Crosswise\n\nNow, I want to tell you 'bout de porpoise. God had done made de world and everything. He set de moon and de stars in de sky. He got de fishes of de sea, and de fowls of de air completed.\n\nHe made de sun and hung it up. Then He made a nice gold track for it to run on. Then He said, \"Now, Sun, I got everything made but Time. That's up to you. I want you to start out and go round de world on dis track just as fast as you kin make it. And de time it takes you to go and come, I'm going to call day and night.\" De Sun went zoomin' on cross de elements. Now, de porpoise was hanging round there and heard God what he tole de Sun, so he decided he'd take dat trip round de world hisself. He looked up and saw de Sun kytin' along, so he lit out too, him and dat Sun!\n\nSo de porpoise beat de Sun round de world by one hour and three minutes. So God said, \"Aw naw, this ain't gointer do! I didn't mean for no thin' to be faster than de Sun!\" So God run dat porpoise for three days before he run him down and caught him, and took his tail off and put it on crossways to slow him up. Still he's de fastest thing in de water.\n\nAnd dat's why de porpoise got his tail on crossways.\n\nRockefeller and Ford\n\nOnce John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford was woofing at each other. Rockefeller told Henry Ford he could build a solid gold road round the world. Henry Ford told him if he would he would look at it and see if he liked it, and if he did he would buy it and put one of his tin lizzies on it.\n\n[Originality]\n\nIt has been said so often that the Negro is lacking in originality that it has almost become a gospel. Outward signs seem to bear this out. But if one looks closely its falsity is immediately evident.\n\nIt is obvious that to get back to original sources is much too difficultfor any group to claim very much as a certainty. What we really mean by originality is the modification of ideas. The most ardent admirer of the great Shakespeare cannot claim first source even for him. It is his treatment of the borrowed material.\n\nSo if we look at it squarely, the Negro is a very original being. While he lives and moves in the midst of a white civilisation, everything that he touches is re-interpreted for his own use. He has modified the language, mode of food preparation, practice of medicine, and most certainly the religion of his new country, just as he adapted to suit himself the Sheik hair-cut made famous by Rudolph Valentino.\n\nEveryone is familiar with the Negro's modification of the whites' musical instruments, so that his interpretation has been adopted by the white man himself and then re-interpreted. In so many words, Paul Whiteman is giving an imitation of a Negro orchestra making use of white-invented musical instru\u00adments in a Negro way. Thus has arisen a new art in the civilised world, and thus has our so-called civilisation come. The exchange and re-exchange of ideas between groups.\n\n[Imitation]\n\nThe Negro, the world over, is famous as a mimic. But this in no way damages his standing as an original. Mimicry is an art in itself. If it is not, then all art must fall by the same blow that strikes it down. When sculpture, painting, acting, dancing, literature neither reflect nor suggest anything in nature or human experience we turn away with a dull wonder in our hearts at why the thing was done. Moreover, the contention that the Negro imitates from a feeling of inferiority is incorrect. He mimics for the love of it. The group of Negroes who slavishly imitate is small. The average Negro glories in his ways. The highly educated Negro the same. The self-despisement lies in a middle class who scorns to do or be anything Negro. \"That's just like a Nigger\" is the most terrible rebuke one can lay upon this kind. He wears drab clothing, sits through a boresome church service, pretends to have no interest in the community, holds beauty contests, and otherwise apes all the mediocrities of the white brother. The truly cultured Negro scorns him, and the Negro \"farthest down\" is too busy \"spreading his junk\" in his own way to see or care. He likes his own things best. Even the group who are not Negroes but belong to the \"sixth race,\" buy such records as \"Shake dat thing\" and \"Tight lak dat.\" They really enjoy hearing a good bible-beater preach, but wild horses could drag no such admission from them. Their ready-made expression is : \"We done got away from all that now.\" Some refuse to countenance Negro music on the grounds that it is niggerism, and for that reason should be done away with. Roland Hayes was thoroughly denounced for singing spirituals until he was accepted by white audiences. Langston Hughes is not considered a poet by this group because he writes of the man in the ditch, who is more numerous and real among us than any other.\n\nBut, this group aside, let us say that the art of mimicry is better developed in the Negro than in other racial groups. He does it as the mocking-bird does it, for the love of it, and not because he wishes to be like the one imitated. I saw a group of small Negro boys imitating a cat defecating and the subsequent toilet of the cat. It was very realistic, and they enjoyed it as much as if they had been imitating a coronation ceremony. The dances are full of imitations of various animals. The buzzard lope, walking the dog, the pig's hind legs, holding the mule, elephant squat, pigeon's wing, falling off the log, seabord (imitation of an engine starting), and the like.\n\n[Absence of the Concept of Privacy]\n\nIt is said that Negroes keep nothing secret, that they have no reserve. This ought not to seem strange when one considers that we are an outdoor people accustomed to communal life. Add this to all\u00adpermeating drama and you have the explanation.\n\nThere is no privacy in an African village. Loves, fights, possessions are, to misquote Woodrow Wilson, \"Open disagreements openly arrived at.\" The community is given the benefit of a good fight as well as a good wedding. An audience is a necessary part of any drama. We merely go with nature rather than against it.\n\nDiscord is more natural than accord. If we accept the doctrine of the survival of the fittest there are more fighting honors than there are honors for other achievements. Humanity places premiums on all things necessary to its well-being, and a valiant and good fighter is valuable in any community. So why hide the light under a bushel? Moreover, intimidation is a recognised part of warfare the world over, and threats certainly must be listed under that head. So that a great threatener must certainly be con\u00adsidered an aid to the fighting machine. So then if a man or woman is a facile hurler of threats, why should he or she not show their wares to the community? Hence the holding of all quarrels and fights in the open. One relieves one's pent-up anger and at the same time earns laurels in intimidation. Besides, one does the community a service. There is nothing so exhilarating as watching well-matched oppo\u00adnents go into action. The entire world likes action, for that matter. Hence prize-fighters become millionaires.\n\nLikewise love-making is a biological necessity the world over and an art among Negroes. So that a man or woman who is proficient sees no reason why the fact should not be moot. He swaggers. She struts hippily about. Songs are built on the power to charm beneath the bed-clothes. Here again we have individuals striving to excel in what the community considers an art. Then if all of his world is seeking a great lover, why should he not speak right out loud?\n\nIt is all in a view-point. Love-making and fighting in all their branches are high arts, other things are arts among other groups where they brag about their proficiency just as brazenly as we do about these things that others consider matters for conversation behind closed doors. At any rate, the white man is despised by Negroes as a very poor fighter individually, and a very poor lover. One Negro, speaking of white men, said, \"White folks is alright when dey gits in de bank and on de law bench, but dey sho' kin lie about wimmen folks.\"\n\nI pressed him to explain. \"Well you see, white mens makes out they marries wimmen to look at they eyes, and they know they gits em for just what us gits em for. 'Nother thing, white mens say they goes clear round de world and wins all de wimmen folks way from they men folks. Dat's a lie too. They don't win nothin, they buys em. Now de way I figgers it, if a woman don't want me enough to be wid me, 'thout I got to pay her, she kin rock right on, but these here white men don't know what to do wid a woman when they gits her--dat's how come they gives they wimmen so much.

Y'all wuz put here so us mens could have some pleasure. Course I don't run round like heap uh men folks. But if my ole lady go way from me and stay more'n two weeks, I got to git me somebody, ain't I ?\"\n\n[The Jook]\n\nJook is the word for a Negro pleasure house. It may mean a bawdy house. It may mean the house set apart on public works where the men and women dance, drink and gamble. Often it is a combination of all these.\n\nIn past generations the music was furnished by \"boxes,\" another word for guitars. One guitar was enough for a dance; to have two was considered excellent. Where two were playing one man played the lead and the other seconded him. The first player was \"picking\" and the second was \"framming,\" that is, playing chords while the lead carried the melody by dexterous finger work. Sometimes a third player was added, and he played a tom-tom effect on the low strings. Believe it or not, this is excellent dance music.\n\nPianos soon came to take the place of the boxes, and now player-pianos and victrolas are in all of the Jooks.\n\nMusically speaking, the Jook is the most important place in America. For in its smelly, shoddy con\u00adfines has been born the secular music known as blues, and on blues has been founded jazz. The singing and playing in the true Negro style is called \"jooking.\"\n\nThe songs grow by incremental repetition as they travel from mouth to mouth and from Jook to Jook for years before they reach outside ears. Hence the great variety of subject-matter in each song.\n\nThe Negro dances circulated over the world were also conceived inside the Jooks. They too make the round of Jooks and public works before going into the outside world.\n\nIn this respect it is interesting to mention the Black Bottom. I have read several false accounts of its origin and name. One writer claimed that it got its name from the black sticky mud on the bottom of the Mississippi river. Other equally absurd statements gummed the press. Now the dance really originated in the Jook section of Nashville, Tennessee, around Fourth Avenue. This is a tough neighbourhood known as Black Bottom--hence the name.\n\nThe Charleston is perhaps forty years old, and was danced up and down the Atlantic seaboard from North Carolina to Key West, Florida.\n\nThe Negro social dance is slow and sensuous. The idea in the Jook is to gain sensation, and not so much exercise. So that just enough foot movement is added to keep the dancers on the floor. A tremendous sex stimulation is gained from this. But who is trying to avoid it? The man, the woman, the time and the place have met. Rather, little intimate names are indulged in to heap fire on fire.\n\nThese too have spread to all the world.\n\nThe Negro theatre, as built up by the Negro, is based on Jook situations, with women, gambling, fighting, drinking. Shows like \"Dixie to Broadway\" are only Negro in cast, and could just as well have come from pre-Soviet Russia.\n\nAnother interesting thing--Negro shows before being tampered with did not specialise in octoroon chorus girls. The girl who could hoist a Jook song from her belly and lam it against the front door of the theatre was the lead, even if she were as black as the hinges of hell. The question was \"Can she jook?\" She must also have a good belly wobble, and her hips must, to quote a popular work song, \"Shake like jelly all over and be so broad, Lawd, Lawd, and be so broad.\" So that the bleached chorus is the result of a white demand and not the Negro's.\n\nThe woman in the Jook may be nappy headed and black, but if she is a good lover she gets there just the same. A favorite Jook song of the past has this to say:\n\nSinger : It ain't good looks dat takes you through dis world.\nAudience : What is it, good mama?\nSinger: Elgin movements in your hips. Twenty years guarantee.\n\nAnd it always brought down the house too.\n\nOh de white gal rides in a Cadillac,\nDe yaller gal rides de same,\nBlack gal rides in a rusty Ford\nBut she gits dere just de same.\n\nThe sort of woman her men idealise is the type that is put forth in the theatre. The art-creating Negro prefers a not too thin woman,who can shake like jelly all over as she dances and sings, and that is the type he put forth on the stage. She has been banished by the white producer and the Negro who takes his cue from the white.\n\nOf course a black woman is never the wife of the upper class Negro in the North. This state of affairs does not obtain in the South, however. I have noted numerous cases where the wife was considerably darker than the husband. People of some substance, too.\n\nThis scornful attitude towards black women receives mouth sanction by the mud-sills.\n\nEven on the works and in the Jooks the black man sings disparagingly of black women. They say that she is evil. That she sleeps with her fists doubled up and ready for action. All over they are making a little drama of waking up a yaller wife and a black one.\n\nA man is lying beside his yaller wife and wakes her up. She says to him, \"Darling, do you know what I was dreaming when you woke me up?\" He says, \"No honey, what was you dreaming?\" She says, \"I dreamt I had done cooked you a big, fine dinner and we was setting down to eat out de same plate and I was setting on yo' lap jus huggin you and kissin you and you was so sweet.\"\n\nWake up a black woman, and before you kin git any sense into her she be done up and lammed you over the head four or five times. When you git her quiet she'll say, \"Nigger, know whut I was dreamin when you woke me up?\"\n\nYou say, \"No honey, what was you dreamin?\" She says, \"I dreamt you shook yo' rusty fist under my nose and I split yo' head open wid a axe.\"\n\nBut in spite of disparaging fictitious drama, in real life the black girl is drawing on his account at the commissary. Down in the Cypress Swamp as he swings his axe he chants:\n\n\"Dat ole black gal, she keep on grumblin,\nNew pair shoes, new pair shoes,\nI'm goint to buy her shoes and stockings\nSlippers too, slippers too.\"\n\nThen adds aside : \"Blacker de berry, sweeter de juice.\"\n\nTo be sure the black gal is still in power, men are still cutting and shooting their way to her pillow. To the queen of the Jook!\n\nSpeaking of the influence of the Jook, I noted that Mae West in \"Sex\" had much more flavor of the turpentine quarters than she did of the white bawd. I know that the piece she played on the piano is a very old Jook composition. \"Honey let yo' drawers hang low\" had been played and sung in every Jook in the South for at least thirty-five years. It has always puzzled me why she thought it likely to be played in a Canadian bawdy house.\n\nSpeaking of the use of Negro material by white performers, it is astonishing that so many are trying it, and I have never seen one yet entirely realistic. They often have all the elements of the song, dance, or expression, but they are misplaced or distorted by the accent falling on the wrong element. Every one seems to think that the Negro is easily imitated when nothing is further from the truth. Without exception I wonder why the black-face comedians are black-face; it is a puzzle--good comedians, but darn poor niggers. Gershwin and the other \"Negro\" rhapsodists come under this same axe. Just about as Negro as caviar or Ann Pennington's athletic Black Bottom. When the Negroes who knew the Black Bottom in its cradle saw the Broadway version they asked each other, \"Is you learnt dat new Black Bottom yet?\" Proof that it was not their dance.\n\nAnd God only knows what the world has suffered from the white damsels who try to sing Blues.\n\nThe Negroes themselves have sinned also in this respect. In spite of the goings up and down on the earth, from the original Fisk Jubilee Singers down to the present, there has been no genuine presentation of Negro songs to white audiences. The spirituals that have been sung around the world are Negroid to be sure, but so full of musicians' tricks that Negro congregations are highly entertained when they hear their old songs so changed. They never use the new style songs, and these are never heard unless perchance some daughter or son has been off to college and returns with one of the old songs with its face lifted, so to speak.\n\nI am of the opinion that this trick style of delivery was originated by the Fisk Singers; Tuskeegee and Hampton followed suit and have helped spread this misconception of Negro spirituals. This Glee Club style has gone on so long and become so fixed among concert singers that it is considered quite authentic. But I say again, that not one concert singer in the world is singing the songs as the Negro song-makers sing them.\n\nIf anyone wishes to prove the truth of this let him step into some unfashionable Negro church and hear for himself.\n\nTo those who want to institute the Negro theatre, let me say it is already established. It is lacking in wealth, so it is not seen in the high places. A creature with a white head and Negro feet struts the Metropolitan boards. The real Negro theatre is in the Jooks and the cabarets. Self-conscious individuals may turn away the eye and say, \"Let us search elsewhere for our dramatic art.\" Let 'em search. They certainly won't find it. Butter Beans and Susie, Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are the only performers of the real Negro school it has ever been my pleasure to behold in New York.\n\n[Dialect]\n\nIf we are to believe the majority of writers of Negro dialect and the burnt-cork artists, Negro speech is a weird thing, full of \"ams\" and \"Ises.\" Fortunately we don't have to believe them. We may go directly to the Negro and let him speak for himself.\n\nI know that I run the risk of being damned as an infidel for declaring that nowhere can be found the Negro who asks \"am it?\" nor yet his brother who announces \"Ise uh gwinter.\" He exists only for a certain type of writers and performers.\n\nVery few Negroes, educated or not, use a clear clipped \"I.\" It verges more or less upon \"Ah.\" I think the lip form is responsible for this to a great extent. By experiment the reader will find that a sharp \"i\" is very much easier with a thin taut lip than with a full soft lip. Like tightening violin strings.\n\nIf one listens closely one will note too that a word is slurred in one position in the sentence but clearly pronounced in another. This is particularly true of the pronouns. A pronoun as a subject is likely to be clearly enunciated, but slurred as an object. For example: \"You better not let me ketch yuh.\"\n\nThere is a tendency in some localities to add the \"h\" to \"it\" and pronounce it \"hit.\" Probably a vestige of old English. In some localities \"if \" is \"ef.\"\n\nIn story telling \"so\" is universally the connective. It is used even as an introductory word, at the very beginning of a story. In religious expression \"and\" is used. The trend in stories is to state conclusions; in religion, to enumerate.\n\nI am mentioning only the most general rules in dialect because there are so many quirks that belong only to certain localities that nothing less than a volume would be adequate.\n\nNow He told me, He said, \"You got the three witnesses. One is water, one is spirit, and one is blood. And these three correspond with the three in heben--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\"\n\nNow I ast Him about this lyin in sin and He give me a handful of seed and He tole me to sow 'em in a bed and He tole me: \"I want you to watch them seeds.\" The seeds come up about in places and He said: \"Those seeds that come up, they died in the heart of the earth and quickened and come up and brought forth fruit. But those seeds that didn't come up, they died in the heart of the earth and rottenend.\n\n\"And a soul that dies and quickens through my spirit they will live forever, but those that dont never pray, they are lost forever.

The first sounds from the street had told me, according to whether they came to my ears dulled and distorted by the moisture of the atmosphere or quivering like arrows in the resonant and empty area of a spacious, crisply frozen, pure morning; as soon as I heard the rumble of the first tramcar, I could tell whether it was sodden with rain or setting forth into the blue. And perhaps these sounds had themselves been forestalled by some swifter and more pervasive emanation which, stealing into my slumber, diffused in it a melancholy that seemed to presage snow, or gave utterance (through the lips of a little person who occasionally reappeared there) to so many hymns to the glory of the sun that, having first of all begun to smile in my sleep, having prepared my eyes, behind their shut lids, to be dazzled, I awoke finally amid deafening strains of music. It was, moreover, principally from my bedroom that I took in the life of the outer world during this period. I know that Bloch reported that, when he called to see me in the evenings, he could hear the sound of conversation; as my mother was at Combray and he never found anybody in my room, he concluded that I was talking to myself. When, much later, he learned that Albertine had been staying with me at the time, and realised that I had concealed her presence from all my friends, he declared that he saw at last the reason why, during that episode in my life, I had always refused to go out of doors. He was wrong. His mistake was, however, quite pardonable, for the truth, even if it is inevitable, is not always conceivable as a whole. People who learn some accurate detail of another person\u2019s life at once deduce consequences which are not accurate, and see in the newly discovered fact an explanation of things that have no connexion with it whatsoever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I reflect now that my mistress had come, on our return from Balbec, to live in Paris under the same roof as myself, that she had abandoned the idea of going on a cruise, that she was installed in a bedroom within twenty paces of my own, at the end of the corridor, in my father\u2019s tapestried study, and that late every night, before leaving me, she used to slide her tongue between my lips like a portion of daily bread, a nourishing food that had the almost sacred character of all flesh upon which the sufferings that we have endured on its account have come in time to confer a sort of spiritual grace, what I at once call to mind in comparison is not the night that Captain de Borodino allowed me to spend in barracks, a favour which cured what was after all only a passing distemper, but the night on which my father sent Mamma to sleep in the little bed by the side of my own. So it is that life, if it is once again to deliver us from an anguish that has seemed inevitable, does so in conditions that are different, so diametrically opposed at times that it is almost an open sacrilege to assert the identity of the grace bestowed upon us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine had heard from Fran\u00e7oise that, in the darkness of my still curtained room, I was not asleep, she had no scruple about making a noise as she took her bath, in her own dressing-room. Then, frequently, instead of waiting until later in the day, I would repair to a bathroom adjoining hers, which had a certain charm of its own. Time was, when a stage manager would spend hundreds of thousands of francs to begem with real emeralds the throne upon which a great actress would play the part of an empress. The Russian ballet has taught us that simple arrangements of light will create, if trained upon the right spot, jewels as gorgeous and more varied. This decoration, itself immaterial, is not so graceful, however, as that which, at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, the sun substitutes for what we were accustomed to see when we did not arise before noon. The windows of our respective bathrooms, so that their occupants might not be visible from without, were not of clear glass but clouded with an artificial and old \u2014 fashioned kind of frost. All of a sudden, the sun would colour this drapery of glass, gild it, and discovering in myself an earlier young man whom habit had long concealed, would intoxicate me with memories, as though I were out in the open country gazing at a hedge of golden leaves in which even a bird was not lacking. For I could hear Albertine ceaselessly humming:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For melancholy Is but folly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he who heeds it is a fool\n\nI loved her so well that I could spare a joyous smile for her bad taste in music. This song had, as it happened, during the past summer, delighted Mme. Bontemps, who presently heard people say that it was silly, with the result that, instead of asking Albertine to sing it, when she had a party, she would substitute:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A song of farewell rises from troubled springs\n\nWhich in its turn became \u2018an old jingle of Massenet\u2019s, the child is always dinning into our ears.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cloud passed, blotting out the sun; I saw extinguished and replaced by a grey monochrome the modest, screening foliage of the glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The partition that divided our two dressing-rooms (Albertine\u2019s, identical with my own, was a bathroom which Mamma, who had another at the other end of the flat, had never used for fear of disturbing my rest) was so slender that we could talk to each other as we washed in double privacy, carrying on a conversation that was interrupted only by the sound of the water, in that intimacy which, in hotels, is so. often permitted by the smallness and proximity of the rooms, but which, in private houses in Paris, is so rare\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On other mornings, I would remain in bed, drowsing for as long as I chose, for orders had been given that no one was to enter my room until I had rung the bell, an act which, owing to the awkward position in which the electric bulb had been hung above my bed, took such a time that often, tired of feeling for it and glad to be left alone, I would lie back for some moments and almost fall asleep again. It was not that I was wholly indifferent to Albertine\u2019s presence in the house. Her separation from her girl friends had the effect of sparing my heart any fresh anguish. She kept it in a state of repose, in a semi-immobility which would help it to recover. But after all, this calm which my mistress was procuring for me was a release from suffering rather than a positive joy. Not that it did not permit me to taste many joys, from which too keen a grief had debarred me, but these joys, so far from my owing them to Albertine, in whom for that matter I could no longer see any beauty and who was beginning to bore me, with whom I was now clearly conscious that I was not in love, I tasted on the contrary when Albertine was not with me. And so, to begin the morning, I did not send for her at once, especially if it was a fine day. For some moments, knowing that he would make me happier than Albertine, I remained closeted with the little person inside me, hymning the rising sun, of whom I have already spoken. Of those elements which compose our personality, it is not the most obvious that are most essential. In myself, when ill health has succeeded in uprooting them one after another, there will still remain two or three, endowed with a hardier constitution than the rest, notably a certain philosopher who is happy only when he has discovered in two works of art, in two sensations, a common element. But the last of all, I have sometimes asked myself whether it would not be this little mannikin, very similar to another whom the optician at Combray used to set up in his shop window to forecast the weather, and who, doffing his hood when the sun shone, would put it on again if it was going to rain. This little mannikin, I know his egoism; I may be suffering from a choking fit which the mere threat of rain would calm; he pays no heed, and, at the first drops so impatiently awaited, losing his gaiety, sullenly pulls down his hood. Conversely, I dare say that in my last agony, when all my other \u2018selves\u2019 are dead, if a ray of sunshine steals into the room, while I am drawing my last breath, the little fellow of the barometer will feel a great relief, and will throw back his hood to sing: \u201cAh! Fine weather at last!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rang for Fran\u00e7oise. I opened the Figaro. I scanned its columns and made sure that it did not contain an article, or so-called article, which I had sent to the editor, and which was no more than a slightly revised version of the page that had recently come to light, written long ago in Dr. Percepied\u2019s carriage, as I gazed at the spires of Martinville. Then I read Mamma\u2019s letter. She felt it to be odd, in fact shocking, that a girl should be staying in the house alone with me. On the first day, at the moment of leaving Balbec, when she saw how wretched I was, and was distressed by the prospect of leaving me by myself, my mother had perhaps been glad when she heard that Albertine was travelling with us, and saw that, side by side with our own boxes (those boxes among which I had passed a night in tears in the Balbec hotel), there had been hoisted into the \u2018Twister\u2019 Albertine\u2019s boxes also, narrow and black, which had seemed to me to have the appearance of coffins, and as to which I knew not whether they were bringing to my house life or death. But I had never even asked myself the question, being all overjoyed, in the radiant morning, after the fear of having to remain at Balbec, that I was taking Albertine with me. But to this proposal, if at the start my mother had not been hostile (speaking kindly to my friend like a mother whose son has been seriously wounded and who is grateful to the young mistress who is nursing him with loving care), she had acquired hostility now that it had been too completely realised, and the girl was prolonging her sojourn in our house, and moreover in the absence of my parents. I cannot, however, say that my mother ever made this hostility apparent. As in the past, when she had ceased to dare to reproach me with my nervous instability, my laziness, now she felt a hesitation \u2014 which I perhaps did not altogether perceive at the moment or refused to perceive \u2014 to run the risk, by offering any criticism of the girl to whom I had told her that I intended to make an offer of marriage, of bringing a shadow into my life, making me in time to come less devoted to my wife, of sowing perhaps for a season when she herself would no longer be there, the seeds of remorse at having grieved her by marrying Albertine. Mamma preferred to seem to be approving a choice which she felt herself powerless to make me reconsider. But people who came in contact with her at this time have since told me that in addition to her grief at having lost her mother she had an air of constant preoccupation. This mental strife, this inward debate, had the effect of overheating my mother\u2019s brow, and she was always opening the windows to let in the fresh air. But she did not succeed in coming to any decision, for fear of influencing me in the wrong direction and so spoiling what she believed to be my happiness. She could not even bring herself to forbid me to keep Albertine for the time being in our house. She did not wish to appear more strict than Mme. Bontemps, who was the person principally concerned, and who saw no harm in the arrangement, which greatly surprised my mother. All the same, she regretted that she had been obliged to leave us together, by departing at that very time for Combray where she might have to remain (and did in fact remain) for months on end, during which my great-aunt required her incessant attention by day and night. Everything was made easy for her down there, thanks to the kindness, the devotion of Legrandin who, gladly undertaking any trouble that was required, kept putting off his return to Paris from week to week, not that he knew my aunt at all well, but simply, first of all, because she had been his mother\u2019s friend, and also because he knew that the invalid, condemned to die, valued his attentions and could not get on without him. Snobbishness is a serious malady of the spirit, but one that is localised and does not taint it as a whole. I, on the other hand, unlike Mamma, was extremely glad of her absence at Combray, but for which I should have been afraid (being unable to warn Albertine not to mention it) of her learning of the girl\u2019s friendship with Mlle. Vinteuil. This would have been to my mother an insurmountable obstacle, not merely to a marriage as to which she had, for that matter, begged me to say nothing definite as yet to Albertine, and the thought of which was becoming more and more intolerable to myself, but even to the latter\u2019s being allowed to stay for any length of time in the house. Apart from so grave a reason, which in this case did not apply, Mamma, under the dual influence of my grandmother\u2019s liberating and edifying example, according to whom, in her admiration of George Sand, virtue consisted in nobility of heart, and of my own corruption, was now indulgent towards women whose conduct she would have condemned in the past, or even now, had they been any of her own middle-class friends in Paris or at Combray, but whose lofty natures I extolled to her and to whom she pardoned much because of their affection for myself. But when all is said, and apart from any question of propriety, I doubt whether Albertine could have put up with Mamma who had acquired from Combray, from my aunt L\u00e9onie, from all her kindred, habits of punctuality and order of which my mistress had not the remotest conception\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She would never think of shutting a door and, on the other hand, would no more hesitate to enter a room if the door stood open than would a dog or a cat. Her somewhat disturbing charm was, in fact, that of taking the place in the household not so much of a girl as of a domestic animal which comes into a room, goes out, is to be found wherever one does not expect to find it and (in her case) would \u2014 bringing me a profound sense of repose \u2014 come and lie down on my bed by my side, make a place for herself from which she never stirred, without being in my way as a person would have been. She ended, however, by conforming to my hours of sleep, and not only never attempted to enter my room but would take care not to make a sound until I had rung my bell. It was Fran\u00e7oise who impressed these rules of conduct upon her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was one of those Combray servants, conscious of their master\u2019s place in the world, and that the least that they can do is to see that he is treated with all the respect to which they consider him entitled. When a stranger on leaving after a visit gave Fran\u00e7oise a gratuity to be shared with the kitchenmaid, he had barely slipped his coin into her hand before Fran\u00e7oise, with an equal display of speed, discretion and energy, had passed the word to the kitchenmaid who came forward to thank him, not in a whisper, but openly and aloud, as Fran\u00e7oise had told her that she must do. The parish priest of Combray was no genius, but he also knew what was due him. Under his instruction, the daughter of some Protestant cousins of Mme. Sazerat had been received into the Church, and her family had been most grateful to him: it was a question of her marriage to a young nobleman of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. The young man\u2019s relatives wrote to inquire about her in a somewhat arrogant letter, in which they expressed their dislike of her Protestant origin. The Combray priest replied in such a tone that the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise nobleman, crushed and prostrate, wrote a very different letter in which he begged as the most precious favour the award of the girl\u2019s hand in marriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise deserved no special credit for making Albertine respect my slumbers. She was imbued with tradition. From her studied silence, or the peremptory response that she made to a proposal to enter my room, or to send in some message to me, which Albertine had expressed in all innocence, the latter realised with astonishment that she was now living in an alien world, where strange customs prevailed, governed by rules of conduct which one must never dream of infringing. She had already had a foreboding of this at Balbec, but, in Paris, made no attempt to resist, and would wait patiently every morning for the sound of my bell before venturing to make any noise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The training that Fran\u00e7oise gave her was of value also to our old servant herself, for it gradually stilled the lamentations which, ever since our return from Balbec, she had not ceased to utter. For, just as we were boarding the tram, she remembered that she had forgotten to say good-bye to the housekeeper of the Hotel, a whiskered dame who looked after the bedroom floors, barely knew Fran\u00e7oise by sight, but had been comparatively civil to her. Fran\u00e7oise positively insisted upon getting out of the tram, going back to the Hotel, saying good-bye properly to the housekeeper, and not leaving for Paris until the following day. Common sense, coupled with my sudden horror of Balbec, restrained me from granting her this concession, but my refusal had infected her with a feverish distemper which the change of air had not sufficed to cure and which lingered on in Paris. For, according to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s code, as it is illustrated in the carvings of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, to wish for the death of an enemy, even to inflict it is not forbidden, but it is a horrible sin not to do what is expected of you, not to return a civility, to refrain, like a regular churl, from saying good-bye to the housekeeper before leaving a hotel. Throughout the journey, the continually recurring memory of her not having taken leave of this woman had dyed Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s cheeks with a scarlet flush that was quite alarming. And if she refused to taste bite or sup until we reached Paris, it was perhaps because this memory heaped a \u2018regular load\u2019 upon her stomach (every class of society has a pathology of its own) even more than with the intention of punishing us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the reasons which led Mamma to write me a daily letter, and a letter which never failed to include some quotation from Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, there was the memory of my grandmother. Mamma would write to me: \u201cMme. Sazerat gave us one of those little luncheons of which she possesses the secret and which, as your poor grandmother would have said, quoting Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, deprive us of solitude without affording us company.\u201d In one of my own earlier letters I was so inept as to write to Mamma: \u201cBy those quotations, your mother would recognise you at once.\u201d Which brought me, three days later, the reproof: \u201cMy poor boy, if it was only to speak to me of my mother, your reference to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 was most inappropriate. She would have answered you as she answered Mme. de Grignan: \u2018So she was nothing to you? I had supposed that you were related.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, I could hear my mistress leaving or returning to her room. I rang the bell, for it was time now for Andr\u00e9e to arrive with the chauffeur, Morel\u2019s friend, lent me by the Verdurins, to take Albertine out. I had spoken to the last-named of the remote possibility of our marriage; but I had never made her any formal promise; she herself, from discretion, when I said to her: \u201cI can\u2019t tell, but it might perhaps be possible,\u201d had shaken her head with a melancholy sigh, as much as to say: \u201cOh, no, never,\u201d in other words: \u201cI am too poor.\u201d And so, while I continued to say: \u201cIt is quite indefinite,\u201d when speaking of future projects, at the moment I was doing everything in my power to amuse her, to make life pleasant to her, with perhaps the unconscious design of thereby making her wish to marry me. She herself laughed at my lavish generosity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e\u2019s mother would be in a fine state if she saw me turn into a rich lady like herself, what she calls a lady who has her own \u2018horses, carriages, pictures.\u2019 What? Did I never tell you that she says that. Oh, she\u2019s a character! What surprises me is that she seems to think pictures just as important as horses and carriages.\u201d We shall see in due course that, notwithstanding the foolish ways of speaking that she had not outgrown, Albertine had developed to an astonishing extent, which left me unmoved, the intellectual superiority of a woman friend having always interested me so little that if I have ever complimented any of my friends upon her own, it was purely out of politeness. Alone, the curious genius of C\u00e9leste might perhaps appeal to me. In spite of myself, I would continue to smile for some moments, when, for instance, having discovered that Fran\u00e7oise was not in my room, she accosted me with: \u201cHeavenly deity reclining on a bed!\u201d \u201cBut why, C\u00e9leste,\u201d I would say, \u201cwhy deity?\u201d \u201cOh, if you suppose that you have anything in common with the mortals who make their pilgrimage on our vile earth, you are greatly mistaken!\u201d \u201cBut why \u2018reclining\u2019 on a bed, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m lying in bed?\u201d \u201cYou never lie. Who ever saw anybody lie like that? You have just alighted there. With your white pyjamas, and the way you twist your neck, you look for all the world like a dove.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, even in the discussion of the most trivial matters, expressed herself very differently from the little girl that she had been only a few years earlier at Balbec. She went so far as to declare, with regard to a political incident of which she disapproved: \u201cI consider that ominous.\u201d And I am not sure that it was not about this time that she learned to say, when she meant that she felt a book to be written in a bad style: \u201cIt is interesting, but really, it might have been written by a pig.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rule that she must not enter my room until I had rung amused her greatly. As she had adopted our family habit of quotation, and in following it drew upon the plays in which she had acted at her convent and for which I had expressed admiration, she always compared me to Assu\u00e9rus:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And death is the reward of whoso dares\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To venture in his presence unawares\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None is exempt; nor is there any whom\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or rank or sex can save from such a doom;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even I myself\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like all the rest, I by this law am bound;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, to address him, I must first be found\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By him, or he must call me to his side\n\nPhysically, too, she had altered. Her blue, almond-shaped eyes, grown longer, had not kept their form; they were indeed of the same colour, but seemed to have passed into a liquid state. So much so that, when she shut them it was as though a pair of curtains had been drawn to shut out a view of the sea. It was no doubt this one of her features that I remembered most vividly each night after we had parted. For, on the contrary, every morning the ripple of her hair continued to give me the same surprise, as though it were some novelty that I had never seen before. And yet, above the smiling eyes of a girl, what could be more beautiful than that clustering coronet of black violets? The smile offers greater friendship; but the little gleaming tips of blossoming hair, more akin to the flesh, of which they seem to be a transposition into tiny waves, are more provocative of desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she entered my room, she sprang upon my bed and sometimes would expatiate upon my type of intellect, would vow in a transport of sincerity that she would sooner die than leave me: this was on mornings when I had shaved before sending for her. She was one of those women who can never distinguish the cause of their sensations. The pleasure that they derive from a smooth cheek they explain to themselves by the moral qualities of the man who seems to offer them a possibility of future happiness, which is capable, however, of diminishing and becoming less necessary the longer he refrains from shaving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I inquired where she was thinking of going\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI believe Andr\u00e9e wants to take me to the Buttes-Chaumont; I have never been there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course it was impossible for me to discern among so many other words whether beneath these a falsehood lay concealed. Besides, I could trust Andr\u00e9e to tell me of all the places that she visited with Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, when I felt that I was utterly tired of Albertine, I had made up my mind to say, untruthfully, to Andr\u00e9e: \u201cMy little Andr\u00e9e, if only I had met you again sooner! It is you that I would have loved. But now my heart is pledged in another quarter. All the same, we can see a great deal of each other, for my love for another is causing me great anxiety, and you will help me to find consolation.\u201d And lo, these identical lying words had become true within the space of three weeks. Perhaps, Andr\u00e9e had believed in Paris that it was indeed a lie and that I was in love with her, as she would doubtless have believed at Balbec. For the truth is so variable for each of us, that other people have difficulty in recognising themselves in it. And as I knew that she would tell me everything that she and Albertine had done, I had asked her, and she had agreed to come and call for Albertine almost every day. In this way I might without anxiety remain at home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, Andr\u00e9e\u2019s privileged position as one of the girls of the little band gave me confidence that she would obtain everything that I might require from Albertine. Truly, I could have said to her now in all sincerity that she would be capable of setting my mind at rest\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my choice of Andr\u00e9e (who happened to be staying in Paris, having given up her plan of returning to Balbec) as guide and companion to my mistress was prompted by what Albertine had told me of the affection that her friend had felt for me at Balbec, at a time when, on the contrary, I had supposed that I was boring her; indeed, if I had known this at the time, it is perhaps with Andr\u00e9e that I would have fallen in love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat, you never knew,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cbut we were always joking about it. Do you mean to say you never noticed how she used to copy all your ways of talking and arguing? When she had just been with you, it was too obvious. She had no need to tell us whether she had seen you. As soon as she joined us, we could tell at once. We used to look at one another, and laugh. She was like a coalheaver who tries to pretend that he isn\u2019t one. He is black all over. A miller has no need to say that he is a miller, you can see the flour all over his clothes; and the mark of the sacks he has carried on his shoulder. Andr\u00e9e was just the same, she would knit her eyebrows the way you do, and stretch out her long neck, and I don\u2019t know what all. When I take up a book that has been in your room, even if I\u2019m reading it out of doors, I can tell at once that it belongs to you because it still reeks of your beastly fumigations. It\u2019s only a trifle, still it\u2019s rather a nice trifle, don\u2019t you know. Whenever anybody spoke nicely about you, seemed to think a lot of you, Andr\u00e9e was in ecstasies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding all this, in case there might have been some secret plan made behind my back, I advised her to give up the Buttes-Chaumont for that day and to go instead to Saint-Cloud or somewhere else\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was certainly not, as I was well aware, because I was the least bit in love with Albertine. Love is nothing more perhaps than the stimulation of those eddies which, in the wake of an emotion, stir the soul. Certain such eddies had indeed stirred my soul through and through when Albertine spoke to me at Balbec about Mlle. Vinteuil, but these were now stilled. I was no longer in love with Albertine, for I no longer felt anything of the suffering, now healed, which I had felt in the tram at Balbec, upon learning how Albertine had spent her girlhood, with visits perhaps to Montjouvain. All this, I had too long taken for granted, was healed. But, now and again, certain expressions used by Albertine made me suppose \u2014 why, I cannot say \u2014 that she must in the course of her life, short as it had been, have received declarations of affection, and have received them with pleasure, that is to say with sensuality. Thus, she would say, in any connexion: \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d Certainly, if she had said, like an Odette: \u201cIs it really true, that thumping lie?\u201d I should not have been disturbed, for the absurdity of the formula would have explained itself as a stupid inanity of feminine wit. But her questioning air: \u201cIs that true?\u201d gave on the one hand the strange impression of a creature incapable of judging things by herself, who appeals to you for your testimony, as though she were not endowed with the same faculties as yourself (if you said to her: \u201cWhy, we\u2019ve been out for a whole hour,\u201d or \u201cIt is raining,\u201d she would ask: \u201cIs that true?\u201d). Unfortunately, on the other hand, this want of facility in judging external phenomena for herself could not be the real origin of her \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d It seemed rather that these words had been, from the dawn of her precocious adolescence, replies to: \u201cYou know, I never saw anybody as pretty as you.\u201d \u201cYou know I am madly in love with you, I am most terribly excited.\u201d\u2014 affirmations that were answered, with a coquettishly consenting modesty, by these repetitions of: \u201cIs that true? Is it really true?\u201d which no longer served Albertine, when in my company, save to reply by a question to some such affirmation as: \u201cYou have been asleep for more than an hour.\u201d \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without feeling that I was the least bit in the world in love with Albertine, without including in the list of my pleasures the moments that we spent together, I was still preoccupied with the way in which she disposed of her time; had I not, indeed, fled from Balbec in order to make certain that she could no longer meet this or that person with whom I was so afraid of her misbehaving, simply as a joke (a joke at my expense, perhaps), that I had adroitly planned to sever, at one and the same time, by my departure, all her dangerous entanglements? And Albertine was so entirely passive, had so complete a faculty of forgetting things and submitting to pressure, that these relations had indeed been severed and I myself relieved of my haunting dread. But that dread is capable of assuming as many forms as the undefined evil that is its cause. So long as my jealousy was not reincarnate in fresh people, I had enjoyed after the passing of my anguish an interval of calm. But with a chronic malady, the slightest pretext serves to revive it, as also with the vice of the person who is the cause of our jealousy the slightest opportunity may serve her to practise it anew (after a lull of chastity) with different people. I had managed to separate Albertine from her accomplices, and, by so doing, to exorcise my hallucinations; even if it was possible to make her forget people, to cut short her attachments, her sensual inclination was, itself also, chronic and was perhaps only waiting for an opportunity to afford itself an outlet. Now Paris provided just as many opportunities as Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any town whatsoever, she had no need to seek, for the evil existed not in Albertine alone, but in others to whom any opportunity for enjoyment is good. A glance from one, understood at once by the other, brings the two famished souls in contact. And it is easy for a clever woman to appear not to have seen, then five minutes later to join the person who has read her glance and is waiting for her in a side street, and, in a few words, to make an appointment. Who will ever know? And it was so simple for Albertine to tell me, in order that she might continue these practices, that she was anxious to see again some place on the outskirts of Paris that she had liked. And so it was enough that she should return later than usual, that her expedition should have taken an unaccountable time, although it was perfectly easy perhaps to account for it without introducing any sensual reason, for my malady to break out afresh, attached this time to mental pictures which were not of Balbec, and which I would set to work, as with their predecessors, to destroy, as though the destruction of an ephemeral cause could put an end to a congenital malady. I did not take into account the fact that in these acts of destruction, in which I had as an accomplice, in Albertine, her faculty of changing, her ability to forget, almost to hate the recent object of her love, I was sometimes causing a profound grief to one or other of those persons unknown with whom in turn she had taken her pleasure, and that this grief I was causing them in vain, for they would be abandoned, replaced, and, parallel to the path strewn with all the derelicts of her light-hearted infidelities, there would open for me another, pitiless path broken only by an occasional brief respite; so that my suffering could end only with Albertine\u2019s life or with my own. Even in the first days after our return to Paris, not satisfied by the information that Andr\u00e9e and the chauffeur had given me as to their expeditions with my mistress, I had felt the neighbourhood of Paris to be as tormenting as that of Balbec, and had gone off for a few days in the country with Albertine. But everywhere my uncertainty as to what she might be doing was the same; the possibility that it was something wrong as abundant, vigilance even more difficult, with the result that I returned with her to Paris. In leaving Balbec, I had imagined that I was leaving Gomorrah, plucking Albertine from it; in reality, alas, Gomorrah was dispersed to all the ends of the earth. And partly out of jealousy, partly out of ignorance of such joys (a case which is rare indeed), I had arranged unawares this game of hide and seek in which Albertine was always to escape me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I questioned her point-blank: \u201cOh, by the way, Albertine, am I dreaming, or did you tell me that you knew Gilberte Swann?\u201d \u201cYes; that is to say, she used to talk to me at our classes, because she had a set of the French history notes, in fact she was very nice about it, and let me borrow them, and I gave them back the next time I saw her.\u201d \u201cIs she the kind of woman that I object to?\u201d \u201cOh, not at all, quite the opposite.\u201d But, rather than indulge in this sort of criminal investigation, I would often devote to imagining Albertine\u2019s excursion the energy that I did not employ in sharing it, and would speak to my mistress with that ardour which remains intact in our unfulfilled designs. I expressed so keen a longing to see once again some window in the Sainte-Chapelle, so keen a regret that I was not able to go there with her alone, that she said to me lovingly: \u201cWhy, my dear boy, since you seem so keen about it, make a little effort, come with us. We can start as late as you like, whenever you\u2019re ready. And if you\u2019d rather be alone with me, I have only to send Andr\u00e9e home, she can come another time.\u201d But these very entreaties to me to go out added to the calm which allowed me to yield to my desire to remain indoors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It did not occur to me that the apathy that was indicated by my delegating thus to Andr\u00e9e or the chauffeur the task of soothing my agitation by leaving them to keep watch over Albertine, was paralysing in me, rendering inert all those imaginative impulses of the mind, all those inspirations of the will, which enable us to guess, to forestall, what some one else is about to do; indeed the world of possibilities has always been more open to me than that of real events. This helps us to understand the human heart, but we are apt to be taken in by individuals. My jealousy was born of mental images, a form of self torment not based upon probability. Now there may occur in the lives of men and of nations (and there was to occur, one day, in my own life) a moment when we need to have within us a superintendent of police, a clear-sighted diplomat, a master-detective, who instead of pondering over the concealed possibilities that extend to all the points of the compass, reasons accurately, says to himself: \u201cIf Germany announces this, it means that she intends to do something else, not just \u2018something\u2019 in the abstract but precisely this or that or the other, which she may perhaps have begun already to do.\u201d \u201cIf So-and-So has fled, it is not in the direction a or b or d, but to the point c, and the place to which we must direct our search for him is c.\u201d Alas, this faculty which was not highly developed in me, I allowed to grow slack, to lose its power, to vanish, by acquiring the habit of growing calm the moment that other people were engaged in keeping watch on my behalf\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the reason for my reluctance to leave the house, I should not have liked to explain it to Albertine. I told her that the doctor had ordered me to stay in bed. This was not true. And if it had been true, his prescription would have been powerless to prevent me from accompanying my mistress. I asked her to excuse me from going out with herself and Andr\u00e9e. I shall mention only one of my reasons, which was dictated by prudence. Whenever I went out with Albertine, if she left my side for a moment, I became anxious, began to imagine that she had spoken to, or simply cast a glance at somebody. If she was not in the best of tempers, I thought that I was causing her to miss or to postpone some appointment. Reality is never more than an allurement to an unknown element in quest of which we can never progress very far. It is better not to know, to think as little as possible, not to feed our jealousy with the slightest concrete detail. Unfortunately, even when we eliminate the outward life, incidents are created by the inward life also; though I held aloof from Albertine\u2019s expeditions, the random course of my solitary reflexions furnished me at times with those tiny fragments of the truth which attract to themselves, like a magnet, an inkling of the unknown, which, from that moment, becomes painful. Even if we live in a hermetically sealed compartment, associations of ideas, memories continue to act upon us. But these internal shocks did not occur immediately; no sooner had Albertine started on her drive than I was revivified, were it only for a few moments, by the stimulating virtues of solitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my share of the pleasures of the new day; the arbitrary desire \u2014 the capricious and purely spontaneous inclination to taste them would not have sufficed to place them within my reach, had not the peculiar state of the weather not merely reminded me of their images in the past but affirmed their reality in the present, immediately accessible to all men whom a contingent and consequently negligible circumstance did not compel to remain at home. On certain fine days the weather was so cold, one was in such full communication with the street that it seemed as though a breach had been made in the outer walls of the house, and, whenever a tramcar passed, the sound of its bell throbbed like that of a silver knife striking a wall of glass. But it was most of all in myself that I heard, with intoxication, a new sound rendered by the hidden violin. Its strings are tightened or relaxed by mere changes of temperature, of light, in the world outside. In our person, an instrument which the uniformity of habit has rendered silent, song is born of these digressions, these variations, the source of all music: the change of climate on certain days makes us pass at once from one note to another. We recapture the forgotten air the mathematical inevitability of which we might have deduced, and which for the first few moments we sing without recognising it. By themselves these modifications (which, albeit coming from without, were internal) refashioned for me the world outside. Communicating doors, long barred, opened themselves in my brain. The life of certain towns, the gaiety of certain expeditions resumed their place in my consciousness. All athrob in harmony with the vibrating string, I would have sacrificed my dull life in the past, and all my life to come, erased with the india-rubber of habit, for one of these special, unique moments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I had not gone out with Albertine on her long drive, my mind would stray all the farther afield, and, because I had refused to savour with my senses this particular morning, I enjoyed in imagination all the similar mornings, past or possible, or more precisely a certain type of morning of which all those of the same kind were but the intermittent apparition which I had at once recognised; for the keen air blew the book open of its own accord at the right page, and I found clearly set out before my eyes, so that I might follow it from my bed, the Gospel for the day. This ideal morning filled my mind full of a permanent reality, identical with all similar mornings, and infected me with a cheerfulness which my physical ill-health did not diminish: for, inasmuch as our sense of well-being is caused not so much by our sound health as by the unemployed surplus of our strength, we can attain to it, just as much as by increasing our strength, by diminishing our activity. The activity with which I was overflowing and which I kept constantly charged as I lay in bed, made me spring from side to side, with a leaping heart, like a machine which, prevented from moving in space, rotates on its own axis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise came in to light the fire, and to make it draw, threw upon it a handful of twigs, the scent of which, forgotten for a year past, traced round the fireplace a magic circle within which, perceiving myself poring over a book, now at Combray, now at Donci\u00e8res, I was as joyful, while remaining in my bedroom in Paris, as if I had been on the point of starting for a walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, or of going to join Saint-Loup and his friends on the training-ground. It often happens that the pleasure which everyone takes in turning over the keepsakes that his memory has collected is keenest in those whom the tyranny of bodily ill-health and the daily hope of recovery prevent, on the one hand, from going out to seek in nature scenes that resemble those memories, and, on the other hand, leave so convinced that they will shortly be able to do so that they can remain gazing at them in a state of desire, of appetite, and not regard them merely as memories, as pictures. But, even if they were never to be anything more than memories to me, even if I, as I recalled them, saw merely pictures, immediately they recreated in me, of me as a whole, by virtue of an identical sensation, the boy, the youth who had first seen them. There had been not merely a change in the weather outside, or, inside the room, the introduction of a fresh scent, there had been in myself a difference of age, the substitution of another person. The scent, in the frosty air, of the twigs of brushwood, was like a fragment of the past, an invisible floe broken off from the ice of an old winter that stole into my room, often variegated moreover with this perfume or that light, as though with a sequence of different years, in which I found myself plunged, overwhelmed, even before I had identified them, by the eagerness of hopes long since abandoned. The sun\u2019s rays fell upon my bed and passed through the transparent shell of my attenuated body, warmed me, made me as hot as a sheet of scorching crystal. Whereupon, a famished convalescent who has already begun to batten upon all the dishes that are still forbidden him, I asked myself whether marriage with Albertine would not spoil my life, as well by making me assume the burden, too heavy for my shoulders, of consecrating myself to another person, as by forcing me to live in absence from myself because of her continual presence and depriving me, forever, of the delights of solitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And not of these alone. Even when we ask of the day nothing but desires, there are some \u2014 those that are excited not by things but by people \u2014 whose character it is to be unlike any other. If, on rising from my bed, I went to the window and drew the curtain aside for a moment, it was not merely, as a pianist for a moment turns back the lid of his instrument, to ascertain whether, on the balcony and in the street, the sunlight was tuned to exactly the same pitch as in my memory, it was also to catch a glimpse of some laundress carrying her linen-basket, a bread-seller in her blue apron, a dairymaid in her tucker and sleeves of white linen, carrying the yoke from which her jugs of milk are suspended, some haughty golden-haired miss escorted by her governess, a composite image, in short, which the differences of outline, numerically perhaps insignificant, were enough to make as different from any other as, in a phrase of music, the difference between two notes, an image but for the vision of which I should have impoverished my day of the objects which it might have to offer to my desires of happiness. But, if the surfeit of joy, brought me by the spectacle of women whom it was impossible to imagine a priori, made more desirable, more deserving of exploration, the street, the town, the world, it set me longing, for that very reason, to recover my health, to go out of doors and, without Albertine, to be a free man. How often, at the moment when the unknown woman who was to haunt my dreams passed beneath the window, now on foot, now at the full speed of her motor-car, was I made wretched that my body could not follow my gaze which kept pace with her, and falling upon her as though shot from the embrasure of my window by an arquebus, arrest the flight of the face that held out for me the offer of a happiness which, cloistered thus, I should never know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of Albertine, on the other hand, I had nothing more to learn. Every day, she seemed to me less attractive. Only, the desire that she aroused in other people, when, upon hearing of it, I began to suffer afresh and was impelled to challenge their possession of her, raised her in my sight to a lofty pinnacle. Pain, she was capable of causing me; joy, never. Pain alone kept my tedious attachment alive. As soon as my pain vanished, and with it the need to soothe it, requiring all my attention, like some agonising distraction, I felt that she meant absolutely nothing to me, that I must mean absolutely nothing to her. It made me wretched that this state should persist, and, at certain moments, I longed to hear of something terrible that she had done, something that would be capable of keeping us at arms-length until I was cured, so that we might then be able to be reconciled, to refashion in a different and more flexible form the chain that bound us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, I was employing a thousand circumstances, a thousand pleasures to procure for her in my society the illusion of that happiness which I did not feel myself capable of giving her. I should have liked, as soon as I was cured, to set off for Venice, but how was I to manage it, if I married Albertine, I, who was so jealous of her that even in Paris whenever I decided to stir from my room it was to go out with her? Even when I stayed in the house all the afternoon, my thoughts accompanied her on her drive, traced a remote, blue horizon, created round the centre that was myself a fluctuating zone of vague uncertainty. \u201cHow completely,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cwould Albertine spare me the anguish of separation if, in the course of one of these drives, seeing that I no longer say anything to her about marriage, she decided not to come back, and went off to her aunt\u2019s, without my having to bid her good-bye!\u201d My heart, now that its scar had begun to heal, was ceasing to adhere to the heart of my mistress; I could by imagination shift her, separate her from myself without pain. No doubt, failing myself, some other man would be her husband, and in her freedom she would meet perhaps with those adventures which filled me with horror. But the day was so fine, I was so certain that she would return in the evening, that even if the idea of possible misbehaviour did enter my mind, I could, by an exercise of free will, imprison it in a part of my brain in which it had no more importance than would have had in my real life the vices of an imaginary person; bringing into play the supple hinges of my thought, I had, with an energy which I felt in my head to be at once physical and mental, as it were a muscular movement and a spiritual impulse, broken away from the state of perpetual preoccupation in which I had until then been confined, and was beginning to move in a free atmosphere, in which the idea of sacrificing everything in order to prevent Albertine from marrying some one else and to put an obstacle in the way of her fondness for women seemed as unreasonable to my own mind as to that of a person who had never known her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, jealousy is one of those intermittent maladies, the cause of which is capricious, imperative, always identical in the same patient, sometimes entirely different in another. There are asthmatic persons who can soothe their crises only by opening the windows, inhaling the full blast of the wind, the pure air of the mountains, others by taking refuge in the heart of the city, in a room heavy with smoke. Rare indeed is the jealous man whose jealousy does not allow certain concessions. One will consent to infidelity, provided that he is told of it, another provided that it is concealed from him, wherein they appear to be equally absurd, since if the latter is more literally deceived inasmuch as the truth is not disclosed to him, the other demands in that truth the food, the extension, the renewal of his sufferings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is more, these two parallel manias of jealousy extend often beyond words, whether they implore or reject confidences. We see a jealous lover who is jealous only of the women with whom his mistress has relations in his absence, but allows her to give herself to another man, if it is done with his authorisation, near at hand, and, if not actually before his eyes, under his roof. This case is not at all uncommon among elderly men who are in love with young women. Such a man feels the difficulty of winning her favour, sometimes his inability to satisfy her, and, rather than be betrayed, prefers to admit to his house, to an adjoining room, some man whom he considers incapable of giving her bad advice, but not incapable of giving her pleasure. With another man it is just the opposite; never allowing his mistress to go out by herself for a single minute in a town that he knows, he keeps her in a state of bondage, but allows her to go for a month to a place which he does not know, where he cannot form any mental picture of what she may be doing. I had with regard to Albertine both these sorts of sedative mania. I should not have been jealous if she had enjoyed her pleasures in my company, with my encouragement, pleasures over the whole of which I could have kept watch, thus avoiding any fear of falsehood; I might perhaps not have been jealous either if she had removed to a place so unfamiliar and remote that I could not imagine nor find any possibility, feel any temptation to know the manner of her life. In either alternative, my uncertainty would have been killed by a knowledge or an ignorance equally complete\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decline of day plunging me back by an act of memory in a cool atmosphere of long ago, I breathed it with the same delight with which Orpheus inhaled the subtle air, unknown upon this earth, of the Elysian Fields\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the day was ending and I was overpowered by the desolation of the evening. Looking mechanically at the clock to see how many hours must elapse before Albertine\u2019s return, I saw that I had still time to dress and go downstairs to ask my landlady, Mme. de Guermantes, for particulars of various becoming garments which I was anxious to procure for my mistress. Sometimes I met the Duchess in the courtyard, going out for a walk, even if the weather was bad, in a close-fitting hat and furs. I knew quite well that, to many people of intelligence, she was merely a lady like any other, the name Duchesse de Guermantes signifying nothing, now that there are no longer any sovereign Duchies or Principalities, but I had adopted a different point of view in my method of enjoying people and places. All the castles of the territories of which she was Duchess, Princess, Viscountess, this lady in furs defying the weather teemed to me to be carrying them on her person, as a figure carved over the lintel of a church door holds in his hand the cathedral that he has built or the city that he has defended. But these castles, these forests, my mind\u2019s eye alone could discern them in the left hand of the lady in furs, whom the King called cousin. My bodily eyes distinguished in it only, on days when the sky was threatening, an umbrella with which the Duchess was not afraid to arm herself. \u201cOne can never be certain, it is wiser, I may find myself miles from home, with a cabman demanding a fare beyond my means.\u201d The words \u2018too dear\u2019 and \u2018beyond my means\u2019 kept recurring all the time in the Duchess\u2019s conversation, as did also: \u2018I am too poor\u2019\u2014 without its being possible to decide whether she spoke thus because she thought it amusing to say that she was poor, being so rich, or because she thought it smart, being so aristocratic, in spite of her affectation of peasant ways, not to attach to riches the importance that people give them who are merely rich and nothing else, and who look down upon the poor. Perhaps it was, rather, a habit contracted at a time in her life when, already rich, but not rich enough to satisfy her needs, considering the expense of keeping up all those properties, she felt a certain shortage of money which she did not wish to appear to be concealing. The things about which we most often jest are generally, on the contrary, the things that embarrass us, but we do not wish to appear to be embarrassed by them, and feel perhaps a secret hope of the further advantage that the person to whom we are talking, hearing us treat the matter as a joke, will conclude that it is not true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But upon most evenings, at this hour, I could count upon finding the Duchess at home, and I was glad of this, for it was more convenient for me to ask her in detail for the information that Albertine required. And down I went almost without thinking how extraordinary it was that I should be calling upon that mysterious Mme. de Guermantes of my boyhood, simply in order to make use of her for a practical purpose, as one makes use of the telephone, a supernatural instrument before whose miracles we used to stand amazed, and which we now employ without giving it a thought, to summon our tailor or to order ices for a party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine delighted in any sort of finery. I could not deny myself the pleasure of giving her some new trifle every day. And whenever she had spoken to me with rapture of a scarf, a stole, a sunshade which, from the window or as they passed one another in the courtyard, her eyes that so quickly distinguished anything smart, had seen round the throat, over the shoulders, in the hand of Mme. de Guermantes, knowing how the girl\u2019s naturally fastidious taste (refined still further by the lessons in elegance of attire which Elstir\u2019s conversation had been to her) would not be at all satisfied by any mere substitute, even of a pretty thing, such as fills its place in the eyes of the common herd, but differs from it entirely, I went in secret to make the Duchess explain to me where, how, from what model the article had been created that had taken Albertine\u2019s fancy, how I should set about to obtain one exactly similar, in what the creator\u2019s secret, the charm (what Albertine called the \u2018chic\u2018 the \u2018style\u2019) of his manner, the precise name \u2014 the beauty of the material being of importance also \u2014 and quality of the stuffs that I was to insist upon their using\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I mentioned to Albertine, on our return from Balbec, that the Duchesse de Guermantes lived opposite to us, in the same mansion, she had assumed, on hearing the proud title and great name, that air more than indifferent, hostile, contemptuous, which is the sign of an impotent desire in proud and passionate natures. Splendid as Albertine\u2019s nature might be, the fine qualities which it contained were free to develop only amid those hindrances which are our personal tastes, or that lamentation for those of our tastes which we have been obliged to relinquish \u2014 in Albertine\u2019s case snobbishness \u2014 which is called antipathy. Albertine\u2019s antipathy to people in society occupied, for that matter, but a very small part in her nature, and appealed to me as an aspect of the revolutionary spirit \u2014 that is to say an embittered love of the nobility \u2014 engraved upon the opposite side of the French character to that which displays the aristocratic manner of Mme. de Guermantes. To this aristocratic manner Albertine, in view of the impossibility of her acquiring it, would perhaps not have given a thought, but remembering that Elstir had spoken to her of the Duchess as the best dressed woman in Paris, her republican contempt for a Duchess gave place in my mistress to a keen interest in a fashionable woman. She was always asking me to tell her about Mme. de Guermantes, and was glad that I should go to the Duchess to obtain advice as to her own attire. No doubt I might have got this from Mme. Swann and indeed I did once write to her with this intention. But Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me to carry to an even higher pitch the art of dressing. If, on going down for a moment to call upon her, after making sure that she had not gone out and leaving word that I was to be told as soon as Albertine returned, I found the Duchess swathed in the mist of a garment of grey cr\u00eape de chine, I accepted this aspect of her which I felt to be due to complex causes and to be quite inevitable, I let myself be overpowered by the atmosphere which it exhaled, like that of certain late afternoons cushioned in pearly grey by a vaporous fog; if, on the other hand, her indoor gown was Chinese with red and yellow flames, I gazed at it as at a glowing sunset; these garments were not a casual decoration alterable at her pleasure, but a definite and poetical reality like that of the weather, or the light peculiar to a certain hour of the day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of all the outdoor and indoor gowns that Mme. de Guermantes wore, those which seemed most to respond to a definite intention, to be endowed with a special significance, were the garments made by Fortuny from old Venetian models. Is it their historical character, is it rather the fact that each one of them is unique that gives them so special a significance that the pose of the woman who is wearing one while she waits for you to appear or while she talks to you assumes an exceptional importance, as though the costume had been the fruit of a long deliberation and your conversation was detached from the current of everyday life like a scene in a novel? In the novels of Balzac, we see his heroines purposely put on one or another dress on the day on which they are expecting some particular visitor. The dresses of to-day have less character, always excepting the creations of Fortuny. There is no room for vagueness in the novelist\u2019s description, since the gown does really exist, and the merest sketch of it is as naturally preordained as a copy of a work of art. Before putting on one or another of them, the woman has had to make a choice between two garments, not more or less alike but each one profoundly individual, and answering to its name. But the dress did not prevent me from thinking of the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me at this time more attractive than in the days when I was still in love with her. Expecting less of her (whom I no longer went to visit for her own sake), it was almost with the ease and comfort of a man in a room by himself, with his feet on the fender, that I listened to her as though I were reading a book written in the speech of long ago. My mind was sufficiently detached to enjoy in what she said that pure charm of the French language which we no longer find either in the speech or in the literature of the present day. I listened to her conversation as to a folk song deliciously and purely French, I realised that I would have allowed her to belittle Maeterlinck (whom for that matter she now admired, from a feminine weakness of intellect, influenced by those literary fashions whose rays spread slowly), as I realised that M\u00e9rim\u00e9e had belittled Baudelaire, Stendhal Balzac, Paul-Louis Courier Victor Hugo, Meilhac Mallarm\u00e9. I realised that the critic had a far more restricted outlook than his victim, but also a purer vocabulary. That of Mme. de Guermantes, almost as much as that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mother, was purified to an enchanting degree. It is not in the bloodless formulas of the writers of to-day, who say: au fait (for \u2018in reality\u2019), singuli\u00e8rement (for \u2018in particular\u2019), \u00e9tonn\u00e9 (for \u2018struck with amazement\u2019), and the like, that we recapture the old speech and the true pronunciation of words, but in conversing with a Mme. de Guermantes or a Fran\u00e7oise; I had learned from the latter, when I was five years old, that one did not say \u2018the Tarn\u2019 but \u2018the Tar\u2019; not \u2018Beam\u2019 but \u2018Bear.\u2019 The effect of which was that at twenty, when I began to go into society, I had no need to be taught there that one ought not to say, like Mme. Bontemps: \u2018Madame de Beam.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue to pretend that of this territorial and semi-peasant quality which survived in her the Duchess was not fully conscious, indeed she displayed a certain affectation in emphasising it. But, on her part, this was not so much the false simplicity of a great lady aping the countrywoman or the pride of a Duchess bent upon snubbing the rich ladies who express contempt for the peasants whom they do not know as the almost artistic preference of a woman who knows the charm of what belongs to her, and is not going to spoil it with a coat of modern varnish. In the same way, everybody will remember at Dives a Norman innkeeper, landlord of the Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant, who carefully refrained \u2014 which is very rare \u2014 from giving his hostelry the modern comforts of an hotel, and, albeit a millionaire, retained the speech, the blouse of a Norman peasant and allowed you to enter his kitchen and watch him prepare with his own hands, as in a farmhouse, a dinner which was nevertheless infinitely better and even more expensive than are the dinners in the most luxurious hotels\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the local sap that survives in the old noble families is not enough, there must also be born of them a person of sufficient intelligence not to despise it, not to conceal it beneath the varnish of society. Mme. de Guermantes, unfortunately clever and Parisian, who, when I first knew her, retained nothing of her native soil but its accent, had at least, when she wished to describe her life as a girl, found for her speech one of those compromises (between what would have seemed too spontaneously provincial on the one hand or artificially literary on the other), one of those compromises which form the attraction of George Sand\u2019s La Petite Fadette or of certain legends preserved by Chateaubriand in his M\u00e9moires d\u2019Outre-Tombe. My chief pleasure was in hearing her tell some anecdote which brought peasants into the picture with herself. The historic names, the old customs gave to these blendings of the castle with the village a distinctly attractive savour. Having remained in contact with the lands over which it once ruled, a certain class of the nobility has remained regional, with the result that the simplest remark unrolls before our eyes a political and physical map of the whole history of France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there was no affectation, no desire to fabricate a special language, then this manner of pronouncing words was a regular museum of French history displayed in conversation. \u2018My great-uncle Fitt-jam\u2019 was not at all surprising, for we know that the Fitz-James family are proud to boast that they are French nobles, and do not like to hear their name pronounced in the English fashion. One must, incidentally, admire the touching docility of the people who had previously supposed themselves obliged to pronounce certain names phonetically, and who, all of a sudden, after hearing the Duchesse de Guermantes pronounce them otherwise, adopted the pronunciation which they could never have guessed. Thus the Duchess, who had had a great-grandfather in the suite of the Comte de Chambord, liked to tease her husband for having turned Orleanist by proclaiming: \u201cWe old Frochedorf people. . . . \u201d The visitor, who had always imagined that he was correct in saying \u2018Frohsdorf,\u2019 at once turned his coat, and ever afterwards might be heard saying \u2018Frochedorf.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion when I asked Mme. de Guermantes who a young blood was whom she had introduced to me as her nephew but whose name I had failed to catch, I was none the wiser when from the back of her throat the Duchess uttered in a very loud but quite inarticulate voice: \u201cC\u2019est l\u2019 . . . i Eon . . . l . . . b . . . fr\u00e8re \u00e0 Robert. He makes out that he has the same shape of skull as the ancient Gauls.\u201d Then I realised that she had said: \u201cC\u2019est le petit L\u00e9on,\u201d and that this was the Prince de L\u00e9on, who was indeed Robert de Saint-Loup\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cI know nothing about his skull,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut the way he dresses, and I must say he does dress quite well, is not at all in the style of those parts. Once when I was staying at Josselin, with the Rohans, we all went over to one of the pilgrimages, where there were peasants from every part of Brittany. A great hulking fellow from one of the L\u00e9on villages stood gaping open-mouthed at Robert\u2019s brother-in-law in his beige breeches! \u2018What are you staring at me like that for?\u2019 said L\u00e9on. \u2018I bet you don\u2019t know who I am?\u2019 The peasant admitted that he did not. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said L\u00e9on, \u2018I\u2019m your Prince.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said the peasant, taking off his cap and apologising. \u2018I thought you were an Englische.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if, taking this opportunity, I led Mme. de Guermantes on to talk about the Rohans (with whom her own family had frequently intermarried), her conversation would become impregnated with a hint of the wistful charm of the Pardons, and (as that true poet Pampille would say) with \u201cthe harsh savour of pancakes of black grain fried over a fire of rushes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the Marquis du Lau (whose tragic decline we all know, when, himself deaf, he used to be taken to call on Mme. H . . . who was blind), she would recall the less tragic years when, after the day\u2019s sport, at Guermantes, he would change into slippers before taking tea with the Prince of Wales, to whom he would not admit himself inferior, and with whom, as we see, he stood upon no ceremony. She described all this so picturesquely that she seemed to invest him with the plumed musketeer bonnet of the somewhat vainglorious gentlemen of the P\u00e9rigord\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even in the mere classification of different people, her care to distinguish and indicate their native provinces was in Mme. de Guermantes, when she was her natural self, a great charm which a Parisian-born woman could never have acquired, and those simple names Anjou, Poitou, the P\u00e9rigord, filled her conversation with pictorial landscapes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to the pronunciation and vocabulary of Mme. de Guermantes, it is in this aspect that the nobility shews itself truly conservative, with everything that the word implies at once somewhat puerile and somewhat perilous, stubborn in its resistance to evolution but interesting also to an artist. I was anxious to know the original spelling of the name Jean. I learned it when I received a letter from a nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis who signs himself \u2014 as he was christened, as he figures in Gotha \u2014 Jehan de Villeparisis, with the same handsome, superfluous, heraldic h that we admire, illuminated in vermilion or ultramarine in a Book of Hours or in a window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I never had time to prolong these visits indefinitely, for I was anxious, if possible, not to return home after my mistress. But it was only in driblets that I was able to obtain from Mme. de Guermantes that information as to her garments which was of use in helping me to order garments similar in style, so far as it was possible for a young girl to wear them, for Albertine. \u201cFor instance, Madame, that evening when you dined with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and then went on to the Princesse de Guermantes, you had a dress that was all red, with red shoes, you were marvellous, you reminded me of a sort of great blood-red blossom, a blazing ruby \u2014 now, what was that dress? Is it the sort of thing that a girl can wear?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess, imparting to her tired features the radiant expression that the Princesse des Laumes used to assume when Swann, in years past, paid her compliments, looked, with tears of merriment in her eyes, quizzingly, questioningly and delightedly at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 who was always there at that hour and who set beaming from behind his monocle a smile that seemed to pardon this outburst of intellectual trash for the sake of the physical excitement of youth which seemed to him to lie beneath it. The Duchess appeared to be saying: \u201cWhat is the matter with him? He must be mad.\u201d Then turning to me with a coaxing air: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I looked like a blazing ruby or a blood-red blossom, but I do remember, as it happens, that I had on a red dress: it was red satin, which was being worn that season. Yes, a girl can wear that sort of thing at a pinch, but you told me that your friend never went out in the evening. That is a full evening dress, not a thing that she can put on to pay calls.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is extraordinary is that of the evening in question, which after all was not so very remote, Mme. de Guermantes should remember nothing but what she had been wearing, and should have forgotten a certain incident which nevertheless, as we shall see presently, ought to have mattered to her greatly. It seems that among men and women of action (and people in society are men and women of action on a minute, a microscopic scale, but are nevertheless men and women of action), the mind, overcharged by the need of attending to what is going to happen in an hour\u2019s time, confides only a very few things to the memory. As often as not, for instance, it was not with the object of putting his questioner in the wrong and making himself appear not to have been mistaken that M. de Norpois, when you reminded him of the prophecies he had uttered with regard to an alliance with Germany of which nothing had ever come, would say: \u201cYou must be mistaken, I have no recollection of it whatever, it is not like me, for in that sort of conversation I am always most laconic, and I would never have predicted the success of one of those coups d\u2019\u00e9clat which are often nothing more than coups de t\u00eate and almost always degenerate into coups de force. It is beyond question that in the remote future a Franco-German rapprochement might come into being and would be highly profitable to both countries, nor would France have the worse of the bargain, I dare say, but I have never spoken of it because the fruit is not yet ripe, and if you wish to know my opinion, in asking our late enemies to join with us in solemn wedlock, I consider that we should be setting out to meet a severe rebuff, and that the attempt could end only in disaster.\u201d In saying this M. de Norpois was not being untruthful, he had simply forgotten. We quickly forget what we have not deeply considered, what has been dictated to us by the spirit of imitation, by the passions of our neighbours. These change, and with them our memory undergoes alteration. Even more than diplomats, politicians are unable to remember the point of view which they adopted at a certain moment, and some of their palinodes are due less to a surfeit of ambition than to a shortage of memory. As for people in society, there are very few things that they remember\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes assured me that, at the party to which she had gone in a red gown, she did not remember Mme. de Chaussepierre\u2019s being present, and that I must be mistaken. And yet, heaven knows, the Chaussepierres had been present enough in the minds of both Duke and Duchess since then. For the following reason. M. de Guermantes had been the senior vice-president of the Jockey, when the president died. Certain members of the club who were not popular in society and whose sole pleasure was to blackball the men who did not invite them to their houses started a campaign against the Duc de Guermantes who, certain of being elected, and relatively indifferent to the presidency which was a small matter for a man in his social position, paid no attention. It was urged against him that the Duchess was a Dreyfusard (the Dreyfus case had long been concluded, but twenty years later people were still talking about it, and so far only two years had elapsed), and entertained the Rothschilds, that so much consideration had been shewn of late to certain great international magnates like the Duc de Guermantes, who was half German. The campaign found its ground well prepared, clubs being always jealous of men who are in the public eye, and detesting great fortunes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chaussepierre\u2019s own fortune was no mere pittance, but nobody could take offence at it; he never spent a penny, the couple lived in a modest apartment, the wife went about dressed in black serge. A passionate music-lover, she did indeed give little afternoon parties to which many more singers were invited than to the Guermantes. But no one ever mentioned these parties, no refreshments were served, the husband did not put in an appearance even, and everything went off quite quietly in the obscurity of the Rue de la Chaise. At the Opera, Mme. de Chaussepierre passed unnoticed, always among people whose names recalled the most \u2018die-hard\u2019 element of the intimate circle of Charles X, but people quite obsolete, who went nowhere. On the day of the election, to the general surprise, obscurity triumphed over renown: Chaussepierre, the second vice-president, was elected president of the Jockey, and the Duc de Guermantes was left sitting \u2014 that is to say, in the senior vice-president\u2019s chair. Of course, being president of the Jockey means little or nothing to Princes of the highest rank such as the Guermantes. But not to be it when it is your turn, to see preferred to you a Chaussepierre to whose wife Oriane, two years earlier, had not merely refused to bow but had taken offence that an unknown scarecrow like that should bow to her, this the Duke did find hard to endure. He pretended to be superior to this rebuff, asserting moreover that it was his long-standing friendship with Swann that was at the root of it. Actually his anger never cooled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One curious thing was that nobody had ever before heard the Duc de Guermantes make use of the quite commonplace expression \u2018out and out,\u2019 but ever since the Jockey election, whenever anybody referred to the Dreyfus case, pat would come \u2018out and out.\u2019\u201cDreyfus case, Dreyfus case, that\u2019s soon said, and it\u2019s a misuse of the term. It is not a question of religion, it\u2019s out and out a political matter.\u201d Five years might go by without your hearing him say \u2018out and out\u2019 again, if during that time nobody mentioned the Dreyfus case, but if, at the end of five years, the name Dreyfus cropped up, \u2018out and out\u2019 would at once follow automatically. The Duke could not, anyhow, bear to hear any mention of the case, \u201cwhich has been responsible,\u201d he would say, \u201cfor so many disasters\u201d albeit he was really conscious of one and one only; his own failure to become president of the Jockey. And so on the afternoon in question, when I reminded Madame de Guermantes of the red gown that she had worn at her cousin\u2019s party, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was none too well received when, determined to say something, by an association of ideas which remained obscure and which he did not illuminate, he began, twisting his tongue about between his pursed lips: \u201cTalking of the Dreyfus case \u2014\u201d (why in the world of the Dreyfus case, we were talking simply of a red dress, and certainly poor Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose only desire was to make himself agreeable, can have had no malicious intention). But the mere name of Dreyfus made the Duc de Guermantes knit his Jupiterian brows. \u201cI was told,\u201d Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 went on, \u201ca jolly good thing, damned clever, \u2018pon my word, that was said by our friend Cartier\u201d (we must warn the reader that this Cartier, Mme. de Villefranche\u2019s brother, was in no way related to the jeweller of that name) \u201cnot that I\u2019m in the least surprised, for he\u2019s got plenty of brains to spare,\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d broke in Oriane, \u201che can spare me his brains. I hardly like to tell you how much your friend Cartier has always bored me, and I have never been able to understand the boundless charm that Charles de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle and his wife seem to find in the creature, for I meet him there every time that I go to their house.\u201d \u201cMy dear Dutt-yess,\u201d replied Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who was unable to pronounce the soft c, \u201cI think you are very hard upon Cartier. It is true that he has perhaps made himself rather too mutt-y-at home at the La Tr\u00e9-mo\u00eflles\u2019, but after all he does provide Tyarles with a sort of \u2014 what shall I say? \u2014 a sort of fidus Achates, which has become a very rare bird indeed in these days. Anyhow, this is the story as it was told to me. Cartier appears to have said that if M. Zola had gone out of his way to stand his trial and to be convicted, it was in order to enjoy the only sensation he had never yet tried, that of being in prison.\u201d \u201cAnd so he ran away before they could arrest him,\u201d Oriane broke in. \u201cYour story doesn\u2019t hold water. Besides, even if it was plausible, I think his remark absolutely idiotic. If that\u2019s what you call being witty!\u201d \u201cGood grate-ious, my dear Oriane,\u201d replied Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 who, finding himself contradicted, was beginning to lose confidence, \u201cit\u2019s not my remark, I\u2019m telling you it as it was told to me, take it for what\u2019s it worth. Anyhow, it earned M. Cartier a first rate blowing up from that excellent fellow La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle who, and quite rightly, does not like people to discuss what one might call, so to speak, current events, in his drawing-room, and was all the more annoyed because Mme. Alphonse Rothschild was present. Cartier had to listen to a positive jobation from La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u201d \u201cI should think so,\u201d said the Duke, in the worst of tempers, \u201cthe Alphonse Rothschilds, even if they have the tact never to speak of that abominable affair, are Dreyfusards at heart, like all the Jews. Indeed that is an argument ad hominem\u201c (the Duke was a trifle vague in his use of the expression ad hominem) \u201cwhich is not sufficiently made use of to prove the dishonesty of the Jews. If a Frenchman robs or murders somebody, I do not consider myself bound, because he is a Frenchman like myself, to find him innocent. But the Jews will never admit that one of their fellow-countrymen is a traitor, although they know it perfectly well, and never think of the terrible repercussions\u201d (the Duke was thinking, naturally, of that accursed defeat by Chaussepierre) \u201cwhich the crime of one of their people can bring even to . . . Come, Oriane, you\u2019re not going to pretend that it ain\u2019t damning to the Jews that they all support a traitor. You\u2019re not going to tell me that it ain\u2019t because they\u2019re Jews.\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d retorted Oriane (feeling, with a trace of irritation, a certain desire to hold her own against Jupiter Tonans and also to set \u2018intellect\u2019 above the Dreyfus case). \u201cPerhaps it is just because they are Jews and know their own race that they realise that a person can be a Jew and not necessarily a traitor and anti-French, as M. Drumont seems to maintain. Certainly, if he\u2019d been a Christian, the Jews wouldn\u2019t have taken any interest in him, but they did so because they knew quite well that if he hadn\u2019t been a Jew people wouldn\u2019t have been so ready to think him a traitor a priori, as my nephew Robert would say.\u201d \u201cWomen never understand a thing about politics,\u201d exclaimed the Duke, fastening his gaze upon the Duchess. \u201cThat shocking crime is not simply a Jewish cause, but out and out an affair of vast national importance which may lead to the most appalling consequences for France, which ought to have driven out all the Jews, whereas I am sorry to say that the measures taken up to the present have been directed (in an ignoble fashion, which will have to be overruled) not against them but against the most eminent of their adversaries, against men of the highest rank, who have been flung into the gutter, to the ruin of our unhappy country.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that the conversation had taken a wrong turning and reverted hurriedly to the topic of clothes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you remember, Madame,\u201d I said, \u201cthe first time that you were friendly with me?\u201d \u201cThe first time that I was friendly with him,\u201d she repeated, turning with a smile to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the tip of whose nose grew more pointed, his smile more tender out of politeness to Mme. de Guermantes, while his voice, like a knife on the grindstone, emitted various vague and rusty sounds. \u201cYou were wearing a yellow gown with big black flowers.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear boy, that\u2019s the same thing, those are evening dresses.\u201d \u201cAnd your hat with the cornflowers that I liked so much! Still, those are all things of the past. I should like to order for the girl I mentioned to you a fur cloak like the one you had on yesterday morning. Would it be possible for me to see it?\u201d \u201cOf course; Hannibal has to be going in a moment. You shall come to my room and my maid will shew you anything you want to look at. Only, my dear boy, though I shall be delighted to lend you anything, I must warn you that if you have things from Callot\u2019s or Doucet\u2019s or Paquin\u2019s copied by some small dressmaker, the result is never the same.\u201d \u201cBut I never dreamed of going to a small dressmaker, I know quite well it wouldn\u2019t be the same thing, but I should be interested to hear you explain why.\u201d \u201cYou know quite well I can never explain anything, I am a perfect fool, I talk like a peasant. It is a question of handiwork, of style; as far as furs go, I can at least give you a line to my furrier, so that he shan\u2019t rob you. But you realise that even then it will cost you eight or nine thousand francs.\u201d \u201cAnd that indoor gown that you were wearing the other evening, with such a curious smell, dark, fluffy, speckled, streaked with gold like a butterfly\u2019s wing?\u201d \u201cAh! That is one of Fortuny\u2019s. Your young lady can quite well wear that in the house. I have heaps of them; you shall see them presently, in fact I can give you one or two if you like. But I should like you to see one that my cousin Talleyrand has. I must write to her for the loan of it.\u201d \u201cBut you had such charming shoes as well, are they Fortuny\u2019s too?\u201d \u201cNo, I know the ones you mean, they are made of some gilded kid we came across in London, when I was shopping with Consuelo Manchester. It was amazing. I could never make out how they did it, it was just like a golden skin, simply that with a tiny diamond in front. The poor Duchess of Manchester is dead, but if it\u2019s any help to you I can write and ask Lady Warwick or the Duchess of Marlborough to try and get me some more. I wonder, now, if I haven\u2019t a piece of the stuff left. You might be able to have a pair made here. I shall look for it this evening, and let you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I endeavoured as far as possible to leave the Duchess before Albertine had returned, it often happened that I met in the courtyard as I came away from her door M. de Charlus and Morel on their way to take tea at Jupien\u2019s, a supreme favour for the Baron. I did not encounter them every day but they went there every day. Here we may perhaps remark that the regularity of a habit is generally in proportion to its absurdity. The sensational things, we do as a rule only by fits and starts. But the senseless life, in which the maniac deprives himself of all pleasure and inflicts the greatest discomforts upon himself, is the type that alters least. Every ten years, if we had the curiosity to inquire, we should find the poor wretch still asleep at the hours when he might be living his life, going out at the hours when there is nothing to do but let oneself be murdered in the streets, sipping iced drinks when he is hot, still trying desperately to cure a cold. A slight impulse of energy, for a single day, would be sufficient to change these habits for good and all. But the fact is that this sort of life is almost always the appanage of a person devoid of energy. Vices are another aspect of these monotonous existences which the exercise of will power would suffice to render less painful. These two aspects might be observed simultaneously when M. de Charlus came every day with Morel to take tea at Jupien\u2019s. A single outburst had marred this daily custom. The tailor\u2019s niece having said one day to Morel: \u201cThat\u2019s all right then, come to-morrow and I\u2019ll stand you a tea,\u201d the Baron had quite justifiably considered this expression very vulgar on the lips of a person whom he regarded as almost a prospective daughter-in-law, but as he enjoyed being offensive and became carried away by his own anger, instead of simply saying to Morel that he begged him to give her a lesson in polite manners, the whole of their homeward walk was a succession of violent scenes. In the most insolent, the most arrogant tone: \u201cSo your \u2018touch\u2019 which, I can see, is not necessarily allied to \u2018tact,\u2019 has hindered the normal development of your sense of smell, since you could allow that fetid expression \u2018stand a tea\u2019\u2014 at fifteen centimes, I suppose \u2014 to waft its stench of sewage to my regal nostrils? When you have come to the end of a violin solo, have you ever seen yourself in my house rewarded with a fart, instead of frenzied applause, or a silence more eloquent still, since it is due to exhaustion from the effort to restrain, not what your young woman lavishes upon you, but the sob that you have brought to my lips?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a public official has had similar reproaches heaped upon him by his chief, he invariably loses his post next day. Nothing, on the contrary, could have been more painful to M. de Charlus than to dismiss Morel, and, fearing indeed that he had gone a little too far, he began to sing the girl\u2019s praises in detailed terms, with an abundance of good taste mingled with impertinence. \u201cShe is charming; as you are a musician, I suppose that she seduced you by her voice, which is very beautiful in the high notes, where she seems to await the accompaniment of your B sharp. Her lower register appeals to me less, and that must bear some relation to the triple rise of her strange and slender throat, which when it seems to have come to an end begins again; but these are trivial details, it is her outline that I admire. And as she is a dressmaker and must be handy with her scissors, you must make her give me a charming silhouette of herself cut out in paper.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie had paid but little attention to this eulogy, the charms which it extolled in his betrothed having completely escaped his notice. But he said, in reply to M. de Charlus: \u201cThat\u2019s all right, my boy, I shall tell her off properly, and she won\u2019t talk like that again.\u201d If Morel addressed M. de Charlus thus as his \u2018boy,\u2019 it was not that the good-looking violinist was unaware that his own years numbered barely a third of the Baron\u2019s. Nor did he use the expression as Jupien would have done, but with that simplicity which in certain relations postulates that a suppression of the difference in age has tacitly preceded affection. A feigned affection on Morel\u2019s part. In others, a sincere affection. Thus, about this time M. de Charlus received a letter worded as follows: \u201cMy dear Palam\u00e8de, when am I going to see thee again? I am longing terribly for thee and always thinking of thee. PIERRE.\u201d M. de Charlus racked his brains to discover which of his relatives it could be that took the liberty of addressing him so familiarly, and must consequently know him intimately, although he failed to recognise the handwriting. All the Princes to whom the Almanach de Gotha accords a few lines passed in procession for days on end through his mind. And then, all of a sudden, an address written on the back of the letter enlightened him: the writer was the page at a gambling club to which M. de Charlus sometimes went. This page had not felt that he was being discourteous in writing in this tone to M. de Charlus, for whom on the contrary he felt the deepest respect. But he thought that it would not be civil not to address in the second person singular a gentleman who had many times kissed one, and thereby \u2014 he imagined in his simplicity \u2014 bestowed his affection. M. de Charlus was really delighted by this familiarity. He even brought M. de Vaugoubert away from an afternoon party in order to shew him the letter. And yet, heaven knows that M. de Charlus did not care to go about with M. de Vaugoubert. For the latter, his monocle in his eye, kept gazing in all directions at every passing youth. What was worse, emancipating himself when he was with M. de Charlus, he employed a form of speech which the Baron detested. He gave feminine endings to all the masculine words and, being intensely stupid, imagined this pleasantry to be extremely witty, and was continually in fits of laughter. As at the same time he attached enormous importance to his position in the diplomatic service, these deplorable outbursts of merriment in the street were perpetually interrupted by the shock caused him by the simultaneous appearance of somebody in society, or, worse still, of a civil servant. \u201cThat little telegraph messenger,\u201d he said, nudging the disgusted Baron with his elbow, \u201cI used to know her, but she\u2019s turned respectable, the wretch! Oh, that messenger from the Galeries Lafayette, what a dream! Good God, there\u2019s the head of the Commercial Department. I hope he didn\u2019t notice anything. He\u2019s quite capable of mentioning it to the Minister, who would put me on the retired list, all the more as, it appears, he\u2019s so himself.\u201d M. de Charlus was speechless with rage. At length, to bring this infuriating walk to an end, he decided to produce the letter and give it to the Ambassador to read, but warned him to be discreet, for he liked to pretend that Charlie was jealous, in order to be able to make people think that he was enamoured. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added with an indescribable air of benevolence, \u201cwe ought always to try to cause as little trouble as possible.\u201d Before we come back to Jupien\u2019s shop, the author would like to say how deeply he would regret it should any reader be offended by his portrayal of such unusual characters. On the one hand (and this is the less important aspect of the matter), it may be felt that the aristocracy is, in these pages, disproportionately accused of degeneracy in comparison with the other classes of society. Were this true, it would be in no way surprising. The oldest families end by displaying, in a red and bulbous nose, or a deformed chin, characteristic signs in which everyone admires \u2018blood.\u2019 But among these persistent and perpetually developing features, there are others that are not visible, to wit tendencies and tastes. It would be a more serious objection, were there any foundation for it, to say that all this is alien to us, and that we ought to extract truth from the poetry that is close at hand. Art extracted from the most familiar reality does indeed exist and its domain is perhaps the largest of any. But it is no less true that a strong interest, not to say beauty, may be found in actions inspired by a cast of mind so remote from anything that we feel, from anything that we believe, that we cannot ever succeed in understanding them, that they are displayed before our eyes like a spectacle without rhyme or reason. What eould be more poetic than Xerxes, son of Darius, ordering the sea to be scourged with rods for having engulfed his fleet?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may be certain that Morel, relying on the influence which his personal attractions give him over the girl, communicated to her, as coming from himself, the Baron\u2019s criticism, for the expression \u2018stand you a tea\u2019 disappeared as completely from the tailor\u2019s shop as disappears from a drawing-room some intimate friend who used to call daily, and with whom, for one reason or another, we have quarrelled, or whom we are trying to keep out of sight and meet only outside the house. M. de Charlus was satisfied by the cessation of \u2018stand you a tea.\u2019 He saw in it a proof of his own ascendancy over Morel and the removal of its one little blemish from the girl\u2019s perfection. In short, like everyone of his kind, while genuinely fond of Morel and of the girl who was all but engaged to him, an ardent advocate of their marriage, he thoroughly enjoyed his power to create at his pleasure more or less inoffensive little scenes, aloof from and above which he himself remained as Olympian as his brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel had told M. de Charlus that he was in love with Jupien\u2019s niece, and wished to marry her, and the Baron liked to accompany his young friend upon visits in which he played the part of father-in-law to be, indulgent and discreet. Nothing pleased him better\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My personal opinion is that \u2018stand you a tea\u2019 had originated with Morel himself, and that in the blindness of her love the young seamstress had adopted an expression from her beloved which clashed horribly with her own pretty way of speaking. This way of speaking, the charming manners that went with it, the patronage of M. de Charlus brought it about that many customers for whom she had worked received her as a friend, invited her to dinner, introduced her to their friends, though the girl accepted their invitations only with the Baron\u2019s permission and on the evenings that suited him. \u201cA young seamstress received in society?\u201d the reader will exclaim, \u201chow improbable!\u201d If you come to think of it, it was no less improbable that at one time Albertine should have come to see me at midnight, and that she should now be living in my house. And yet this might perhaps have been improbable of anyone else, but not of Albertine, a fatherless and motherless orphan, leading so uncontrolled a life that at first I had taken her, at Balbec, for the mistress of a bicyclist, a girl whose next of kin was Mme. Bontemps who in the old days, at Mme. Swann\u2019s, had admired nothing about her niece but her bad manners and who now shut her eyes, especially if by doing so she might be able to get rid of her by securing for her a wealthy marriage from which a little of the wealth would trickle into the aunt\u2019s pocket (in the highest society, a mother who is very well-born and quite penniless, when she has succeeded in finding a rich bride for her son, allows the young couple to support her, accepts presents of furs, a motor-car, money from a daughter-in-law whom she does not like but whom she introduces to her friends)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day may come when dressmakers \u2014 nor should I find it at all shocking \u2014 will move in society. Jupien\u2019s niece being an exception affords us no base for calculation, for one swallow does not make a summer. In any case, if the very modest advancement of Jupien\u2019s niece did scandalise some people, Morel was not among them, for, in certain respects, his stupidity was so intense that not only did he label \u2018rather a fool\u2019 this girl a thousand times cleverer than himself, and foolish only perhaps in her love for himself, but he actually took to be adventuresses, dressmakers\u2019 assistants in disguise playing at being ladies, the persons of rank and position who invited her to their houses and whose invitations she accepted without a trace of vanity. Naturally these were not Guermantes, nor even people who knew the Guermantes, but rich and smart women of the middle-class, broad-minded enough to feel that it is no disgrace to invite a dressmaker to your house and at the same time servile enough to derive some satisfaction from patronising a girl whom His Highness the Baron de Charlus was in the habit \u2014 without any suggestion, of course, of impropriety \u2014 of visiting daily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing could have pleased the Baron more than the idea of this marriage, for he felt that in this way Morel would not be taken from him. It appears that Jupien\u2019s niece had been, when scarcely more than a child, \u2018in trouble.\u2019 And M. de Charlus, while he sang her praises to Morel, would have had no hesitation in revealing this secret to his friend, who would be furious, and thus sowing the seeds of discord. For M. de Charlus, although terribly malicious, resembled a great many good people who sing the praises of some man or woman, as a proof of their own generosity, but would avoid like poison the soothing words, so rarely uttered, that would be capable of putting an end to strife. Notwithstanding this, the Baron refrained from making any insinuation, and for two reasons. \u201cIf I tell him,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cthat his ladylove is not spotless, his vanity will be hurt, he will be angry with me. Besides, how am I to know that he is not in love with her? If I say nothing, this fire of straw will burn itself out before long, I shall be able to control their relations as I choose, he will love her only to the extent that I shall allow. If I tell him of his young lady\u2019s past transgression, who knows that my Charlie is not still sufficiently enamoured of her to become jealous. Then I shall by my own doing be converting a harmless and easily controlled flirtation into a serious passion, which is a difficult thing to manage.\u201d For these reasons, M. de Charlus preserved a silence which had only the outward appearance of discretion, but was in another respect meritorious, since it is almost impossible for men of his sort to hold their tongues\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, the girl herself was charming, and M. de Charlus, who found that she satisfied all the aesthetic interest that he was capable of feeling in women, would have liked to have hundreds of photographs of her. Not such a fool as Morel, he was delighted to hear the names of the ladies who invited her to their houses, and whom his social instinct was able to place, but he took care (as he wished to retain his power) not to mention this to Charlie who, a regular idiot in this respect, continued to believe that, apart from the \u2018violin class\u2019 and the Verdurins, there existed only the Guermantes, and the few almost royal houses enumerated by the Baron, all the rest being but \u2018dregs\u2019 or \u2018scum.\u2019 Charlie interpreted these expressions of M. de Charlus literally\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the reasons which made M. de Charlus look forward to the marriage of the young couple was this, that Jupien\u2019s niece would then be in a sense an extension of Morel\u2019s personality, and so of the Baron\u2019s power over and knowledge of him. As for \u2018betraying\u2019 in the conjugal sense the violinist\u2019s future wife, it would never for a moment have occurred to M. de Charlus to feel the slightest scruple about that. But to have a \u2018young couple\u2019 to manage, to feel himself the redoubtable and all-powerful protector of Morel\u2019s wife, who if she regarded the Baron as a god would thereby prove that Morel had inculcated this idea into her, and would thus contain in herself something of Morel, added a new variety to the form of M. de Charlus\u2019s domination and brought to light in his \u2018creature,\u2019 Morel, a creature the more, that is to say gave the Baron something different, new, curious, to love in him. Perhaps even this domination would be stronger now than it had ever been. For whereas Morel by himself, naked so to speak, often resisted the Baron whom he felt certain of reconquering, once he was married, the thought of his home, his house, his future would alarm him more quickly, he would offer to M. de Charlus\u2019s desires a wider surface, an easier hold. All this, and even, failing anything else, on evenings when he was bored, the prospect of stirring up trouble between husband and wife (the Baron had never objected to battle-pictures) was pleasing to him. Less pleasing, however, than the thought of the state of dependence upon himself in which the young people would live. M. de Charlus\u2019s love for Morel acquired a delicious novelty when he said to himself: \u201cHis wife too will be mine just as much as he is, they will always take care not to annoy me, they will obey my caprices, and thus she will be a sign (which hitherto I have failed to observe) of what I had almost forgotten, what is so very dear to my heart, that to all the world, to everyone who sees that I protect them, house them, to myself, Morel is mine.\u201d This testimony in the eyes of the world and in his own pleased M. de Charlus more than anything. For the possession of what we love is an even greater joy than love itself. Very often those people who conceal this possession from the world do so only from the fear that the beloved object may be taken from them. And their happiness is diminished by this prudent reticence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reader may remember that Morel had once told the Baron that his great ambition was to seduce some young girl, and this girl in particular, that to succeed in his enterprise he would promise to marry her, and, the outrage accomplished, would \u2018cut his hook\u2019; but this confession, what with the declarations of love for Jupien\u2019s niece which Morel had come and poured out to him, M. de Charlus had forgotten. What was more, Morel had quite possibly forgotten it himself. There was perhaps a real gap between Morel\u2019s nature \u2014 as he had cynically admitted, perhaps even artfully exaggerated it \u2014 and the moment at which it would regain control of him. As he became better acquainted with the girl, she had appealed to him, he began to like her. He knew himself so little that he doubtless imagined that he was in love with her, perhaps indeed that he would be in love with her always. To be sure his initial desire, his criminal intention remained, but glossed over by so many layers of sentiment that there is nothing to shew that the violinist would not have been sincere in saying that this vicious desire was not the true motive of his action. There was, moreover, a brief period during which, without his actually admitting it to himself, this marriage appeared to him to be necessary. Morel was suffering at the time from violent cramp in the hand, and found himself obliged to contemplate the possibility of his having to give up the violin. As, in everything but his art, he was astonishingly lazy, the question who was to maintain him loomed before him, and he preferred that it should be Jupien\u2019s niece rather than M. de Charlus, this arrangement offering him greater freedom and also a wider choice of several kinds of women, ranging from the apprentices, perpetually changing, whom he would make Jupien\u2019s niece debauch for him, to the rich and beautiful ladies to whom he would prostitute her. That his future wife might refuse to lend herself to these arrangements, that she could be so perverse never entered Morel\u2019s calculations for a moment. However, they passed into the background, their place being taken by pure love, now that his cramp had ceased. His violin would suffice, together with his allowance from M. de Charlus, whose claims upon him would certainly be reduced once he, Morel, was married to the girl. Marriage was the urgent thing, because of his love, and in the interest of his freedom. He made a formal offer of marriage to Jupien, who consulted his niece. This was wholly unnecessary. The girl\u2019s passion for the violinist streamed round about her, like her hair when she let it down, like the joy in her beaming eyes. In Morel, almost everything that was agreeable or advantageous to him awakened moral emotions and words to correspond, sometimes even melting him to tears. It was therefore sincerely \u2014 if such a word can be applied to him \u2014 that he addressed Jupien\u2019s niece in speeches as steeped in sentimentality (sentimental too are the speeches that so many young noblemen who look forward to a life of complete idleness address to some charming daughter of a middle-class millionaire) as had been steeped in unredeemed vileness the speech he had made to M. de Charlus about the seduction and deflowering of a virgin. Only there was another side to this virtuous enthusiasm for a person who afforded him pleasure and the solemn engagement that he made with her. As soon as the person ceased to afford him pleasure, or indeed if, for example, the obligation to fulfil the promise that he had made caused him displeasure, she at once became the object ef an antipathy which he justified in his own eyes and which, after some neurasthenic disturbance, enabled him to prove to himself, as soon as the balance of his nervous system was restored, that he was, even looking at the matter from a purely virtuous point of view, released from any obligation. Thus, towards the end of his stay at Balbec, he had managed somehow to lose all his money and, not daring to mention the matter to M. de Charlus, looked about for some one to whom he might appeal. He had learned from his father (who at the same time had forbidden him ever to become a \u2018sponger\u2019) that in such circumstances the correct thing is to write to the person whom you intend to ask for a loan, \u201cthat you have to speak to him on business,\u201d to \u201cask him for a business appointment.\u201d This magic formula had so enchanted Morel that he would, I believe, have been glad to lose his money, simply to have the pleasure of asking for an appointment \u2018on business.\u2019 In the course of his life he had found that the formula had not quite the virtue that he supposed. He had discovered that certain people, to whom otherwise he would never have written at all, did not reply within five minutes of receiving his letter asking to speak to them \u2018on business.\u2019 If the afternoon went by without his receiving an answer, it never occurred to him that, to put the best interpretation on the matter, it was quite possible that the gentleman addressed had not yet come home, or had had other letters to write, if indeed he had not gone away from home altogether, fallen ill, or something of that sort. If by an extraordinary stroke of fortune Morel was given an appointment for the following morning, he would accost his intended creditor with: \u201cI was quite surprised not to get an answer, I was wondering if there was anything wrong with you, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re quite well,\u201d and so forth. Well then, at Balbec, and without telling me that he wished to talk \u2018business\u2019 to him, he had asked me to introduce him to that very Bloch to whom he had made himself so unpleasant a week earlier in the train. Bloch had not hesitated to lend him \u2014 or rather to secure a loan for him, from M. Nissim Bernard, of five thousand francs. From that moment Morel had worshipped Bloch. He asked himself with tears in his eyes how he could shew his indebtedness to a person who had saved his life. Finally, I undertook to ask on his behalf for a thousand francs monthly from M. de Charlus, a sum which he would at once forward to Bloch who would thus find himself repaid within quite a short time. The first month, Morel, still under the impression of Bloch\u2019s generosity, sent him the thousand francs immediately, but after this he doubtless found that a different application of the remaining four thousand francs might be more satisfactory to himself, for he began to say all sorts of unpleasant things about Bloch. The mere sight of Bloch was enough to fill his mind with dark thoughts, and Bloch himself having forgotten the exact amount that he had lent Morel, and having asked him for 3,500 francs instead of 4,000 which would have left the violinist 500 francs to the good, the latter took the line that, in view of so preposterous a fraud, not only would he not pay another centime but his creditor might think himself very fortunate if Morel did not bring an action against him for slander. As he said this his eyes blazed. He did not content himself with asserting that Bloch and M. Nissim Bernard had no cause for complaint against him, but was soon saying that they might consider themselves lucky that he made no complaint against them. Finally, M. Nissim Bernard having apparently stated that Thibaut played as well as Morel, the last-named decided that he ought to take the matter into court, such a remark being calculated to damage him in his profession, then, as there was no longer any justice in France, especially against the Jews (anti-semitism being in Morel the natural effect of a loan of 5,000 francs from an Israelite), took to never going out without a loaded revolver. A similar nervous reaction, in the wake of keen affection, was soon to occur in Morel with regard to the tailor\u2019s niece. It is true that M. de Charlus may have been unconsciously responsible, to some extent, for this change, for he was in the habit of saying, without meaning what he said for an instant, and merely to tease them, that, once they were married, he would never set eyes on them again but would leave them to fly upon their own wings. This idea was, in itself, quite insufficient to detach Morel from the girl; but, lurking in his mind, it was ready when the time came to combine with other analogous ideas, capable, once the compound was formed, of becoming a powerful disruptive agent\nIt was not very often, however, that I was fated to meet M. de Charlus and Morel. Often they had already passed into Jupien\u2019s shop when I came away from the Duchess, for the pleasure that I found in her society was such that I was led to forget not merely the anxious expectation that preceded Albertine\u2019s return, but even the hour of that return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall set apart from the other days on which I lingered at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, one that was distinguished by a trivial incident the cruel significance of which entirely escaped me and did not enter my mind until long afterwards. On this particular afternoon, Mme. de Guermantes had given me, knowing that I was fond of them, some branches of syringa which had been sent to her from the South. When I left the Duchess and went upstairs to our flat, Albertine had already returned, and on the staircase I ran into Andr\u00e9e who seemed to be distressed by the powerful fragrance of the flowers that I was bringing home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat, are you back already?\u201d I said. \u201cOnly this moment, but Albertine had letters to write, so she sent me away.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019s up to any mischief?\u201d \u201cNot at all, she\u2019s writing to her aunt, I think, but you know how she dislikes strong scents, she won\u2019t be particularly pleased to see those syringas.\u201d \u201cHow stupid of me! I shall tell Fran\u00e7oise to put them out on the service stair.\u201d \u201cDo you imagine Albertine won\u2019t notice the scent of them on you? Next to tuberoses they\u2019ve the strongest scent of any flower, I always think; anyhow, I believe Fran\u00e7oise has gone out shopping.\u201d \u201cBut in that case, as I haven\u2019t got my latchkey, how am I to get in?\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019ve only got to ring the bell. Albertine will let you in. Besides, Fran\u00e7oise may have come back by this time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said good-bye to Andr\u00e9e. I had no sooner pressed the bell than Albertine came to open the door, which required some doing, as Fran\u00e7oise had gone out and Albertine did not know where to turn on the light. At length she was able to let me in, but the scent of the syringas put her to flight. I took them to the kitchen, with the result that my mistress, leaving her letter unfinished (why, I did not understand), had time to go to my room, from which she called to me, and to lay herself down on my bed. Even then, at the actual moment, I saw nothing in all this that was not perfectly natural, at the most a little confused, but in any case unimportant. She had nearly been caught out with Andr\u00e9e and had snatched a brief respite for herself by turning out the lights, going to my room so that I should not see the disordered state of her own bed, and pretending to be busy writing a letter. But we shall see all this later on, a situation the truth of which I never ascertained. In general, and apart from this isolated incident, everything was quite normal when I returned from my visit to the Duchess. Since Albertine never knew whether I might not wish to go out with her before dinner, I usually found in the hall her hat, cloak and umbrella, which she had left lying there in case they should be needed. As soon as, on opening the door, I caught sight of them, the atmosphere of the house became breathable once more. I felt that, instead of a rarefied air, it was happiness that filled it. I was rescued from my melancholy, the sight of these trifles gave me possession of Albertine, I ran to greet her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the days when I did not go down to Mme. de Guermantes, to pass the time somehow, during the hour that preceded the return of my mistress, I would take up an album of Elstir\u2019s work, one of Bergotte\u2019s books, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, just as those works of art which seem to address themselves to the eye or ear alone require that, if we are to enjoy them, our awakened intelligence shall collaborate closely with those organs, I would unconsciously evoke from myself the dreams that Albertine had inspired in me long ago, before I knew her, dreams that had been stifled by the routine of everyday life. I cast them into the composer\u2019s phrase or the painter\u2019s image as into a crucible, or used them to enrich the book that I was reading. And no doubt the book appeared all the more vivid in consequence. But Albertine herself profited just as much by being thus transported out of one of the two worlds to which we have access, and in which we can place alternately the same object, by escaping thus from the crushing weight of matter to play freely in the fluid space of mind. I found myself suddenly and for the instant capable of feeling an ardent desire for this irritating girl. She had at that moment the appearance of a work by Elstir or Bergotte, I felt a momentary enthusiasm for her, seeing her in the perspective of imagination and art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently some one came to tell me that she had returned; though there was a standing order that her name was not to be mentioned if I was not alone, if for instance I had in the room with me Bloch, whom I would compel to remain with me a little longer so that there should be no risk of his meeting my mistress in the hall. For I concealed the fact that she was staying in the house, and even that I ever saw her there, so afraid was I that one of my friends might fall in love with her, and wait for her outside, or that in a momentary encounter in the passage or the hall she might make a signal and fix an appointment. Then I heard the rustle of Albertine\u2019s petticoats on her way to her own room, for out of discretion and also no doubt in that spirit in which, when we used to go to dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, she took care that I should have no cause for jealousy, she did not come to my room, knowing that I was not alone. But it was not only for this reason, as I suddenly realised. I remembered; I had known a different Albertine, then all at once she had changed into another, the Albertine of to-day. And for this change I could hold no one responsible but myself. The admissions that she would have made to me, easily at first, then deliberately, when we were simply friends, had ceased to flow from her as soon as she had suspected that I was in love with her, or, without perhaps naming Love, had divined the existence in me of an inquisitorial sentiment that desires to know, is pained by the knowledge, and seeks to learn yet more. Ever since that day, she had concealed everything from me. She kept away from my room if she thought that my companion was (rarely as this happened) not male but female, she whose eyes used at one time to sparkle so brightly whenever I mentioned a girl: \u201cYou must try and get her to come here. I should like to meet her.\u201d \u201cBut she has what you call a bad style.\u201d \u201cOf course, that makes it all the more fun.\u201d At that moment, I might perhaps have learned all that there was to know. And indeed when in the little Casino she had withdrawn her breast from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s, I believe that this was due not to my presence but to that of Cottard, who was capable, she doubtless thought, of giving her a bad reputation. And yet, even then, she had already begun to \u2018set,\u2019 the confiding speeches no longer issued from her lips, her gestures became reserved. After this, she had stripped herself of everything that could stir my emotions. To those parts of her life of which I knew nothing she ascribed a character the inoffensiveness of which my ignorance made itself her accomplice in accentuating. And now, the transformation was completed, she went straight to her room if I was not alone, not merely from fear of disturbing me, but in order to shew me that she did not care who was with me. There was one thing alone which she would never again do for me, which she would have done only in the days when it would have left me cold, which she would then have done without hesitation for that very reason, namely make me a detailed admission. I should always be obliged, like a judge, to draw indefinite conclusions from imprudences of speech that were perhaps not really inexplicable without postulating criminality. And always she would feel that I was jealous, and judging her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I listened to Albertine\u2019s footsteps with the consoling pleasure of thinking that she would not be going out again that evening, I thought how wonderful it was that for this girl, whom at one time I had supposed that I could never possibly succeed in knowing, the act of returning home every day was nothing else than that of entering my home. The pleasure, a blend of mystery and sensuality, which I had felt, fugitive and fragmentary, at Balbec, on the night when she had come to sleep at the hotel, was completed, stabilised, filled my dwelling, hitherto void, with a permanent store of domestic, almost conjugal bliss (radiating even into the passages) upon which all my senses, either actively, or, when I was alone, in imagination as I waited for her to return, quietly battened. When I had heard the door of Albertine\u2019s room shut behind her, if I had a friend with me, I made haste to get rid of him, not leaving him until I was quite sure that he was on the staircase, down which I might even escort him for a few steps. He warned me that I would catch cold, informing me that our house was indeed icy, a cave of the winds, and that he would not live in it if he was paid to do so. This cold weather was a source of complaint because it had just begun, and people were not yet accustomed to it, but for that very reason it released in me a joy accompanied by an unconscious memory of the first evenings of winter when, in past years, returning from the country, in order to reestablish contact with the forgotten delights of Paris, I used to go to a caf\u00e9-concert. And so it was with a song on my lips that, after bidding my friend good-bye, I climbed the stair again and entered the flat. Summer had flown, carrying the birds with it. But other musicians, invisible, internal, had taken their place. And the icy blast against which Bloch had inveighed, which was whistling delightfully through the ill fitting doors of our apartment was (as the fine days of summer by the woodland birds) passionately greeted with snatches, irrepressibly hummed, from Fragson, Mayol or Paulus. In the passage, Albertine was coming towards me. \u201cI say, while I\u2019m taking off my things, I shall send you Andr\u00e9e, she\u2019s looked in for a minute to say how d\u2019ye do.\u201d And still swathed in the big grey veil, falling from her chinchilla toque, which I had given her at Balbec, she turned from me and went back to her room, as though she had guessed that Andr\u00e9e, whom I had charged with the duty of watching over her, would presently, by relating their day\u2019s adventures in full detail, mentioning their meeting with some person of their acquaintance, impart a certain clarity of outline to the vague regions in which that excursion had been made which had taken the whole day and which I had been incapable of imagining. Andr\u00e9e\u2019s defects had become more evident; she was no longer as pleasant a companion as when I first knew her. One noticed now, on the surface, a sort of bitter uneasiness, ready to gather like a swell on the sea, merely if I happened to mention something that gave pleasure to Albertine and myself. This did not prevent Andr\u00e9e from being kinder to me, liking me better \u2014 and I have had frequent proof of this \u2014 than other more sociable people. But the slightest look of happiness on a person\u2019s face, if it was not caused by herself, gave a shock to her nerves, as unpleasant as that given by a banging door. She could allow the pains in which she had no part, but not the pleasures; if she saw that I was unwell, she was distressed, was sorry for me, would have stayed to nurse me. But if I displayed a satisfaction as trifling as that of stretching myself with a blissful expression as I shut a book, saying: \u201cAh! I have spent a really happy afternoon with this entertaining book,\u201d these words, which would have given pleasure to my mother, to Albertine, to Saint-Loup, provoked in Andr\u00e9e a sort of disapprobation, perhaps simply a sort of nervous irritation. My satisfactions caused her an annoyance which she was unable to conceal. These defects were supplemented by others of a more serious nature; one day when I mentioned that young man so learned in matters of racing and golf, so uneducated in all other respects, Andr\u00e9e said with a sneer: \u201cYou know that his father is a swindler, he only just missed being prosecuted. They\u2019re swaggering now more than ever, but I tell everybody about it. I should love them to bring an action for slander against me. I should be wonderful in the witness-box!\u201d Her eyes sparkled. Well, I discovered that the father had done nothing wrong, and that Andr\u00e9e knew this as well as anybody. But she had thought that the son looked down upon her, had sought for something that would embarrass him, put him to shame, had invented a long story of evidence which she imagined herself called upon to give in court, and, by dint of repeating the details to herself, was perhaps no longer aware that they were not true. And so, in her present state (and even without her fleeting, foolish hatreds), I should not have wished to see her, were it merely on account of that malicious susceptibility which clasped with a harsh and frigid girdle her warmer and better nature. But the information which she alone could give me about my mistress was of too great interest for me to be able to neglect so rare an opportunity of acquiring it. Andr\u00e9e came into my room, shutting the door behind her; they had met a girl they knew, whom Albertine had never mentioned to me. \u201cWhat did they talk about?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you; I took the opportunity, as Albertine wasn\u2019t alone, to go and buy some worsted.\u201d \u201cBuy some worsted?\u201d \u201cYes, it was Albertine asked me to get it.\u201d \u201cAll the more reason not to have gone, it was perhaps a plot to get you out of the way.\u201d \u201cBut she asked me to go for it before we met her friend.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d I replied, drawing breath again. At once my suspicion revived; she might, for all I knew, have made an appointment beforehand with her friend and have provided herself with an excuse to be left alone when the time came. Besides, could I be certain that it was not my former hypothesis (according to which Andr\u00e9e did not always tell me the truth) that was correct? Andr\u00e9e was perhaps in the plot with Albertine. Love, I used to say to myself, at Balbec, is what we feel for a person whose actions seem rather to arouse our jealousy; we feel that if she were to tell us everything, we might perhaps easily be cured of our love for her. However skilfully jealousy is concealed by him who suffers from it, it is at once detected by her who has inspired it, and who when the time comes is no less skilful. She seeks to lead us off the trail of what might make us unhappy, and succeeds, for, to the man who is not forewarned, how should a casual utterance reveal the falsehoods that lie beneath it? We do not distinguish this utterance from the rest; spoken in terror, it is received without attention. Later on, when we are by ourselves, we shall return to this speech, it will seem to us not altogether adequate to the facts of the case. But do we remember it correctly? It seems as though there arose spontaneously in us, with regard to it and to the accuracy of our memory, an uncertainty of the sort with which, in certain nervous disorders, we can never remember whether we have bolted the door, no better after the fiftieth time than after the first, it would seem that we can repeat the action indefinitely without its ever being accompanied by a precise and liberating memory. At any rate, we can shut the door again, for the fifty-first time. Whereas the disturbing speech exists in the past in an imperfect hearing of it which it does not lie in our power to repeat. Then we concentrate our attention upon other speeches which conceal nothing and the sole remedy which we do not seek is to be ignorant of everything, so as to have no desire for further knowledge\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as jealousy is discovered, it is regarded by her who is its object as a challenge which authorises deception. Moreover, in our endeavour to learn something, it is we who have taken the initiative in lying and deceit. Andr\u00e9e, Aim\u00e9 may promise us that they will say nothing, but will they keep their promise? Bloch could promise nothing because he knew nothing, and Albertine has only to talk to any of the three in order to learn, with the help of what Saint-Loup would have called cross-references, that we are lying to her when we pretend to be indifferent to her actions and morally incapable of having her watched. And so, replacing in this way my habitual boundless uncertainty as to what Albertine might be doing, an uncertainty too indeterminate not to remain painless, which was to jealousy what is to grief that beginning of forgetfulness in which relief is born of vagueness, the little fragment of response which Andr\u00e9e had brought me at once began to raise fresh questions; the only result of my exploration of one sector of the great zone that extended round me had been to banish further from me that unknowable thing which, when we seek to form a definite idea of it, another person\u2019s life invariably is to us. I continued to question Andr\u00e9e, while Albertine, from discretion and in order to leave me free (was she conscious of this?) to question the other, prolonged her toilet in her own room. \u201cI think that Albertine\u2019s uncle and aunt both like me,\u201d I stupidly said to Andr\u00e9e, forgetting her peculiar nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At once I saw her gelatinous features change. Like a syrup that has turned, her face seemed permanently clouded. Her mouth became bitter. Nothing remained in Andr\u00e9e of that juvenile gaiety which, like all the little band and notwithstanding her feeble health, she had displayed in the year of my first visit to Balbec and which now (it is true that Andr\u00e9e was now several years older) was so speedily eclipsed in her. But I was to make it reappear involuntarily before Andr\u00e9e left me that evening to go home to dinner. \u201cSomebody was singing your praises to me to-day in the most glowing language,\u201d I said to her. Immediately a ray of joy beamed from her eyes, she looked as though she really loved me. She avoided my gaze but smiled at the empty air with a pair of eyes that suddenly became quite round. \u201cWho was it?\u201d she asked, with an artless, avid interest. I told her, and, whoever it was, she was delighted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then the time came for us to part, and she left me. Albertine came to my room; she had undressed, and was wearing one of the charming cr\u00eape de chine wrappers, or one of the Japanese gowns which I had asked Mme. de Guermantes to describe to me, and for some of which supplementary details had been furnished me by Mme. Swann, in a letter that began: \u201cAfter your long eclipse, I felt as I read your letter about my tea-gowns that I was receiving a message from the other world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had on her feet a pair of black shoes studded with brilliants which Fran\u00e7oise indignantly called \u2018pattens,\u2019 modelled upon the shoes which, from the drawing-room window, she had seen Mme. de Guermantes wearing in the evening, just as a little later Albertine took to wearing slippers, some of gilded kid, others of chinchilla, the sight of which was pleasant to me because they were all of them signs (which other shoes would not have been) that she was living under my roof. She had also certain things which had not come to her from me, including a fine gold ring. I admired upon it the outspread wings of an eagle. \u201cIt was my aunt gave me it,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe can be quite nice sometimes after all. It makes me feel terribly old, because she gave it to me on my twentieth birthday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine took a far keener interest in all these pretty things than the Duchess, because, like every obstacle in the way of possession (in my own case the ill health which made travel so difficult and so desirable), poverty, more generous than opulence, gives to women what is better than the garments that they cannot afford to buy, the desire for those garments which is the genuine, detailed, profound knowledge of them. She, because she had never been able to afford these things, I, because in ordering them for her I was seeking to give her pleasure, we were both of us like students who already know all about the pictures which they are longing to go to Dresden or Vienna to see. Whereas rich women, amid the multitude of their hats and gowns, are like those tourists to whom the visit to a gallery, being preceded by no desire, gives merely a sensation of bewilderment, boredom and exhaustion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A particular toque, a particular sable cloak, a particular Doucet wrapper, its sleeves lined with pink, assumed for Albertine, who had observed them, coveted them and, thanks to the exclusiveness and minute nicety that are elements of desire, had at once isolated them from everything else in a void against which the lining or the scarf stood out to perfection, and learned them by heart in every detail \u2014 and for myself who had gone to Mme. de Guermantes in quest of an explanation of what constituted the peculiar merit, the superiority, the smartness of the garment and the inimitable style of the great designer \u2014 an importance, a charm which they certainly did not possess for the Duchess, surfeited before she had even acquired an appetite and would not, indeed, have possessed for myself had I beheld them a few years earlier while accompanying some lady of fashion on one of her wearisome tours of the dressmakers\u2019 shops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, a lady of fashion was what Albertine was gradually becoming. For, even if each of the things that I ordered for her was the prettiest of its kind, with all the refinements that had been added to it by Mme. de Guermantes or Mme. Swann, she was beginning to possess these things in abundance. But no matter, so long as she admired them from the first, and each of them separately\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we have been smitten by one painter, then by another, we may end by feeling for the whole gallery an admiration that is not frigid, for it is made up of successive enthusiasms, each one exclusive in its day, which finally have joined forces and become reconciled in one whole\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not, for that matter, frivolous, read a great deal when she was by herself, and used to read aloud when she was with me. She had become extremely intelligent. She would say, though she was quite wrong in saying: \u201cI am appalled when I think that but for you I should still be quite ignorant. Don\u2019t contradict. You have opened up a world of ideas to me which I never suspected, and whatever I may have become I owe entirely to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will be remembered that she had spoken in similar terms of my influence over Andr\u00e9e. Had either of them a sentimental regard for me? And, in themselves, what were Albertine and Andr\u00e9e? To learn the answer, I should have to immobilise you, to cease to live in that perpetual expectation, ending always in a different presentment of you, I should have to cease to love you, in order to fix you, to cease to know your interminable and ever disconcerting arrival, oh girls, oh recurrent ray in the swirl wherein we throb with emotion upon seeing you reappear while barely recognising you, in the dizzy velocity of light. That velocity, we should perhaps remain unaware of it and everything would seem to us motionless, did not a sexual attraction set us in pursuit of you, drops of gold always different, and always passing our expectation! On each occasion a girl so little resembles what she was the time before (shattering in fragments as soon as we catch sight of her the memory that we had retained of her and the desire that we were proposing to gratify), that the stability of nature which we ascribe to her is purely fictitious and a convenience of speech. We have been told that some pretty girl is tender, loving, full of the most delicate sentiments. Our imagination accepts this assurance, and when we behold for the first time, within the woven girdle of her golden hair, the rosy disc of her face, we are almost afraid that this too virtuous sister may chill our ardour by her very virtue, that she can never be to us the lover for whom we have been longing. What secrets, at least, we confide in her from the first moment, on the strength of that nobility of heart, what plans we discuss together. But a few days later, we regret that we were so confiding, for the rose-leaf girl, at our second meeting, addresses us in the language of a lascivious Fury. As for the successive portraits which after a pulsation lasting for some days the renewal of the rosy light presents to us, it is not even certain that a momentum external to these girls has not modified their aspect, and this might well have happened with my band of girls at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People extol to us the gentleness, the purity of a virgin. But afterwards they feel that something more seasoned would please us better, and recommend her to shew more boldness. In herself was she one more than the other? Perhaps not, but capable of yielding to any number of different possibilities in the headlong current of life. With another girl, whose whole attraction lay in something implacable (which we counted upon subduing to our own will), as, for instance, with the terrible jumping girl at Balbec who grazed in her spring the bald pates of startled old gentlemen, what a disappointment when, in the fresh aspect of her, just as we were addressing her in affectionate speeches stimulated by our memory of all her cruelty to other people, we heard her, as her first move in the game, tell us that she was shy, that she could never say anything intelligent to anyone at a first introduction, so frightened was she, and that it was only after a fortnight or so that she would be able to talk to us at her ease. The steel had turned to cotton, there was nothing left for us to attempt to break, since she herself had lost all her consistency. Of her own accord, but by our fault perhaps, for the tender words which we had addressed to Severity had perhaps, even without any deliberate calculation on her part, suggested to her that she ought to be gentle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distressing as the change may have been to us, it was not altogether maladroit, for our gratitude for all her gentleness would exact more from us perhaps than our delight at overcoming her cruelty. I do not say that a day will not come when, even to these luminous maidens, we shall not assign sharply differentiated characters, but that will be because they have ceased to interest us, because their entry upon the scene will no longer be to our heart the apparition which it expected in a different form and which leaves it overwhelmed every time by fresh incarnations. Their immobility will spring from our indifference to them, which will hand them over to the judgment of our mind. This will not, for that matter, be expressed in any more categorical terms, for after it has decided that some defect which was prominent in one is fortunately absent from the other, it will see that this defect had as its counterpart some priceless merit. So that the false judgment of our intellect, which comes into play only when we have ceased to take any interest, will define permanent characters of girls, which will enlighten us no more than the surprising faces that used to appear every day when, in the dizzy speed of our expectation, our friends presented themselves daily, weekly, too different to allow us, as they never halted in their passage, to classify them, to award degrees of merit. As for our sentiments, we have spoken of them too often to repeat again now that as often as not love is nothing more than the association of the face of a girl (whom otherwise we should soon have found intolerable) with the heartbeats inseparable from an endless, vain expectation, and from some trick that she has played upon us. All this is true not merely of imaginative young men brought into contact with changeable girls. At the stage that our narrative has now reached, it appears, as I have since heard, that Jupien\u2019s niece had altered her opinion of Morel and M. de Charlus. My motorist, reinforcing the love that she felt for Morel, had extolled to her, as existing in the violinist, boundless refinements of delicacy in which she was all too ready to believe. And at the same time Morel never ceased to complain to her of the despotic treatment that he received from M. de Charlus, which she ascribed to malevolence, never imagining that it could be due to love. She was moreover bound to acknowledge that M. de Charlus was tyrannically present at all their meetings. In corroboration of all this, she had heard women in society speak of the Baron\u2019s terrible spite. Now, quite recently, her judgment had been completely reversed. She had discovered in Morel (without ceasing for that reason to love him) depths of malevolence and perfidy, compensated it was true by frequent kindness and genuine feeling, and in M. de Charlus an unimaginable and immense generosity blended with asperities of which she knew nothing. And so she had been unable to arrive at any more definite judgment of what, each in himself, the violinist and his protector really were, than I was able to form of Andr\u00e9e, whom nevertheless I saw every day, or of Albertine who was living with me. On the evenings when the latter did not read aloud to me, she would play to me or begin a game of draughts, or a conversation, either of which I would interrupt with kisses. The simplicity of our relations made them soothing. The very emptiness of her life gave Albertine a sort of eagerness to comply with the only requests that I made of her. Behind this girl, as behind the purple light that used to filter beneath the curtains of my room at Balbec, while outside the concert blared, were shining the blue-green undulations of the sea. Was she not, after all (she in whose heart of hearts there was now regularly installed an idea of myself so familiar that, next to her aunt, I was perhaps the person whom she distinguished least from herself), the girl whom I had seen the first time at Balbec, in her flat polo-cap, with her insistent laughing eyes, a stranger still, exiguous as a silhouette projected against the waves? These effigies preserved intact in our memory, when we recapture them, we are astonished at their unlikeness to the person whom we know, and we begin to realise what a task of remodelling is performed every day by habit. In the charm that Albertine had in Paris, by my fireside, there still survived the desire that had been aroused in me by that insolent and blossoming parade along the beach, and just as Rachel retained in Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, even after he had made her abandon it, the prestige of her life on the stage, so in this Albertine cloistered in my house, far from Balbec, from which I had hurried her away, there persisted the emotion, the social confusion, the uneasy vanity, the roving desires of life by the seaside. She was so effectively caged that on certain evenings I did not even ask her to leave her room for mine, her to whom at one time all the world gave chase, whom I had found it so hard to overtake as she sped past on her bicycle, whom the lift-boy himself was unable to capture for me, leaving me with scarcely a hope of her coming, although I sat up waiting for her all the night. Had not Albertine been \u2014 out there in front of the Hotel \u2014 like a great actress of the blazing beach, arousing jealousy when she advanced upon that natural stage, not speaking to anyone, thrusting past its regular frequenters, dominating the girls, her friends, and was not this so greatly coveted actress the same who, withdrawn by me from the stage, shut up in my house, was out of reach now of the desires of all the rest, who might hereafter seek for her in vain, sitting now in my room, now in her own, and engaged in tracing or cutting out some pattern?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in the first days at Balbec, Albertine seemed to be on a parallel plane to that upon which I was living, but one that had drawn closer (after my visit to Elstir) and had finally become merged in it, as my relations with her, at Balbec, in Paris, then at Balbec again, grew more intimate. Besides, between the two pictures of Balbec, at my first visit and at my second, pictures composed of the same villas from which the same girls walked down to the same sea, what a difference! In Albertine\u2019s friends at the time of my second visit, whom I knew so well, whose good and bad qualities were so clearly engraved on their features, how was I to recapture those fresh, mysterious strangers who at first could not, without making my heart throb, thrust open the door of their bungalow over the grinding sand and set the tamarisks shivering as they came down the path! Their huge eyes had, in the interval, been absorbed into their faces, doubtless because they had ceased to be children, but also because those ravishing strangers, those ravishing actresses of the romantic first year, as to whom I had gone ceaselessly in quest of information, no longer held any mystery for me. They had become obedient to my caprices, a mere grove of budding girls, from among whom I was quite distinctly proud of having plucked, and carried off from them all, their fairest rose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the two Balbec scenes, so different one from the other, there was the interval of several years in Paris, the long expanse of which was dotted with all the visits that Albertine had paid me. I saw her in successive years of my life occupying, with regard to myself, different positions, which made me feel the beauty of the interposed gaps, that long extent of time in which I never set eyes on her and against the diaphanous background of which the rosy person that I saw before me was modelled with mysterious shadows and in bold relief. This was due also to the superimposition not merely of the successive images which Albertine had been for me, but also of the great qualities of brain and heart, the defects of character, all alike unsuspected by me, which Albertine, in a germination, a multiplication of herself, a carnal efflorescence in sombre colours, had added to a nature that formerly could scarcely have been said to exist, but was now deep beyond plumbing. For other people, even those of whom we have so often dreamed that they have become nothing more than a picture, a figure by Benozzo Gozzoli standing out upon a background of verdure, as to whom we were prepared to believe that the only variations depended upon the point of view from which we looked at them, their distance from us, the effect of light and shade, these people, while they change in relation to ourselves, change also in themselves, and there had been an enrichment, a solidification and an increase of volume in the figure once so simply outlined against the sea. Moreover, it was not only the sea at the close of day that came to life for me in Albertine, but sometimes the drowsy murmur of the sea upon the shore on moonlit nights\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, indeed, when I rose to fetch a book from my father\u2019s study, and had given my mistress permission to lie down while I was out of the room, she was so tired after her long outing in the morning and afternoon in the open air that, even if I had been away for a moment only, when I returned I found Albertine asleep and did not rouse her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretched out at full length upon my bed, in an attitude so natural that no art could have designed it, she reminded me of a long blossoming stem that had been laid there, and so indeed she was: the faculty of dreaming which I possessed only in her absence I recovered at such moments in her presence, as though by falling asleep she had become a plant. In this way her sleep did to a certain extent make love possible. When she was present, I spoke to her, but I was too far absent from myself to be able to think. When she was asleep, I no longer needed to talk to her, I knew that she was no longer looking at me, I had no longer any need to live upon my own outer surface\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By shutting her eyes, by losing consciousness, Albertine had stripped off, one after another, the different human characters with which she had deceived me ever since the day when I had first made her acquaintance. She was animated now only by the unconscious life of vegetation, of trees, a life more different from my own, more alien, and yet one that belonged more to me. Her personality did not escape at every moment, as when we were talking, by the channels of her unacknowledged thoughts and of her gaze. She had called back into herself everything of her that lay outside, had taken refuge, enclosed, reabsorbed, in her body. In keeping her before my eyes, in my hands, I had that impression of possessing her altogether, which I never had when she was awake. Her life was submitted to me, exhaled towards me its gentle breath\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I listened to this murmuring, mysterious emanation, soft as a breeze from the sea, fairylike as that moonlight which was her sleep. So long as it lasted, I was free to think about her and at the same time to look at her, and, when her sleep grew deeper, to touch, to kiss her. What I felt then was love in the presence of something as pure, as immaterial in its feelings, as mysterious, as if I had been in the presence of those inanimate creatures which are the beauties of nature. And indeed, as soon as her sleep became at all heavy, she ceased to be merely the plant that she had been; her sleep, on the margin of which I remained musing, with a fresh delight of which I never tired, but could have gone on enjoying indefinitely, was to me an undiscovered country. Her sleep brought within my reach something as calm, as sensually delicious as those nights of full moon on the bay of Balbec, turned quiet as a lake over which the branches barely stir, where stretched out upon the sand one could listen for hours on end to the waves breaking and receding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I entered the room, I remained standing in the doorway, not venturing to make a sound, and hearing none but that of her breath rising to expire upon her lips at regular intervals, like the reflux of the sea, but drowsier and more gentle. And at the moment when my ear absorbed that divine sound, I felt that there was, condensed in it, the whole person, the whole life of the charming captive, outstretched there before my eyes. Carriages went rattling past in the street, her features remained as motionless, as pure, her breath as light, reduced to the simplest expulsion of the necessary quantity of air. Then, seeing that her sleep would not be disturbed, I advanced cautiously, sat down upon the chair that stood by the bedside, then upon the bed itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have spent charming evenings talking, playing games with Albertine. but never any so pleasant as when I was watching her sleep. Granted that she might have, as she chatted with me, or played cards, that spontaneity which no actress could have imitated, it was a spontaneity carried to the second degree that was offered me by her sleep. Her hair, falling all along her rosy face, was spread out beside her on the bed, and here and there a separate straight tress gave the same effect of perspective as those moonlit trees, lank and pale, which one sees standing erect and stiff in the backgrounds of Elstir\u2019s Raphaelesque pictures. If Albertine\u2019s lips were closed, her eyelids, on the other hand, seen from the point at which I was standing, seemed so loosely joined that I might almost have questioned whether she really was asleep. At the same time those drooping lids introduced into her face that perfect continuity, unbroken by any intrusion of eyes. There are people whose faces assume a quite unusual beauty and majesty the moment they cease to look out of their eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I measured with my own Albertine outstretched at my feet. Now and then a slight, unaccountable tremor ran through her body, as the leaves of a tree are shaken for a few moments by a sudden breath of wind. She would touch her hair, then, not having arranged it to her liking, would raise her hand to it again with motions so consecutive, so deliberate, that I was convinced that she was about to wake. Not at all, she grew calm again in the sleep from which she had not emerged. After this she lay without moving. She had laid her hand on her bosom with a sinking of the arm so artlessly childlike that I was obliged, as I gazed at her, to suppress the smile that is provoked in us by the solemnity, the innocence and the charm of little children\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I, who was acquainted with many Albertines in one person, seemed now to see many more again, reposing by my side. Her eyebrows, arched as I had never seen them, enclosed the globes of her eyelids like a halcyon\u2019s downy nest. Races, atavisms, vices reposed upon her face. Whenever she moved her head, she created a fresh woman, often one whose existence I had never suspected. I seemed to possess not one, but innumerable girls. Her breathing, as it became gradually deeper, was now regularly stirring her bosom and, through it, her folded hands, her pearls, displaced in a different way by the same movement, like the boats, the anchor chains that are set swaying by the movement of the tide. Then, feeling that the tide of her sleep was full, that I should not ground upon reefs of consciousness covered now by the high water of profound slumber, deliberately, I crept without a sound upon the bed, lay down by her side, clasped her waist in one arm, placed my lips upon her cheek and heart, then upon every part of her body in turn laid my free hand, which also was raised, like the pearls, by Albertine\u2019s breathing; I myself was gently rocked by its regular motion: I had embarked upon the tide of Albertine\u2019s sleep. Sometimes it made me taste a pleasure that was less pure. For this I had no need to make any movement, I allowed my leg to dangle against hers, like an oar which one allows to trail in the water, imparting to it now and again a gentle oscillation like the intermittent flap given to its wing by a bird asleep in the air. I chose, in gazing at her, this aspect of her face which no one ever saw and which was so pleasing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is I suppose comprehensible that the letters which we receive from a person are more or less similar and combine to trace an image of the writer so different from the person whom we know as to constitute a second personality. But how much stranger is it that a woman should be conjoined, like Rosita and Doodica, with another woman whose different beauty makes us infer another character, and that in order to behold one we must look at her in profile, the other in full face. The sound of her breathing as it grew louder might give the illusion of the breathless ecstasy of pleasure and, when mine was at its climax, I could kiss her without having interrupted her sleep. I felt at such moments that I had been possessing her more completely, like an unconscious and unresisting object of dumb nature. I was not affected by the words that she muttered occasionally in her sleep, their meaning escaped me, and besides, whoever the unknown person to whom they referred, it was upon my hand, upon my cheek that her hand, as an occasional tremor recalled it to life, stiffened for an instant. I relished her sleep with a disinterested, soothing love, just as I would remain for hours listening to the unfurling of the waves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it is laid down that people must be capable of making us suffer intensely before, in the hours of respite, they can procure for us the same soothing calm as Nature. I had not to answer her as when we were engaged in conversation, and even if I could have remained silent, as for that matter I did when it was she that was talking, still while listening to her voice I did not penetrate so far into herself. As I continued to hear, to gather from moment to moment the murmur, soothing as a barely perceptible breeze, of her breath, it was a whole physiological existence that was spread out before me, for me; as I used to remain for hours lying on the beach, in the moonlight, so long could I have remained there gazing at her, listening to her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one would have said that the sea was becoming rough, that the storm was making itself felt even inside the bay, and like the bay I lay listening to the gathering roar of her breath. Sometimes, when she was too warm, she would take off, already half asleep, her kimono which she flung over my armchair. While she was asleep I would tell myself that all her correspondence was in the inner pocket of this kimono, into which she always thrust her letters. A signature, a written appointment would have sufficed to prove a lie or to dispel a suspicion. When I could see that Albertine was sound asleep, leaving the foot of the bed where I had been standing motionless in contemplation of her, I took a step forward, seized by a burning curiosity, feeling that the secret of this other life lay offering itself to me, flaccid and defenceless, in that armchair. Perhaps I took this step forward also because to stand perfectly still and watch her sleeping became tiring after a while. And so, on tiptoe, constantly turning round to make sure that Albertine was not waking, I made my way to the armchair. There I stopped short, stood for a long time gazing at the kimono, as I had stood for a long time gazing at Albertine. But (and here perhaps I was wrong) never once did I touch the kimono, put my hand in the pocket, examine the letters. In the end, realising that I would never make up my mind, I started back, on tiptoe, returned to Albertine\u2019s bedside and began again to watch her sleeping, her who would tell me nothing, whereas I could see lying across an arm of the chair that kimono which would have told me much. And just as people pay a hundred francs a day for a room at the Hotel at Balbec in order to breathe the sea air, I felt it to be quite natural that I should spend more than that upon her since I had her breath upon my cheek, between her lips which I parted with my own, through which her life flowed against my tongue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this pleasure of seeing her sleep, which was as precious as that of feeling her live, was cut short by another pleasure, that of seeing her wake. It was, carried to a more profound and more mysterious degree, the same pleasure that I felt in having her under my roof. It was gratifying, of course, in the afternoon, when she alighted from the carriage, that it should be to my address that she was returning. It was even more so to me that when from the underworld of sleep she climbed the last steps of the stair of dreams, it was in my room that she was reborn to consciousness and life, that she asked herself for an instant: \u201cWhere am I?\u201d and, seeing all the things in the room round about her, the lamp whose light scarcely made her blink her eyes, was able to assure herself that she was at home, as soon as she realised that she was waking in my home. In that first delicious moment of uncertainty, it seemed to me that once again I took a more complete possession of her since, whereas after an outing it was to her own room that she returned, it was now my room that, as soon as Albertine should have recognised it, was about to enclose, to contain her, without any sign of misgiving in the eyes of my mistress, which remained as calm as if she had never slept at all\nThe uncertainty of awakening revealed by her silence was not at all revealed in her eyes. As soon as she was able to speak she said: \u201cMy \u2014\u2014-\u201d or \u201cMy dearest \u2014\u2014\u201d followed by my Christian name, which, if we give the narrator the same name as the author of this book, would be \u2018My Marcel,\u2019 or \u2018My dearest Marcel.\u2019 After this I would never allow my relatives, by calling me \u2018dearest,\u2019 to rob of their priceless uniqueness the delicious words that Albertine uttered to me. As she uttered them, she pursed her lips in a little pout which she herself transformed into a kiss. As quickly as, earlier in the evening, she had fallen asleep, so quickly had she awoken. No more than my own progression in time, no more than the act of gazing at a. girl seated opposite to me beneath the lamp, which shed upon her a different light from that of the sun when I used to behold her striding along the seashore, was this material enrichment, this autonomous progress of Albertine the determining cause of the difference between my present view of her and my original impression of her at Balbec. A longer term of years might have separated the two images without effecting so complete a change; it had come to pass, essential and sudden, when I learned that my mistress had been virtually brought up by Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend. If at one time I had been carried away by excitement when I thought that I saw a trace of mystery in Albertine\u2019s eyes, now I was happy only at the moments when from those eyes, from her cheeks even, as mirroring as her eyes, so gentle now but quickly turning sullen, I succeeded in expelling every trace of mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The image for which I sought, upon which I reposed, against which I would have liked to lean and die, was no longer that of Albertine leading a hidden life, it was that of an Albertine as familiar to me as possible (and for this reason my love could not be lasting unless it was unhappy, for in its nature it did not satisfy my need of mystery), an Albertine who did not reflect a distant world, but desired nothing else \u2014 there were moments when this did indeed appear to be the case \u2014 than to be with me, a person like myself, an Albertine the embodiment of what belonged to me and not of the unknown. When it is in this way, from an hour of anguish caused by another person, when it is from uncertainty whether we shall be able to keep her or she will escape, that love is born, such love bears the mark of the revolution that has created it, it recalls very little of what we had previously seen when we thought of the person in question. And my first impressions at the sight of Albertine, against a background of sea, might to some small extent persist in my love of her: actually, these earlier impressions occupy but a tiny place in a love of this sort; in its strength, in its agony, in its need of comfort and its return to a calm and soothing memory with which we would prefer to abide and to learn nothing more of her whom we love, even if there be something horrible that we ought to know \u2014 would prefer still more to consult only these earlier memories \u2014 such a love is composed of very different material!", "http://genius.com/Marcel-proust-life-with-albertinechap-11-annotated"], "91075": ["Satyricon (Part Two) by\u00a0Gaius\u00a0Petronius", "Satyricon (Part Two) Lyrics\n\nNot a star appear'd to direct us in our way, nor would the dead of the\nNight give us hopes of meeting a stranger that could; with these, the\nWine we had drank, and our ignorance of the place, even in the day\nTime, conspir'd to mis-direct us.

Tutius dein secutus consilium Gitona quidem\nVerberibus excitavi, and looking as sternly as I cou'd upon Ascyltos\nThus address'd my self: \"Since you've play'd the villain by your\nTreachery, and breaking the common laws of friendship, pack up your\nMatters quickly, and find another comrade to abuse.\"\n\nAscyltos consented; and, after we had made an exact division of our\nBooty; \"Now,\" says he, \"let's share the boy too\": I believ'd it a jest\nAt parting, but, he with a murderous resolution, drew his sword; \"nor\nShall you,\" added he, \"think to ingross this prize, which should, like\nThe rest, be common to us both. I must have my share, or with this\nSword will be content to take it.\" Upon which, on the other side\nHaving twisted my gown under my arm, I made advances to ingage\n\nThe unhappy boy rush'd between, and kissing both our knees, with\nTears, entreated that we would not expose our selves in a pitiful\nAlehouse, nor with our blood pollute the rites of so dear a\nFriendship: but, raising his voice, says he, \"if there must be murder\nBehold my naked bosom, hither direct your fury: 'Tis I deserve death\nWho violated the sacred laws of friendship.\"\n\nUpon which we sheath'd our swords; and first Ascyltos, \"I'll,\" says\nHe, \"end the difference: Let the boy himself follow the man he likes\nThat, in chusing a friend, at least, he may have an unquestion'd\nLiberty.\"\n\nI, that presum'd so long an acquaintance, had made no slight\nImpressions on his nature, was so far from fearing, that with an eager\nHaste I accepted the proffer, and to the judge committed the dispute:\nGito, that he might not seem to consider, at my consent jump'd up, and\nChose Ascyltos\n\nI, like one thunderstruck, at the sentence, void of defence, fell upon\nThe bed, and had not surviv'd the loss, if envy of my rival had not\nStopp'd my sword\n\nAscyltos, proud of the conquest, goes off with the prize, leaving me\nExpos'd in a strange place, that before he caress'd as a friend and\nSharer of his fortune:\n\n'Tis in the world, as in a game of chess;\nWe serve our friends but where our profit is\nWhen fortune smiles, we're yours, and yours alone;\nBut when she frowns, the servile herd are gone\nSo, in a play, they act with mimick art\nFather, or son, or griping miser's part:\nBut when at last the comic scenes are o'er\nThey quit the visards they assum'd before\n\nNor did I there very long complain, for fearing one Menelaus, an usher\nOf a school, might, among other misfortunes, find me alone in the inn\nI made up my wallet, and, very pensive, took me a lodging in a private\nPlace near the sea: there, after I had been mewd up for three days\nReflecting afresh on my despis'd and abject condition, I beat my\nBreast, as sick as it was; and, when my deep sighs would suffer me\nOften cry'd out; \"Why has not the earth burst open, and swallow'd me?\nWhy has not the sea o'erwhelm'd me that respects not even the innocent\nThemselves? Have I been a murderer? when I had violated Lycas's wife\nHave I fled justice? have I escap'd even when I was condemn'd to dye\nTo live in a strange place, to have my name recorded only among\nBeggars and vagabonds? and who condemn'd me to this solitude?--A boy!\nOne who is a prostitute to all manner of lust; and by his own\nConfession deserves to dye; whom vice has enobl'd from a slave; who\nWas publickly contracted with as a girl, by one that knew he was of\nThe other sex: and what a wretch is that other, ye gods! whom, when he\nMight have writ man, his mother perswaded even out of his sex, and\nPutting on petty-coats, was condemn'd to a maids office in a prison:\nWho, after he had spent what he had, and chang'd the scene of his\nLust; having contracted an old friendship, basely left it; and\nFrontless impudence! like a hot whore, for one night's pleasure, sold\nHis friend. Now the lovers lye whole nights lockt in each other's\nArms, and who knows but in those intervals they recruit their weary'd\nStrength, may laugh at me: but they shan't go off so, for if I'm a\nMan, or a free-born one at least, I'll make their blood compensate the\nInjury.\"\n\nHaving thus said I girt on my sword; and lest I shou'd be too weak to\nMaintain the war, encourag'd my self with a lusty meal, and making out\nOf doors, like one possesst, search'd every place: but whilst, with a\nWild distracted countenance, I thought of nothing but blood and\nSlaughter; and oft with execrations laying my hand on my sword, a\nSouldier, perhaps some cheat or padder, observ'd me, and making up to\nMe, askt to what regiment or company I, his brother souldier\nBelong'd? when, with a good assurance, I had cheated him into a belief\nOf the regiment and company; well, but friend, said he, looking down\nDoe the souldiers of your company walk in such shoes? I began to look\nGuilty, and by my trembling discover'd the lye I had told him: upon\nWhich he made me lay down my arms, and bid me take care of the worst\nThus stript, nay and thus rob'd of my revenge, I return'd to my\nLodging, where by degrees my fears abating, I began in my mind to\nThank the robber\n\nBut finding it difficult to wean my self from the love of revenge, I\nSpent half the night very pensively; and rising by day-break, to ease\nMe of my grief, and thoughts of my injury, I rov'd about every where\nTill at last going in to a publick gallery, very wonderful for several\nSorts of excellent painting; I saw some by Zeuxy's hand, that had not\nYet yielded to the injuries of time: And, not without an awful\nReverence, behold others by Protogenes, which tho' they were first\nTryals, yet disputed for exactness, even with nature it self: but on\nThe other side viewing a celebrated piece drawn by Apelles; I even\nAdor'd the work of so great a master: 'twas so correctly finisht to\nThe life, you'd have sworn it an image of the soul too. One side gave\nThe story of the eagle bearing Jupiter to heaven, the other the fair\nHylas repelling the addresses of the lew'd naiad: in another part was\nApollo, angry at himself for killing his boy Hyacinth; and, to shew\nHis love, crown'd his harp with the flower that sprung from his blood\n\nIn this gallery, as in a vision of living images, I cry'd out; and are\nNot the gods themselves secure from love? Jupiter in his seraglio\nAbove, not finding one that can please his appetite, sins upon earth\nYet injures nobody: the nymph wou'd have stifl'd her passion for\nHylas, had she believ'd the lusty Hercules wou'd have been his rival:\nApollo turns Hyacinth into a flower: and every image enjoy'd its\nWishes without a rival: but I have caress'd, as the dearest friend\nThe greatest villain\n\nWhile I was thus talking to my self, there enter'd the gallery an old\nMan, with a face as pale as age had made his hair; and seem'd, I know\nNot how, to bring with him the air of a great soul; but viewing his\nHabit, I was easily confirm'd in my opinion, since fortune seldom\nDeals favourably with learned men. In short, he made up to me, and\nAddressing himself, told me he was a poet; and, as he hop'd, above the\nCommon herd: if, added he, my merrit don't suffer by applause that's\nPromiscuously given, to the good and bad\n\nWhy, therefore, interrupted I, are you so meanly clad? On this\nAccount return'd he, because learning never made any man rich\n\nThe merchant's profit well rewards his toil:\nThe souldier crowns his labours with the spoil:\nTo servile flattery we altars raise:\nAnd the kind wife her stallion ever pays:\nBut starving wit in rags takes barren pain:\nAnd, dying, seeks the muses aid in vain\n\n\"'Tis certain,\" added he, \"that a lover of virtue, on account of his\nSingularity, meets with contempt; for who can approve what differs\nFrom himself? And that those who admire riches, wou'd fain possess\nEvery body, that nothing is more reasonable than their opinion; whence\nThey ridicule, as well as they can, the learned few; that they, like\nThemselves, might seem within the power of money.\"\n\n\"I don't know, how learning and poverty became relations,\" said I, and\nSigh'd: \"You justly lament,\" return'd he, \"the condition of scholars.\"\n\n\"You mistake me,\" said I, \"that's not the occasion of my sighs\nThere's another and much greater cause:\" And, as all men are naturally\nInclin'd to communicate their grief; I laid open my case to him\nBeginning with Ascyltos's treachery, which I aggravated; and, with\nRepeated sighs, often wisht his injustice to me might have deserv'd\nPardon: but that now he was a staunch villain, and in lust more subtle\nThan the bawds themselves\n\nThe old man, seeing me sincere, began to comfort me; and the better to\nEffect it, told me what formerly had happen'd to himself on the like\nOccasion\n\n\"In Asiam cum a quaestore essem stipendio eductus, hospitium Pergami\nAccepi.

'Twas in those times Democritus, content with poverty, found out\nThe vertue of most herbs; and lest there might be any hidden\nExcellence in stones and trees, spent the rest of his life in\nExperiments about them: 'Twas then Eudoxus abandon'd the world, to\nLive on the top of a high mountain, to discover the motions of the\nHeavens and Crisippus, the better to qualify his mind for invention\nWent thrice through a course of physick\n\n\"But to return to imagery, Lysippus with that diligence imploy'd\nHimself about one statue, that, neglecting his living, he dyed, for\nWant: and Myron, whose brazen images of men and beasts, you might have\nMistaken for living ones, dy'd very poor: but our age is so wholly\nDevoted to drinking and whoring, we're so far from inventing, that we\nDon't acquaint our selves even with those arts that are found to our\nHands: But, accusing antiquity, our schools become seminaries of vice\nOnly: what's our logick? How little do we know of astronomy? Where's\nOur philosopher? What master of eloquence could indure to hear it so\nMurdred in a pulpit? What wise man cou'd suffer the noise? Our\nBusiness in the temple is not to inform our minds, or correct our\nLives; but as soon as we enter the place, one out of love to his\nFriend, being made his heir, promises a sacrifice to the gods, if\nThey'd please to take him out of this troublesome world; another, if\nThey'd direct him to a treasure: the like a third promises if they'd\nMake him happy in a small estate of 300l. per an. or so: The very\nSenate that shou'd show an exemplary conduct, in occasions of doubtful\nEvents, have devoted mighty sums of gold to religious uses: And who\nWou'd not but admire, that, he is perswaded hath charms enough to make\nThe gods themselves comply! You need not wonder why painting is lost\nWhen gold appears more beautiful both to gods and men, than any thing\nApelles or Phidias are now esteem'd madly to have spent their time\nAbout: But seeing your curiosity is wholly taken up with that piece\nThat shews you a contracted history of the Siege of Troy: I'll try to\nGive you the story more at large in verse\n\n\"Now Troy had felt a siege of ten long years\nConcern and sorrow in each face appears:\nThe Grecian prophet too, with terrour fill'd\nWhat fate decree'd, but doubtfully reveal'd:\nWhen thus Apollo----\nFrom the proud top of Ida's rising hill\nA lofty pile of mighty cedars fell\nWhose trunks into a dreadful fabrick force\nAnd, let it bear the figure of a horse:\nThe spacious hollows, of whose mountain-womb\nThe choice and flower of your troops entomb\nThe Greeks, enrag'd to be so long repell'd\nWith their chief troops the beasts vast bowel's fill'd\nAnd thus their arms and all their hopes conceal'd\nStrange was the fate the rul'd unhappy Troy\nWho thought them gone, and lasting peace t'enjoy\nSo the inscription of the machine said\nAnd treacherous Synon, for their ruin made\nAll from their arms at once, and troubles run\nTo view the horse, and left th' unguarded town\nSo over-joy'd they wept: Thus even fears\nWhen joy surprizes, melt away in tears\nEnrag'd Laocoon, with prophetick beat\nPrest thro' the crowd, that on his humour wait;\nAnd with a javelin pierc'd the fatal horse\nBut fate retards the blow, and stopt its force:\nThe spear jumpt back upon the priest, so nigh\nIt gave new credit to the treachery\nYet to confirm how weak was the attempt\n'Gainst what the gods will have, his javelin sent\nResum'd with double fury, thro' his side\nAnd the large concave of the machine try'd:\nWhen from within the captive Grecians roar;\nAnd the beast trembles with another's fear\nYet to the town the present they convey\nThus a new stragem does Troy betray;\nWhile to the taken, she becomes a prey\nBut other monsters there enform our eyes\nWhat mighty seas from Teuedos arise!\nThe frighted Neptune seems to seek the shore\nWith such a noise, with such a dreadful roar:\nAs in a silent night, when, from afar\nThe dismal sound of wrecks invades the ear:\nWhen rolling on the waves two mighty snakes\nUnhappy Troy descry'd; whose circling stroaks\nHad drove the swelling surges on the rocks\nLike lofty ships they on the billows ride\nAnd with rais'd breasts the foaming flood divide:\nTheir crests they brandish and red eye-balls raise\nThat all around dispence a sulphurous blaze\nTo shore advancing, now the waves appear\nAll fire; unwonted ratlings fill the air\nThe ocean trembles at their dreadful hiss;\nAll are amaz'd: When in a Trojan dress;\nAnd holy wreaths their sacred temples bind\nLaocoon's sons were by the snakes entwin'd:\nNow t'wards heaven their little hands are thrown\nEach for his brother, not himself does moan\nAnd prays to save his ruin by his own\nBoth dye at last, thro' fear each other shou'd\nAnd to give death a greater pomp, the good\nLaocoon to their rescue vainly run\nNow gorg'd with death, they drag him on the ground\nUp to the altar, where devoted lies\nThe priest himself, a panting sacrifice\nThus with his blood the temple they prophane;\nLosing their gods; Troy's ruin thus began:\nNow the bright taper of the night appears\nGayly attended with a train of stars:\nWhen midst the Trojans, dead in sleep and wine\nThe Grecians execute their dire design:\nWhen from the open'd caverns of the horse\nLike a large flood, their hidden troops did gush;\nAnd now deliver'd, leave their horse and fear\nWith the same wanton motions colts appear:\nWhen from the plow, and heavy collar freed\nThey shake their rising crests, and try their speed\nTheir swords they brandish, and their shields they rear\nAnd fix their helmets, then begin the war:\nA party here o' th' drunken Trojans light\nAnd send them snoring to eternal night;\nAnother there now made their altars smoke\nAnd against Troy, Troy's guardian gods invoke.\"\n\nWhen Eumolpus had gone thus far in his story, the people that were\nWalking there, began to fling stones at him: But he, conscious of his\nMerit, cover'd his head, and took up his heels: I, fearing they wou'd\nHave taken me for a poet too, made after him: When we were out of\nStone shot of the enemy, \"I beseech you, sir,\" said I, \"what will you\nDo with this disease of yours? I don't wonder at the peoples humour\nSince I have hardly been acquainted with you two hours, and your\nEntertainment has been more poetry than the conversation of a man. I\nThink I must fill my pocket with stones, that when I perceive you\nGoing into a fit, I may bleed you in the head for it, with one of\n'em.\"\n\nHe turn'd to me, and, \"Dear child,\" said he, \"I rose to day without\nConsulting my fortune; tho' 'tis confest I seldom appear even on the\nStage, but such a mobb as this are laughing at me: But that I may not\nBe at difference with you too, I'll tye my self up from this humour of\nPoetry:\" \"Well, well,\" said I, \"on that condition I sup with you;\"\nUpon which, going into the poor cottage I lodg'd at, we order'd the\nMaster of it to get us a supper, and in the mean time we went to the\nBagnio, where I saw Gito standing against the wall, with towels and\nRubbing brushes in his hand; his troubl'd countenance easily perswaded\nMe he serv'd on compulsion: As soon as he saw me, with joy addressing\nHimself, he told me, that since I was not in that martial posture that\nOnce frighted him to belye his affections, he cou'd freely speak to\nMe, upon which he entreated me to pity his circumstances; and, if I\nCou'd but deliver him from so barbarous a master, since he was now\nSorry he was forc'd to be my judge, I might take my satisfaction in\nAny punishment I'de please to inflict; \"for,\" added he, \"if I must\nDye, 'twill be comfort enough to so unhappy a wretch to think that you\nAre pleas'd in 't.\"\n\nI desir'd him wave his complaints, lest our design shou'd be\nDiscover'd, and leaving Eumolpus (for in the bath he was versifying)\nWe made off thro' a dirty back-entry, as privately as we could to my\nLodgings: Where, shutting the door, I threw my arms about his neck\nAnd, tho, he was all in tears, half smother'd him with kisses: Thus we\nContinu'd without a word from either side: Gito's repeated sobs so\nDisturb'd him, he could not speak: When after a long time spent in\nThat posture, \"how unaccountable is it,\" began I, \"to love him that\nOnce forsook me! And that in this breast I shou'd feel so great a\nWound, yet have no sign of its being there! what's you' pretence for\nChusing Ascyltos? Have I deserv'd such usage?\"\n\nAfter he found I still had love for him, he began to look less\nConcerned: \"When,\" added I, \"I'm so far from desireing an umpire to\nJudge of th' ingratitude of your choice, that I neither complain of\nOr design to remember it; if I find you sincere.\"\n\nI cou'd not tell him this without a tear: When, wiping his face, says\nHe, \"Encolpius, I appeal to your memory, whether I left, you, or you\nBetray'd me. I must confess, and hope you can't blame me; when I saw\nTwo at daggers-drawing, that I ran to the strongest.\"\n\nI cou'd not but admire his wit, and to convince him of a perfect\nReconciliation, sealed it with repeated kisses\n\n'Twas now quite dark, and our supper was dishing up, when Eumolpus\nKnock'd at the door: I ask'd how many there was of 'em: And took an\nOpportunity through a chink, to see whether Ascyltos was with him: But\nFinding him alone, I soon open'd the door: He had hardly fixt himself\nOn his couch, when seeing Gito in waiting, \"on my word,\" said he, \"a\nVery Gannymed; sure Encolpius, you'll have no reason to complain to\nDay.\"\n\nI did not like to observing an entry; and was afraid I had entertain'd\nAnother Ascyltos. Eumolpus pursuing his humour, when the boy fill'd\nHim a glass, \"I had rather,\" said he, \"be in possession of thee, than\nThe whole bagnio\"; and greedily drinking it off, \"the heat I've been\nIn,\" added he, \"made this the pleasantest draught I ever took: For to\nDeal freely with ye, I narrowly scap'd a beating, for attempting, when\nI was in the bath, to deliver my thoughts of it in verse: And after I\nWas turn'd out of the bagnio, as I us'd to be out of the theatre; I\nSearch'd every place, crying as loud as I cou'd, 'Encolpius\nEncolpius.' A naked youth that had lost his cloaths, as strongly\nEcho'd back to me, 'Gito, Gito': The boys, believing me mad, ridicul'd\nMe with their mimikry: But the other was attended with a great\nConcourse of people, that with an awful admiration prais'd the youth:\nFor nature had so largely qualify'd him for a lover, his body seem'd\nBut as the skirt of the mighty member it bore: A lusty rogue! I'll\nWarrant, he'd maintain the field four and twenty hours! He therefore\nSoon found relief, for some debauch'd spark, a Roman knight, as was\nReported, flung his cloak over him, and took him home, with hopes, I\nPresume to engross so great a prize: But I was so far from meeting\nSuch civility, that even my own cloaths were kept from me, till I\nBrought one that knew me, to satisfie 'em in my character: So much\nMore profitable 'tis to improve the body than the mind.\"\n\nWhilst Eumolpus was telling his story, I often chang'd countenance:\nLooking glad at the ill fortune of my rival, but troubled at his good:\nYet did not interrupt him, lest he shou'd discover my concern: and\nWhen he had done, I told him what we had for supper\n\nI had hardly given him an account, e're our entertainment came in:\n'Twas common homely food, but very nourishing: Our half starv'd doctor\nAttacqu'd it very briskly, but when he had well fill'd himself, began\nTo tell us, philosophers were above the world, and to ridicule those\nThat condemn every thing, because 'tis common, and only to admire\nThose things that are difficult to be had: \"These vicious appetites,\"\nAdded he, \"that despise what they can cheaply come by, never taste any\nThing pure, but, like sick men, love only those things that are\nHurtful to 'em\n\n\"What's soon obtain'd, we nauseously receive\nAll hate the victory that's got with leave:\nWe scorn the good our happy isle brings forth\nBut love whatever is of foreign growth:\nNot that the fish that distant waters feed\nDo those excel that in our climate breed;\nBut these are cheaply taken, those came far\nWith difficulty got, and cost us dear:\nThus the kind she, abroad, we admire above\nTh' insipid lump, at home of lawful love:\nYet once enjoy'd, we strait a new desire\nAnd absent pleasures only do admire.\"\n\n\"Is this,\" said I, interrupting him, \"what you promis'd, that you\nWou'd not versifie to day agen? I beseech you, sir, at least spare us\nThat never pelted you: For if any of the inn shou'd find we have a\nPoet in our company, the whole neighbourhood wou'd be rais'd, and we\nShou'd dye martyrs for a wrong opinion: If nothing else will make you\nPity us, think of the galery and bath you came from\": when I had\nTreated him after this rate, the good natur'd Gito, correcting me\nSaid, I did very ill to rail at a man so much my elder; and that\nHaving offer'd a gentleman the curtsie of my table, I shou'd not so\nFar forget good breeding, to affront him when he came: With many the\nLike expressions, attended with a blush at their delivery, that\nExtreamly became him\n\n\"Happy the woman,\" said Eumolpus, \"that's blest with such a son!\nHeaven encrease your virtue: so much sense, and so much beauty we\nSeldom meet with in any one person: But, lest you shou'd think your\nCivility thrown away, you have found a lover for it: I'll give the\nWorld your praises in verse: I'll be your servant, your gardian, and\nWill follow you every where: Nor can Encolpius think himself injur'd\nHe loves another.\"\n\nEumolpus was oblig'd to the souldier that robb'd me of my sword, else\nI had turn'd the fury upon him I meant for Ascyltos: Gito reading it\nIn my countenance, under pretence of fetching water, prudently\nWithdrew: And allay'd my heat, by removing one cause of it: But my\nRage reviving, \"Eumolpus,\" said I, \"I had rather have heard even your\nVerses, that you propose to your self such hopes: I am very\nPassionate, and you are very lustful: Consider how improbable 'tis we\nShou'd agree; believe therefore I am mad, and humour the phrenzy; that\nIs, be gone immediately.\"\n\nAt this Eumolpus was in great confusion, and, without asking the\nOccasion of my passion, presently made out: But drawing the door after\nHim, what I did not in the least suspect, he lock'd me in, and\nStealing the key out of the door, ran in pursuit of Gito\n\nThe rage I was in to be so abus'd, put me upon hanging my self; and\nHaving ty'd an apron, I found in the room, to the bed-stead, committed\nMy neck to the noose I had made with its strings: When Eumolpus and\nGito came to the door, and entering, prevented my design: Gito, his\nGrief growing to a rage, made a great out-cry, and forcing me on the\nBed, \"You're mistaken,\" said he, \"Encolpius, if you fancy it possible\nFor you to dye before me: I was first in the design, and had not\nSurviv'd my choice of Ascyltos; if I had met with an instrument of\nDeath: But had not you come to my relief in the bath, I had resolv'd\nTo throw my self out of the window: And that you may know how ready\nDeath is to wait those that desire it: see--I've got what you so\nLately endeavour'd.\"\n\nUpon which, having snatch'd a rasor from Eumolpus's servant, he struck\nThree or four times 't his throat, and fell down before us: frightened\nAt the accident, I cry'd out, and falling upon him e're he had reached\nThe ground, with the same weapon, endeavoured to follow him: But\nNeither had Gito any appearance of a wound, nor did I feel my self\nHurt: For it happen'd to be a dull rasor, design'dly made so, to\nPrepare learners of the art to handle a sharper which was the reason\nEumolpus did not offer to prevent our mimick deaths, nor his man look\nConcern'd when the rasor was snatch'd from him\n\nWhile this scene was acting, the inn-keeper came in upon us, with the\nOther part of our supper; and viewing the obscene posture we were in\n\"I beseech you, sirs,\" said he, \"are ye drunk, or have fled justice\nAnd are acting it on your selves, or both? ho! who was going to make a\nGibet of the bed? What private designs are here on foot? What--was\nYour going out but now with intent to bilke me? But you shall feel\nFo't: I'll soon make ye know who rules here.\"\n\n\"What, you rascal,\" crys Eumolpus, \"do you threat too?\" And without\nMore ado flung his fist in his face: The inn-keeper took up an earthen\nPitcher we so oft had empty'd, and sending it at Eumolpus, broke his\nForehead, and immediately ran down stairs: Eumolpus, impatient of\nRevenge, snatching up a great wooden candlestick, made after him; and\nPouring his blows very thick on the inn-keeper, repair'd the injury\nWith interest: This alarm'd the whole house, and whilst the rest of\nHis guess, that by this time were most of 'em drunk; ran to see what\nWas the matter, taking an opportunity to revenge the injury Eumolpus\nHad offer'd me, I lock'd him out; and turning thus his trick upon\nHimself, at once, enjoy'd the bed and board without a rival\n\nIn the mean time, the islanders (that came in at the bustle) and cooks\nWith all their kitchin artillery set upon Eumolpus: One throws at his\nHead a hot spit with the meat on't; another with a pitchfork puts\nHimself in a martial posture against him; but especially a blear-ey'd\nOld woman, who tucking up the dirty apron she had about her, with one\nShoe on, and another off, hall'd a great mastiff and set him at\nEumolpus: But with the wooden candlestick he defended himself against\nAll his enemies\n\nWe saw all through a hole they had made by wrenching the latch from\nThe door: I wish'd him well you may imagine; but Gito had compassion\nAnd wou'd have succour'd the distrest Eumolpus; upon which, my rage\nContinuing, I gave his pitying head two or three blows with my fist;\nHe sate down on the bed and cry'd: but I so eagerly ply'd the hole, I\nMade my eyes relieve each other; and, encouraging the people against\nHim, with great satisfaction beheld the conflict: when the bailiff of\nThe island, one Bargates, whom the scuffle had rais'd from supper; was\nBrought into the room, supported by others legs, for he was troubl'd\nWith the gout, he cou'd not use his own: And having in his clownish\nManner, with a great deal of heat, made a long harangue against\nDrunkards and vagabonds, looking on Eumolpus, \"ha! what is it you,\"\nSays he, \"the excellent poet? What--has these rogues been abusing you\nAll this while?\" At what time he goes up to Eumolpus, and in a\nWhisper, \"I have a maid,\" says he, \"that flouts at me when I ask her\nThe question; prithee, if you have any love for me, abuse her in a\nCopy of verses till she's ashamed of her self.\"\n\nWhile Eumolpus was thus ingag'd with Bargates, the cryer of the town\nAnd some other officer, attended with a great concourse of people\nEntred the inn; and, shaking a smoaky rather than lighted torch he\nCarried, mouths out this; viz\n\nNOT LONG AGO, RUN AWAY FROM THE BATH, A VERY PRETTY BOY, WITH CURL'D\nHAIR, BY NAME, GITO\n\nIF ANY MAN, OR WOMAN, IN CITY, OR COUNTRY CAN TELL TALE OR TIDINGS OF\nHIM, SHALL HAVE FOR HIS REWARD 1000 SESTERCES\n\nNot far from the cryer, stood Ascyltos, clad with a coat of many\nColours; who, to incourage any discoverer, held the reward in a silver\nCharger before him\n\nUpon this, I order'd Gito to steal under the bed, and thrust his feet\nAnd hands through the cords that, as Ulysses formerly hid in a sheeps\nHide, so extended he might cheat the searchers\n\nGito immediately obey'd the motion, and fixing himself, as I directed\nOut-did Ulysses in his native art: But, that I might leave no room for\nSuspicion, I so disposed the bed-cloaths, that none could believe more\nThan my self had lain there\n\nWe had just done, when Ascyltos, with a beadle, having search'd the\nOther chambers, came to ours, which gave him greater hopes, because he\nFound the door so barr'd: But the petty officer he brought, with an\nIron crow, forc'd it open\n\nUpon Ascyltos's entry, I threw my self at his feet, and beseech'd him\nIf he had any memory of our past friendship; or any respect for one\nThat had shar'd misfortunes with him, he wou'd at least let me see the\nStill dear Gito: And to give my sham-intreaties a better colour, \"I\nSee,\" says I, \"Ascyltos, you are come with designs on my life; for to\nWhat other end could you bring those ministers of justice? Therefore\nSatisfie your rage, behold my naked bosom, let out that blood, which\nUnder pretence of a search, you come to seek.\"\n\nAscyltos, now laying aside his old grudge to me; profess'd he came in\nPursuit of nothing but Gito, that had run from him; nor desir'd the\nDeath of any man, much more of one that falls before him; and whom\nAfter a fatal quarrel with him, he held most dear\n\nThe petty officer was not so easie to me, for taking a stick out of\nThe inn-keeper's hand, he felt under the bed with it, and run it into\nEvery hole he found in the wall: Gito drew his body out of the stick's\nWay, and, breathing as gently as fear cou'd make him, held his mouth\nClose to the cords\n\nThey were hardly gone, e're Eumolpus bounc'd in upon us, for the\nBroken door cou'd stop nobody, and, in a great heat, cry'd out, \"I'll\nEarn the reward: I'll make after the Cryer, and let him know how soon\nGito may be in his custody.\"\n\nEumolpus pursuing his design, I kist his knees, and intreated him not\nTo anticipate the end of dying men; \"you wou'd be justly angry,\" added\nI, \"if you shou'd discover to 'em how you are deceiv'd: The boy run\nInto the crowd undiscovered, and where he is gone, my self can't\nSuspect. I beseech you, Eumolpus, bring back the boy, or at least\nRestore him even to Ascyltos.\"\n\nJust as I had worked him to a belief, Gito, with restraining his\nBreath, snees'd thrice so thoroughly, that he shook the bed; at which\nEumolpus, turning about, saluted him with, \"God bless you, sir;\" and\nTaking the bedding aside, saw the little Ulysses, who might have\nRaised compassion, even in a blood-thirsty Cyclops: then looking upon\nMe, \"Thou villain,\" says he, \"how have you shamm'd me? Durst you not\nTell truth, even when you was catch'd in a roguery? If some god, that\nHas the care of humane affairs, had not forc'd the boy to discover\nHimself, I had wander'd in search of him to a fine purpose.\" But\nGito, that cou'd fawn much better than I, took a cobweb dipt in oyl\nAnd apply'd to the wound in his forehead: And changing his torn coat\nFor his own mantle, imbrac'd the now reconcil'd Eumolpus, and stuck to\nHis lips: at last he spoke, and, \"Our lives,\" said he, \"most indulgent\nFather, our lives are in your power; if you love your Gito, convince\nHim that you do, by preserving him: O! could I now meet a grave in\nFlames or waves, that I, the only cause of all, might end your\nQuarrels.\"\n\nEumolpus, concern'd at our grief, and particularly mindful of Gito's\nTenderness to him; \"surely,\" says he, \"y'are the greatest of fools\nWho have souls enrich'd with virtues, that may make ye happy, yet live\nA continu'd martyrdom, raising to your selves every day new occasions\nOf grief; I, wherever I am, make my life as pleasant and free from\nTrouble, as if I expected no more of it: If you'll imitate me, never\nLet cares disturb your quiet. And to avoid Ascyltos that haunts ye in\nThese parts, I am taking a voyage to a foreign country, and shou'd be\nGlad of your company: I believe to morrow night I shall go on board\nThe vessel: I am very well known there, and you need not doubt of a\nCivil entertainment.\"\n\nHis advice appear'd to me both wise and profitable; for at once it\nDeliver'd me from Ascyltos, and gave me hopes of living more happy:\nThus oblig'd by Eumolpus's good nature, I was sorry for the late\nInjury I had done him, and began to repent I appear'd his rival, since\nIt had occasion'd so many disasters\n\nAt last, with tears, I beseech'd him to be friends with me too, for\nThat it was not in a rival's power to bound his rage; yet, that I\nWou'd try neither to say, or do any thing that may offend him: and\nHop'd so wise and good a man as he, wou'd leave in his mind no sign of\nA former quarrel: for 'twas with men as with countrys, on rude\nNeglected grounds snows lay very long, but where the fruitful earth\nWas improv'd by culture, they presently melt off, and hardly leave a\nPrint behind: Thus unfashion'd minds can't discharge their passions\nSuddenly, but where souls are inrich'd with instruction, they but\nAppear and vanish\n\n\"And to confirm the truth of what you say,\" return'd Eumolpus, \"all my\nHeat expires in this kiss; but, to prevent the designs of your\nEnemies, hasten with your wallets, and either follow me, or, if ye\nLike it, act the leaders.\"\n\nHe had not done speaking, when, hearing the door move, we turn'd\nAbout, and saw a seaman, with a beard that made him appear terribly\nGrim: who saluted Eumolpus with a \"Why dy'e stay, as if you did not\nKnow how near the time 'twas?\"\n\nAll immediately prepared for the march, Eumolpus loads his servants\nWho had been all this while asleep; I, and Gito, pack'd our things\nTogether, and, thanking our stars, enter'd the vessel\n\nWe fixt our selves, as much out of the way as we could, under deck:\nAnd it being not yet day, Eumolpus fell a-sleep: I, and Gito, cou'd\nNot take a wink: when reflecting afresh, that I had harbour'd in my\nAcquaintance, a rival more powerful than Ascyltos; I began to be much\nTroubled: but wisely allaying my grief, I thus reason'd with my self:\nIs it so troublesom to share what we love? when the best of nature's\nWorks are in common? The sun throws his rays on all. The moon, with\nHer infinite train of stars, serves to light even beasts to their\nFodder: What below can boast an excellence of nature above the waters?\nYet they flow in publick for the use of all: only love seems sweeter\nStol'n than when it's given us: so it is, we esteem nothing, unless\n'tis envy'd by others; but what have I to fear in a rival, that age\nAnd impotence conspire to render disagreeable? Who, when he has an\nInclination, his body jades under him before he can reach the goal\n\nWhen I had cheated my self with this assurance, I muffled my head in\nMy coat, and feign'd my self asleep: but on a sudden, as if fortune\nHad resolv'd to ruin my quiet; I heard one above deck groaning out:\n\"And has he scorn'd me?\" This struck me with a trembling, for it was\nA man's voice, and one I was afraid I knew: but at a greater distance\nWith the same heat, I heard a woman lamenting: \"O that some god,\" said\nShe, \"wou'd bring my Gito to my arms; tho' he banish'd himself thence;\nHow kindly wou'd I receive him!\"\n\nSo unexpected a thing drove the colour from our cheeks; I especially\nAs in a trance, was a long time speechless; when, trembling with fear\nI pull'd Eumolpus by the coat, who was now asleep; and \"I beseech you\nFather,\" said I, \"do you know the owner of this vessel, or who the\nPassengers are?\" He was very angry to be disturbed: \"And was it for\nThis reason,\" said he, \"that we chose the most private place in the\nShip; that none but your self might disturb us: or what will it\nSignifie if I tell you, that one Lycas a Tarentine owns her, and is\nCarrying one Tryph\u00c5\u201cna to Tarentum?\"\n\nFor a while I stood like one thunder-struck, when opening my bosom, I\nTrembling, cry'd out; \"At last, Fortune, you have ruin'd every part of\nMe:\" for Gito, my better half, lean'd on my breast, as if he had\nBreath'd his last: when our sweating through fear, had a little\nRecover'd our spirits: I fell at Eumolpus feet, and intreated him to\nHave compassion of two dying wretches: that is, to assist us in the\nMeans of escaping the impending mischief: \"Tho' death,\" I added\n\"wou'd be more grateful to us, if the happiness of enjoying you, did\nNot make us envy life.\"\n\nEumolpus was glad to serve us, and swore by all that's sacred, he was\nPrivy to no design against us; and that he had very innocently brought\nUs hither, for no other end, than for our company, having hir'd the\nVessel before he was acquainted with us: \"But what designs on your\nLives are here?\" added he, \"Or have we a pyrate Hannibal on board?\"\n\"Lycas,\" continued he, \"a very honourable man, is not only master and\nOwner of this vessel, but of a good estate, and having inclinations to\nTraffick, freights his vessel himself: Is this the terrible Cyclops?\nIs this the dreadful cut-throat, we must pay our carriage to? And\nBesides him, is the beautiful Tryph\u00c5\u201cna that other emblem of\nTerrour, who for her pleasure only goes with Lycas.\"\n\n\"These are the very two,\" reply'd Gito, \"we strove to avoid\": and, in\nA low voice, made Eumolpus, that trembled at the story, at once\nUnderstand the occasions of their malice to us, and our present\nDanger\n\nEumolpus was so distracted in his thoughts, he cou'd not advise, but\nBid each of us give him his opinion; \"And presume,\" says he, \"we had\nJust enter'd the Cyclops den, where Jove's thunderbolts are made. We\nMust seek a means of delivery, except we design to free us from all\nDanger, by sinking the vessel.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" began Gito, \"rather offer the pilot a reward, to direct the\nVessel to some port: and affirm the sea so disagrees with your friend\nThat if he is not so kind, you fear he'll dye: you may colour the\nPretence with tears, and appear much concern'd, that, mov'd with\nCompassion, the pilot may befriend you.\"\n\nEumolpus reply'd, that could not be effected, for not only the\nDifficulty of guiding so great a ship to a port, but a suspicion he\nWou'd necessarily have, that his friend cou'd not be so suddenly very\nIll, conspir'd against it: Then next perhaps, Lycas wou'd have a\nCuriosity to visit his sick passenger: \"Can you propose to escape by a\nMeans that will discover ye to him ye'd avoid? But presuming the ship\nCou'd be stopt in her rapid course, and that Lycas shou'd not visit\nHis sick on board: How can we get out, but all must see us? With our\nHeads muffled, or bare? If cover'd, we move every one to lend a hand\nTo sick persons; if bare, we discover our selves.\"\n\n\"A desperate disease,\" said I, \"must have a desperate cure; I know no\nBetter expedient of our delivery, than to slide into the long boat\nAnd cutting the cord, leave the rest to Fortune: Nor do I desire\nEumolpus to share the danger: For what wou'd it signifie to involve an\nInnocent person in other mens deserv'd misfortunes? We shall think\nOur selves happy, if Fortune be kind.\"\n\n\"'Twas not ill advised,\" said Eumolpus, \"if it cou'd be done; for do\nYou think to stir in the ship unobserved, when the distant motion of\nThe stars themselves can't escape the pilot's diligence? You must\nPass the only guarded part of the ship near which place the rope that\nHolds the boat is tyed: Besides, Encolpius, I wonder you did not\nRemember that one seaman was upon constant duty night and day in the\nBoat it self; nor will be mov'd from his post, without you cut his\nThroat, or fling him overboard; which consider whether you can dare\nAttempt; for my part, to go with you I would refuse no danger that\nCould give me the least hopes of getting off; but to put so low a\nValue on life, to throw it away as a useless thing, I believe even\nYour selves are unwilling: Hear whether you like my proposal; I'll put\nYe into two mantles I have here, and making holes to breathe and eat\nThrough, will place you amongst my other goods for baggage, next\nMorning I allarm the whole ship, crying out, my servants, fearing a\nGreater punishment, in the night jump into the sea; that when the ship\nMade to land, I might carry you off for baggage.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said I, \"but do you design to tye us as stocks, within\nWhich nature does not labour to be freed; or as those that use to\nSneeze and snore? Or, because I once succeeded in a like deceit? But\nSuppose we cou'd hold out a day so ty'd up, what shall we do if we're\nPut to't longer? Will the thoughts of a quiet life without cares, or\nOf our adverse fortune entertain us most? our very cloaths long bound\nUp will rot upon our backs: Can we, d'ye think, that are young, and\nNot inur'd to labour, endure to be clad like statues, and wear our\nCords as insensibly? Since we are yet to seek a way of escape, for no\nProposal has been made without an objection; see what I have thought\nOn: The studious Eumolpus, I presume, never goes unfurnisht with ink;\nIs there a better expedient, than washing our hands, face, and hair\nWith that, to appear like \u00c3\u2020thiopian slaves? when without wringing\nOur limbs, we can't but be merry, to act a cheat, that so nearly\nImposes on our enemies?\"\n\n\"And why would you not have us circumcis'd too,\" interrupted Gito\n\"that we may appear like Jews; and have our ears bor'd, to persuade\nThem we came from Arabia? and why did not you advise our faces to be\nChalk'd as well as ink'd, that we might pass for Frenchmen, as if our\nColour would make such a mighty alteration? Has a foreigner but one\nMark of distinction? Can you think anybody so ignorant to mistake you\nFor one, by that sign only? Grant our dawb'd faces wou'd keep their\nColour: Suppose it wou'd not wash off, nor our cloaths stick to the\nInk, how can we imitate their black swollen lips? the short curl of\nTheir hair? the seams on their foreheads? their circular way of\nTreading? their splay feet? or the mode of their beards? an artificial\nColour rather stains than alters the body; but, if you'll be rul'd by\nA madman, let's cover our heads, and jump into the sea?\"\n\n\"Nor Heaven nor man,\" cry'd Eumolpus, \"cou'd suffer ye make so ill an\nEnd; rather pursue this advice: My slave, as you may imagine by his\nRasor, is a piece of a barber; let him shave not only your heads, but\nAs a mark of greater punishment, your eye-brows too, and Ill finish\nYour disguise with an inscription on your foreheads, that you may\nAppear as slaves branded for some extraordinary villany: Thus the same\nLetters will at once divert their suspicion, and conceal your\nCountenance under the mask of punishment.\"\n\nWe lik'd the advice, and hasten'd the execution, when stealing to the\nSide of the vessel, we committed our heads and eye-brows to the\nBarber: Eumolpus in the meantime fill'd our foreheads with great\nLetters, and very liberally dispenc'd the known marks of fugitives\nThrough the other parts of our faces; one of the passengers, easing\nHis o're-charg'd stomach o're the side of the ship, by the moon\nPerceiving the reflection of a barber busie at so unseasonable a time\nAnd, cursing the omen that he thought presag'd a shipwreck, ran to his\nHammock, upon which we dissembled the same, but indeed had an equal\nThough different concern; and the noise over, we spent the rest of the\nNight without resting much\n\nThe next day Eumolpus, when he found Tryph\u00c5\u201cna was stirring, went to\nVisit Lycas; and after he had talk'd with him about the happy voyage\nHe hop'd from the clearness of the heavens, Lycas, turning to\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna, \"Methoughts,\" said he, \"about midnight the vision of\nPriapus appear'd to me, and told me, he had lately brought into my\nShip Encolpius that I sought for\": Tryph\u00c5\u201cna was startl'd, \"And\nYou'd swear we slept together,\" reply'd she, \"for methoughts the image\nOf Neptune having struck his trident thrice against the Baj\u00c5\u201c, told\nMe that in Lycas' ship I shou'd meet my Gito.\"\n\n\"Hence, proceeds,\" said Eumolpus, interrupting 'em, \"that veneration I\nPay the divine Epicurus, who so wittily has discovered such illusions\n\n\"When in a dream presented to our view\nThose airy forms appear so like the true;\nNor heaven nor hell the fancy'd visions sends\nBut every breast its own delusion lends:\nFor when soft sleep the body wraps in ease\nAnd from th' unactive mass our fancy frees\nWhatever 'tis in which we take delight\nAnd think of most by day, we dream at night\nThus he, the now sackt city justly fear'd\nWho all around had death and ruin shar'd\nFrom fancy'd darts believes a darkned sky\nAnd troops retreating in confusion fly:\nThere the sad funeral pomp of kings; here\nConscious plains, half drown'd in blood, appear\nHe that by day has nois'd it at the bar\nOf knaves and fools now sees the great resort\nAnd to meet justice vainly fears in court\nMisers amidst their heaps are raising new\nAnd think they oft their old hid treasure view\nAnd huntsmen the imagin'd chace pursue\nThe merchant dreams of wrecks, the ship wou'd save\nOr now, by sinking it, himself preserve\nThe mistress to her distant lover writes;\nAnd, as awake, with flames and darts indites:\nThe good wife dreaming of her stallion's charms\nOft seeks the pleasure in her cuckold's arms\nDogs on full cry, in sleep, the hare pursue\nAnd hapless wretches their old griefs renew.\"\n\nBut Lycas, when he had thank'd his stars for their care of him, \"That\nWe may not seem,\" said he, \"to condemn the divine powers, what hinders\nBut we search the vessel?\"\n\nUpon which one \u00c3\u2020sius, the passenger that had discover'd us by our\nReflection in the water, cry'd out, \"these are the men that were\nShav'd by moonshine to night. Heaven avert the omen! I thought the\nCeremony of cutting the nails and hair, was never perform'd but as a\nSolemn sacrifice to appease a storm.\"\n\n\"Is 't so,\" says Lycas, in a great heat, \"did any in the ship offer to\nShave themselves, and at midnight too? Bring 'em quickly hither, that\nI may know who they are that deserve to die a sacrifice for our\nSafety.\"\n\n\"'Twas I,\" quoth Eumolpus, \"commanded it, not wishing ill to the ship\nBut ease to my self; for they are my slaves, and having long staring\nHairs, I order'd the uncomely sight to be taken away; not only that I\nMight not seem to make a prison of the ship; but that the mark of\nTheir villany might more plainly appear; and to let you know how\nRichly they deserve the punishment; among other rogueries, they rob'd\nMe of a considerable sum of money, and spent it with all the luxury of\nRich debauches, on a trull that was at both their services, whom I\nCatcht them with last night. In short, they yet smell of the wine\nThey profusely gave themselves with my money.\"\n\nLycas, that the offenders might atone for their crime, order'd each of\nThem forty stripes; we were immediately brought to the place of\nExecution; where the enrag'd seamen set upon us with ropes-ends, and\nTry'd to offer our blood a sacrifice for their safety. I bore three\nStripes very heroically. Gito, who had not so much passive valour at\nThe first blow, set up such an out-cry that the known sound of his\nVoice reach'd Tryph\u00c5\u201cna's ear; who in great disorder attended with\nHer maids, that were all like her self surpriz'd at the voice, run to\nThe sufferer\n\nGito's admirable beauty had soften'd their rage, and seem'd without\nSpeaking to intreat their favour; when the maids unanimously cry'd\nOut, \"'tis Gito, 'tis Gito; hold your barbarous hands, help madam\n'tis Gito!\"\n\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna to their cry inclin'd her ears, that already had\nAnticipated her belief, and with eager haste flew to the boy\n\nUpon which Lycas that knew me very well, as much satisfied as he had\nHeard my voice, ran to me, and taking my other parts on content, sed\nContiguo ad inguina mea luminibus deflexis movit officiosam manum\n\"your servant Encolpius,\" says he, \"'twill be no wonder how Euryclea\nThat nurs'd Ulysses, at his return after twenty years absence, shou'd\nKnow him by a scar on his forehead, when 'tis consider'd, the most\nDiscreet Lycas, not beholden to the marks of any seen part of the\nBody, so judiciously discover'd me by the most hid:\" Tryph\u00c5\u201cna\nHaving cheated herself into a belief that those marks of slavery we\nWore on our foreheads were real, wept; and began in a low voice, to\nInquire what prison cou'd stop us in our rambles; or whose cruel hands\nCou'd finish such a punishment without reluctancy. \"I confess,\" added\nShe, \"they deserve some punishment with whom their masters are so\nJustly angry.\"\n\nLycas was in great heat at Tryph\u00c5\u201cna's tenderness. \"And thou\nFoolish woman,\" said he, \"can you believe, those marks were cut before\nThe ink was laid? We should be too happy were those stains not to be\nRub'd off, and had justly been, as they design'd us, the subject of\nTheir laughter, if we had suffer'd our selves to be so grossly impos'd\nOn in a sham inscription.\"\n\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna, who was not yet unmindful of our former amours, wou'd\nHave pity'd us. When Lycas, still resenting the abuse he received in\nHis vitiated wife, and the affronts at the porch of Hercules' temple\nWith greater rage cry'd out, \"I thought you had been convinc'd\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna, that Heaven has the care of humane affairs, when it not\nOnly brought our enemies into our power, which they strove to avoid\nBut reveal'd it in a vision to us both; see what you'l get by\nPardoning them, whom Heaven it self has brought to punishment, for my\nPart, I am not naturally so cruel, but am afraid the judgment I shou'd\nPrevent from justly falling upon others, may light on my own head.\"\n\nThis superstitious harangue, turn'd Tryph\u00c5\u201cna from hindring our\nPunishment to hasten its execution. When she began afresh as highly\nTo resent the former affronts that was offer'd her, as Lycas did the\nRepute of his modesty that he had lost in the peoples esteem\n\nWhen Lycas found Tryph\u00c5\u201cna was with himself eagerly inclin'd to\nRevenge, he order'd to increase our punishments, which when Eumolpus\nPerceiv'd, he endeavour'd to mitigate after this manner\n\n\"I pity the wretches,\" said he, \"that lie at your mercy. Lycas, they\nImplore your compassion, and choosing me as a man not altogether\nUnknown to 'em to perform the office, desire to be reconcil'd to them\nThey once held most dear. Can you believe, 'twas by accident they\nFell into your hands, when all passengers make it their chief business\nTo enquire to whose care they are to trust themselves? When you are\nSatisfied of their intentions, can you be so barbarous to continue\nYour revenge, but suffer free-born men to go uninjur'd where they have\nDesign'd. Even barbarous and implacable masters allay their cruelty\nWhen their slaves repent; and all give quarter to the enemy that\nSurrenders himself. What can you, or will you desire more? You have\nAt your feet repenting supplicants; they're gentlemen, and men of\nWorth; and what's more prevailing than both, were once caress'd as\nYour dearest friends. Had they rob'd you of your money, or betray'd\nYour trust, by Hercules the punishment they've inflicted on themselves\nMight have satisfied your rage; don't you see the marks of slaves on\nTheir faces; who, though free, to attone their injuries to you\nProscrib'd themselves.\"\n\n\"To avoid confusion,\" interrupted Lycas, \"give me a reason for all\nParticulars as I shall ask you; and first, if they came with design to\nSurrender themselves, why did they cut off their hair? for all\nDisguises are assum'd rather to deceive than satisfie the injur'd\n\n\"Next, if they expected to ingratiate them selves by their\nEmbassadour, why have you endeavoured in everything, to conceal them\nYou were to speak for? whence it plainly appears, 'twas by accident\nThe offenders were brought to punishment, and that you have us'd this\nArtifice to divert our suspicion. Sure you thought to raise our envy\nBy ringing in our ears, that they were gentlemen, and men of worth;\nBut have a care their cause don't suffer by your impudence; what\nShou'd the injur'd do when the guilty come to 'em to be punisht? And\nIf they were my friends, they deserve to be more severely treated; for\nHe that wrongs a stranger is call'd a rogue, but he that serves a\nFriend so, is little less than a parricide.\"\n\n\"I am sencible,\" said Eumolpus, answering this dreadful harangue\n\"that nothing cou'd happen to these unhappy young men more unfortunate\nThan the cutting their hair off at midnight, which is the only\nArgument that may perswade you to mistake their voluntary coming here\nFor accidental; but I shall as candidly endeavour to undeceive you, as\nIt was innocently acted: before they imbarkt they had designs to ease\nTheir heads of that, as troublesome as useless weight, but the\nUnexpected wind that hasten'd us on board, made 'em defer it; nor did\nThey suspect it to be of any moment where 'twas done, being equally\nIgnorant of the ill omen, and customs of mariners.\"\n\n\"What advantage,\" reply'd Lycas, \"cou'd they propose to themselves by\nThe loss of their hair? unless they thought baldness might sooner\nRaise our compassion: Or can you believe I wou'd be satisfy'd in your\nRelation? when addressing himself to me, What poyson, said he, thou\nVillain, has eat your hair off? To what god have your sacrilegious\nHands offer'd it?\"\n\nThe fear of punishment struck me speechless; nor cou'd I find any\nThing to urge in my defence against so plain an accusation. Then the\nConfusion I was in, my disfigur'd face, with the equal baldness of my\nHead and eye-brows, gave a ridiculous air to everything I said or did;\nBut when they wip'd us with a wet spunge, the letters melting into\nOne, spread o'er our faces such a sooty cloud that turn'd Lycas's rage\nTo a perfect loathing. Eumolpus cou'd not endure to see free-born men\nAgainst all law and justice so abus'd, and returning their threats\nWith blows, not only was our advocate but champion too. He was\nSeconded by his man, and two or three sick passengers appear'd our\nFriends, that serv'd rather to encourage us, than encrease our force\n\nUpon which I was so far from begging pardon, that without any respect\nI held my fists at Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, and plainly told her she shou'd feel\nMe, if her lecherous ladiship, who only in the ship deserv'd to be\nPunisht, was not content to decline her pretentions to Gito\n\nThe angry Lycas was all rage at my impudence; and very impatient of\nRevenge when he found, without any concern for my own cause, I stood\nUp for another's\n\nNor was Tryph\u00c5\u201cna less disturb'd at my contempt of her; at what time\nEvery one in the vessel choose his side and put himself in a posture\nOf defence\n\nOn our side Eumolpus's slave distributed the instruments of his trade\nAnd reserv'd a razor to defend his own person; on the other\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna and her attendants advanc'd, armed with nothing but their\nNails and tongues; which last supply'd the want of drums in their\nArmy; when the pilot, crying out, threaten'd he wou'd leave the ship\nTo the mercy of the waves if they continued the bustle rais'd about\nThe lust of two or three vagabonds\n\nThis did not in the least retard the fight; they pressing for revenge\nWe for our lives: in short, many fell half dead on both sides; others\nWithdrew, as from greater armies, to be drest of their wounds; yet\nThis damps not the rage of either side\n\nThen the bold Gito, drawing out that part of him Tryph\u00c5\u201cna most\nAdmired, clapt a bloody razor to't, and threaten'd to cut away the\nCause of all our misfortunes, but Tryph\u00c5\u201cna did not faintly send to\nPrevent so cruel an act: I often offer'd at my throat too, but with as\nLittle design to kill my self as Gito to do what he threaten'd: he the\nMore boldly handl'd his because he knew it to be the same blunt razor\nHe had us'd before; which made Tryph\u00c5\u201cna very apprehensive of his\nTragic intentions\n\nUpon this, both sides drew up their ranks, when the pilot perceiving\nHow commical a war it was, with much ado was perswaded to let\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna dispatch an herald to capitulate: Articles immediately\nAccording to the custom of countries being mutually agreed off on both\nSides; Tryph\u00c5\u201cna snatcht an olive-branch, the ensign of peace, that\nStuck to the image of prosperity pictur'd in the ship, and holding it\nIn the midst of us, thus addrest her self\n\n\"What fury did these sudden broils engage\nHow have their guiltless hands deserv'd your rage?\nNo Paris a stol'n dame to Troy conveys\nNo witch Media here her brother slays:\nBut slighted love must needs resenting be:\nAnd midst the waves who is the raging he\nNow rob'd of arms that can attempt my fate?\nBy whom is simple death so little thought?\nLet not your murderous rage out storm the seas\nAnd dangers of the angry waves increase.\"\n\nWhen in a great heat Tryph\u00c5\u201cna had thus said, both armies stood\nStill a while, and reviving the treaty of peace, put a stop to the\nWar. Our captain Eumolpus prudently us'd the occasion of her\nRepentance, and having first severely chastiz'd Lycas, sign'd the\nArticles, which were as follow\n\n\"Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, you do from the bottom of your heart, as you are in\nPerfect mind, promise never to complain of any injury you have\nReceiv'd from Gito; nor mention, upbraid him with, or study to revenge\nDirectly or indirectly any action of his before this day; and to\nPrevent your forcing him to an unwilling compliance, be it further\nAgreed, that you never kiss, coll, or bring him to a closer hug\nWithout the forfeiture of 100 denarii: And for better security, that\nYou always pay your mony, before you have your ware\n\n\"Item, you Lycas, from the bottom of your heart, as you are in perfect\nMind; do promise never to reproach, or insultingly treat Encolpius\nEither in words, or gestures: But, on the forfeiture of 200 denarii\nFor each time you abuse him, behind his back.\"\n\nConditions thus agreed on, we laid down our arms: And, least any\nGrudge might still remain, wipe off the memory of all things past, in\nRepeated kisses\n\nAll quarrels expir'd in universal shouts, and a sumptuous banquet that\nFollowed, spread equal mirth through the whole company: The vessel\nRung with songs, the ensigns of their joy: and the occasion of a\nSudden calm, gave other diversions: Here a little artist bob'd for\nFish, that rising, seem'd with haste to meet their ruin: There another\nDraws the unwilling prey, that he had betray'd on the hook, with an\nInviting bait: When looking up, we saw sea-birds sitting on the\nSail-yard, about which, one skill'd in that art having plac'd\nLime-twigs, made 'em his booty. Their downy feathers, the air whirl'd\nAbout: The other, the sea vainly tost too and fro\n\nNow Lycas began to be friends with me: and Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, as a mark of\nHer love, threw the bottom of her wine upon Gito: At what time\nEumolpus, quite drunk, aim'd at rallery on those that were bald and\nBranded; till having spent his life-less stock, he return'd to his\nVerses; and designing an elegy on the loss of hair, thus began\n\nNature's chief ornament, the hair is lost\nThose vernal locks, feel winter's blast:\nNow the bald temples mown their banish'd shade\nAnd bristles shine o' the sun-burnt head\nThe joys, deceitful nature does first pay\nOur age, it snatches first away\nUnhappy mortal, that but now\nThe lovely grace of hair, did'st know:\nBright as the sun's or Cynthia's beams\nNow worse than brass, and only seems\nLike th' mushroom, that in gardens springs\nFrom sporting girls, you'll frighted run\nAnd that death will the sooner come:\nKnow that part of your head is gone\n\nHe wou'd have condemn'd us to hear more, and I believe worse than the\nFormer; if an attendant of Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, had not disturb'd him: who\nTaking Gito aside, dress'd him up in her mistresses tower; and to\nRestore him perfectly to his former figure, drawing false eye-brows\nOut of her patch-box, placed 'em so exactly, Nature might have\nMistaken 'em for her own work\n\nAt the sight of the true Gito, Tryph\u00c5\u201cna wept for joy: Who, not\nBefore, cou'd hug him with so real a satisfaction\n\nI was glad to see his loss so well repair'd: Yet, often hid my head\nAs sensible I appear'd with no common deformity, whom even Lycas\nThought not worth speaking to: But 'twas not long e'er the same maid\nCame to my relief, and calling me aside, dress'd me in a peruke no\nLess agreeable: for being of golden locks, it rather improv'd my\nComplexion\n\nBut, Eumolpus, our advocate, and reconciler, to entertain the company\nAnd keep up the mirth, began to be pleasant on the inconstancy of\nWomen: how forward they were to love, how soon they forgot their\nSparks: and that no woman was so chast, but her untry'd lust, might be\nRais'd to a fury: nor wou'd he bring instances from ancient tragedies\nOr personages celebrated in antiquity: but entertain us, if we wou'd\nPlease to hear, with a story within the circle of his own memory: upon\nWhich the eyes and ears of all were devoted to him: who thus began\n\n\"There was at Ephesus a lady, of so celebrated virtue, that the women\nOf neighbouring nations came to join their admiration with that of her\nOwn country: This lady at the death of her husband not content with\nTearing her hair, or beating her breast, those common expressions of\nGrief; but following him into the vault, where the body plac'd in a\nMonument, she, after the Gr\u00c3\u00a6cian custom, watch'd the corps, and\nWhole nights and days continu'd weeping; the perswasions of parents\nNor relations cou'd divert her grief, or make her take anything to\nPreserve life, the publick officers at last, she guarding the body for\n'em, left the vault; and lamented by all for so singular an example of\nGrief, liv'd thus five days without eating\n\n\"All left her but a faithful maid, who with tears supply'd her\nAfflicted lady, and as often as the lamp they had by, began to expire\nRenew'd the light; by this time she became the talk of the whole town;\nAnd all degrees of men confest, she was the only true example of love\nAnd chastity\n\n\"In the meantime there happening a trial of criminals, the condemn'd\nWere order'd to be crucify'd near the vault in which the lady was\nWeeping o're the corps of her late husband. The soldier that guarded\nThe bodies lest any might be taken from the cross and bury'd, the\nNight after observ'd a light in the vault, and hearing the groans of\nSome afflicted person, prest with a curiosity common to mankind, he\nDesired to know, who, or what it was? Upon which he enter'd the\nVault, and seeing a very beautiful woman, amaz'd at first, he fancy'd\n'twas a spirit, but viewing the dead body, and considering her tears\nAnd torn face, he soon guest, as it was, that the lady cou'd not bear\nThe loss of her husband: he brings his supper with him into the vault\nAnd began to perswade the mournful lady not to continue her\nUnnecessary grief, nor with vain complaints consume her health: That\nDeath was common to all men; and many other things he told her, that\nUse to restore afflicted persons to that calmness they before enjoy'd:\nBut she mov'd anew at the comfort a stranger offer'd, redoubl'd her\nGrief, and tearing her hair, cast it on the body that lay before her\n\n\"The souldier however did not withdraw, but with the like invitations\nOffer'd her somewhat to eat, till her maid o'recome, I presume, by the\nPleasing scent of the wine, no longer cou'd resist the soldier's\nCourtesie. When refresht with the entertainment she began to join her\nPerswasions to win her lady; 'and what advantage,' began she, 'wou'd\nYou reap in starving your self? in burying your self alive? What\nWou'd it signifie to anticipate your fate?'\n\n\"'D'ye think departed souls will value it?'\n\n\"'Will you, madam, in spite of Fate, revive your husband? Or will you\nShake off these vain complaints, the marks of our sex's weakness, and\nEnjoy the world while you may? The very body that lyes there might\nMake you envy life. We don't unwillingly obey when we're commanded to\nEat or live.' The lady now dry with so long fasting, suffer'd her self\nTo be o'recome; nor was she less pleas'd with her entertainment, than\nHer maid, that first surrendered. You know with what thoughts\nEncouraging meats inspire young persons. With the same charms our\nSouldier had won her to be in love with life, he addrest himself as a\nLover; nor did his person appear less agreeable to the chaste lady\nThan his conversation; and the maid, to raise her opinion of him, thus\nApply'd her self:\n\n\"And arm'd with pleasing love dare you ingage\nE're you consider in whose tents you are?\"\n\n\"To make short; nor even in this cou'd the lady deny him any thing:\nThus our victorious souldier succeeded in both; she receiv'd his\nImbraces; not only that night they struck up the bargain, but the next\nAnd third day: Having shut the door of the vault, that if any of her\nAcquaintances or strangers had come out of curiosity to see her, they\nMight have believ'd the most chaste of all women, had expir'd on the\nBody of her husband. Our souldier was so taken with his beautiful\nMistress, and the privacy of injoying her, that the little money he\nWas master of, he laid out for her entertainment, and, as soon as\n'twas night, convey'd it into the vault\n\n\"In the mean time the relations of one of the malefactors, finding the\nBody unguarded, drew it from the cross and bury'd it. The souldier\nThus rob'd while he was in the vault, the next day, when he perceiv'd\nOne of the bodies gone, dreading the punishment, he told the lady what\nHad happened; and, added that with his sword he wou'd prevent the\nJudges sentence; if so be she wou'd please to give him burial, and\nMake that place at once the fatal monument of a lover and a husband\n\n\"'The lady, not less merciful than chast; 'Nor wou'd Heaven allow,'\nSaid she, 'that I shou'd at once feel the loss of the only two in the\nWorld I hold most dear; I'd rather hang up the dead body of the one\nThan be the wicked instrument of the other's death.' Upon which she\nOrder'd her husband's body to be taken out of the coffin, and fixt to\nThe cross, in the room of that which was wanting: Our souldier pursued\nThe directions of the discreet lady, and the next day the people\nWonder'd for what reason that body was hung on the cross.\"\n\nThe seamen were pleas'd with the story. Tryph\u00c5\u201cna not a little\nAsham'd, lovingly apply'd her cheek to Gito's, and hid her blushes:\nBut Lycas wore an air of displeasure, and knitting his brows, said he\n\"if the governour had been a just man, he ought to have restor'd the\nHusband's body to his monument, and hung the woman on the cross.\" I\nDon't doubt it made him reflect on his own wife, and the whole scene\nOf our lust when we rob'd his vessel. But the articles he agreed to\nOblig'd him not to complain; and the mirth that ingag'd us gave him no\nOpportunity to vent his rage\n\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna entertain'd her self in Gito's arms, pressing oft his neck\nWith eager kisses, and oft disposing his new ornament, to make it\nAppear more agreeable to his face\n\nAt this I was not a little out of humour, and impatient of our new\nLeague, cou'd neither eat nor drink any thing: but with side-looks\nWisht a thousand curses on them both; every kiss and every look she\nGave him, wounded me. Nor did I yet know whether I had more reason to\nRepent the loss of my mistress, or my comrade; he having rob'd me of\nHer; and she deluded him from my arms: Both were worse than death to\nMe. And to compleat my misery, neither Tryph\u00c5\u201cna spoke to me as her\nAcquaintance, and once grateful lover; nor did Gito think me worth\nDrinking to; or what's the least he cou'd, common discourse with him:\nI believe he was tender of the new return of her favours, and afraid\nTo give her another occasion to fall out with him: Grief forc'd a\nFlood of tears from my eyes, and I stifl'd my complaints, till I was\nReady to expire\n\nWhen Lycas perceiv'd how well, tho' in this trouble my yellow ornament\nBecame me, he was inflam'd afresh; and viewing me with lovers eyes\nAddressed himself as such, when laying aside the haughty brow of a\nMaster, he put on the tender complacency of a friend: but his\nEndeavours were fruitless. At last meeting with an intire repulse\nHis love turning to a fury, he endeavour'd to ravish the favours he\nCould not win by intreaty; at what time Tryph\u00c5\u201cna unexpectedly came\nIn, and observing his wantonness; in the greatest confusion he hid his\nHead, and ran from her\n\nUpon which the more lustful Tryph\u00c5\u201cna askt, and made me tell her\nWhat those wanton caresses meant; she was inspired with new heat at\nThe relation; and mindful of our old amours, offer'd to revive our\nFormer commerce; but worn off my legs with those employments, I gave\nHer invitations but an ill return; yet she with all the desires of a\nWoman transported by her passion, threw her arms about me, and so\nClosely lockt me in her imbraces, I was forc'd to cry out; one of her\nMaids came in at the noise, and easily believing I wou'd force from\nHer the favours I had deny'd her mistress, rusht between, and loos'd\nThe bands: Tryph\u00c5\u201cna meeting with such a repulse, and even raging\nWith desire, took it more grievous at my hands, and with threats at\nHer going off, flew to Lycas; not only to raise his resentments\nAgainst me, but to join with him in pursuit of revenge\n\nBy the way observe, I had formerly been well receiv'd by this\nAttendant of Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, when I maintain'd a commerce with her\nMistress, upon that score she resented my converse with Tryph\u00c5\u201cna\nAnd deeply sighing, made me eager to know the occasion; when she\nStepping back, thus began, \"If you had any sparks of the gentleman in\nYou, you'd value her no more than a common prostitute; if you were a\nMan you wou'd not descend to such a jakes.\" These thoughts not a\nLittle disturb'd her; but I was asham'd of nothing more, than that\nEumolpus, suspecting the occasion, shou'd in his next verses make our\nSuppos'd quarrel the subject of his drollery; and lest my care to\nAvoid it shou'd prove no means of discovering it\n\nWhen I was contriving how to prevent his suspicion, Eumolpus himself\nCame in, already acquainted with what was done; for Tryph\u00c5\u201cna had\nCommunicated her grief to Gito, and endeavour'd at his cost to\nCompensate the injury I had offer'd her. Upon which Eumolpus was on\nFire, and the more, because her wantonness was an open breach of the\nArticles she had sign'd\n\nWhen the old doctor saw me, pitying my misfortune, he desir'd to know\nThe whole scene from my self; I freely told him of the gamesomeness of\nThe lewd Lycas, and Tryph\u00c5\u201cna's lustful assault, that he was already\nWell inform'd of; upon which, in a solemn oath, he swore to vindicate\nOur cause, and that Heaven was too just to suffer so many crimes to go\nUnpunisht\n\nWhile we were thus ingag'd a storm arose; now thick clouds, and th'\nInrag'd flood eclypst the day, the seamen fly to their posts as fast\nAs fear cou'd make 'em; and, pulling down the sails, leave the vessel\nTo the mercy of the tempest; for the uncertain winds made them\nHopeless of any direct course; nor did the pilot know which way to\nSteer; sometimes the unguided ship was forc'd on the coast of Sicily\nOften by contrary winds 'twas tost near Italy; and what was more\nDangerous than all, on a sudden the gathering clouds spread such\nHorrid darkness all around, that the pilot cou'd not see over the\nFore-castle; upon which all despair'd of safety; when Lycas threw\nHimself before me, and lifting up his trembling hands, \"I beseech you\nEncolpius,\" began he, \"assist the distress'd, that is restore the\nSacred vest and timbrel you took from the image of the goddess Isis;\nBe merciful as you are won't.'' At what time a whirlwind snatcht him\nUp, and threw him howling midst the flood, and soon a spiteful wave\nJust shew'd him us, and drew him back again\n\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna, hastily taken up by her faithful attendants, and plac'd\nWith her chief goods in the skiff, avoided a most certain death\n\nI, lockt in Gito's arms, not without tears, cry'd out, \"And this we\nHave merited of Heaven, that only death should joyn us; but even now I\nFear fortune will be against it; for see the waves threaten to\nO'erturn the vessel; and now the tempest comes to burst the lov'd\nBands that unite us; therefore if you really love Encolpius, let's\nKiss while we may, and snatch this last joy even in spite of our\nApproaching fate.\"\n\nWhen I had thus said, Gito threw off his mantle, and getting under\nMine, thrust his head out at top to reach my lips; but that the most\nMalicious wave might not ravish us asunder, he girt himself to me with\nThe thong that bound his wallet; and \"'tis some comfort,\" said he, \"to\nThink that by this the sea will bear us longer e're it can divorce us\nFrom each other's arms. Or, if in compassion it shou'd throw us on\nThe same shore, either the next that passes by wou'd give us a\nMonument of stone, that by the common laws of humanity he wou'd cast\nUpon us; or at least the angry waves, that seem to conspire our\nSeparation, wou'd unwittingly bury us in one grave, with the sand\nTheir rage wou'd vomit up.\" I was satisfy'd with my chain, and, as on\nMy death-bed, did now contentedly expect the coming hour\n\nIn the mean time the tempest, acting the decrees of Fate, had rent all\nThe rigging from the vessel; no mast, no rudder left, not a rope or\nPlank, but an awkward shapeless body of a ship tost up and down the\nFlood\n\nThe fisher-men that inhabited the sea-side, expecting a booty, in all\nHaste put out with their boats; but when they saw those in the vessel\nThat cou'd defend their own; they chang'd their design of pillaging to\nSuccouring\n\nAfter a salute on both sides, unwonted murmurs, lilre that of some\nBeast, labouring to get out, proceeded from beneath the master's\nCabin; upon which, following the sound, we found Eumolpus sitting\nAlone, and in his hand a large scroll of paper that he was filling\nEven to the margent, with verses; we all were amaz'd to see a man\nAmuse himself with poetry, at a time when he had reason to think each\nMinute wou'd be his last, and having drawn him, malcing a great noise\nFrom his hole, we endeavour'd to recover him from his frenzy; but he\nWas in such a heat to be disturb'd, that \"'Sdeath,\" said he, \"let me\nMake an end of this couplet, it finishes the poem;\" on which I took\nHold of the mad man, and order'd the still murmuring poet to be hall'd\nOn shore\n\nWhen with some trouble we had got him on shore, we very pensively\nEnter'd one of the fishermen's huts, and howe're we feasted on our\nMeats the sea had corrupted, we had no comfortable night of 't\n\nThe next day, as we were proposing how to bestow our selves, we\nDiscover'd an human body floating on a little wave that made to shore:\nI stood still concern'd, and began with more diligence to see, if what\nWas presented to our view was real\n\nWhen, finding it to be a man's: and \"who knows,\" I cry'd out, \"but\nThis wretch's wife, in some part of the world, secure at home, may\nExpect his coming; or perhaps a son, ignorant of the fatal storm, may\nWait the wisht arrival of his father; who with so many kisses seal'd\nHis unwilling parting: These are our great designs! vain mortals swell\nWith promising hopes, yet there's the issue of them all! see the\nMighty nothing how it's tost!\"\n\nWhen I had thus bemoan'd the wretch, as one unknown, the sea cast him\nOn land with his face, not much disfigur'd, toward Heaven; upon which\nI made up to it, and easily knew that the but now terrible and\nImplacable Lycas was lying at my feet\n\nI could not restrain my tears; but, beating my breast, \"Now where's,\"\nSaid I, \"your rage? where your unruly passions? now you're expos'd a\nPrey to fish and beasts; and the poor shipwrackt wretch, with all his\nBoasted power, now has not one plank of the great ship he proudly\nCall'd his own. After this, let mortals flatter themselves with\nGolden dreams, let the weary miser heap up ill-got wealth for many\nYears; 'twas but yesterday this lifeless thing was priding in its\nRiches, and had fixt the very day he thought to return. How short\nAlas! eyes the poor wretch of his design! but 'tis not the sea only we\nShould fear: one the wars deceive; another by some accidental ruin\nEven at the altar, meets a grave; third by a fall in running\nAnticipates his arrival to the goal; eating oft kills the greedy; and\nAbstinence the temperate. If we rightly consider it in this sea of\nLife we may be shipwrackt every where; but we vainly lament the want\nOf burial to a wretch that's drowned; as if it concern'd the perishing\nCarcass, whether flames, worms, or fishes were its cannibals\nWhatever way you are consum'd, the end of all 's the same. But fish\nThey object, will tear their bodies; as if their teeth were less\nGentle than the flames; a punishment that we believe is the highest we\nCan inflict on slaves that have provok'd us; therefore what madness is\n't to trouble our lives with the cares of our burial after we're dead;\nWhen the best of us may meet the fate he vainly strives with so much\nDiligence to avoid?\"\n\nAfter these reflections, we perform'd the last office for the dead\nAnd tho' his enemies, honour'd him with a funeral pile; but while\nEumolpus was making an epitaph, his eyes roam'd here and there, to\nFind an image that might raise his fancy\n\nWhen we had willingly acquitted our selves of this piece of humanity\nTo Lycas, we pursu'd our design'd journey, and all in a sweat soon\nReacht the head of a neighbouring hill, from whence we discovered a\nTown seated on the top of a high mountain; we did not know it, till a\nShepherd inform'd us 'twas Crotona; the most ancient and once most\nFlourishing city of Italy; when we enquir'd of him what sort of people\nInhabited this renown'd place, and what kind of commerce they chiefly\nMaintain'd, since they were impoverish'd by so many wars?\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"if you have designs of trading, you must go\nAnother way; but if you're of the admir'd sort of men, that have the\nThriving qualifications of lying and cheating, you're in the direct\nPath to business; for in this city no learning flourisheth, eloquence\nHas not a room here; temperance, good manners, nor any virtue can meet\nA reward; assure your selves of finding but two sorts of men, and they\nAre the cheated, and those that cheat. A father takes no care of his\nChildren, because the having of heirs is such a mark of infamy, that\nHe who is known in that circumstance, dares not appear at any publick\nGame or show, is deny'd all publick priviledges, and only herds among\nThose that all men piss upon. But single men, who have no tyes of\nNature that oblige the disposal of their wealth, are caress'd by all\nAnd have the greatest honours confer'd on 'em; they are the only\nValorous, the only brave; nay, and only innocent too. You're going to\nA city,\" added he, \"like a field in a plague-time, where you can\nObserve nothing but one man devouring another, as crows dead\nCarcasses.\"\n\nThe prudent Eumolpus, as a thing so surprizingly new, began to be\nThoughtful, and confest that way to riches did not displease him. I\nBeliev'd it the effect of a poetick gaiety, that had not left his\nYears. When, \"I wish,\" continued he, \"I cou'd maintain a greater\nFigure, as well in habit as attendants, 'twou'd give a better colour\nTo my pretences: By Hercules, I'd throw by the wallet, and soon\nAdvance all our fortunes.\"\n\nPromising therefore to supply his wants, \"we have with us,\" said I\n\"the sacred vest of Isis, and all the booty we made at Lycurgus's\nVillage; and you have given me such hopes, Eumolpus,\" added I, \"that\nWere the goddess her self in my power, I'd pawn her for money to carry\nOn the design.\"\n\nUpon which, said Eumolpus, \"why delay we the bringing of our hands in\nUse? and if you like the proposal let me be called your master.\"\n\nNone e're condemned a project that was no charge to him; therefore to\nBe true to his interests, we engag'd in an oath before we wou'd\nDiscover the cheat to suffer ten thousand racks; and thus like\nFree-born gladiators selling our liberty, we religiously devoted both\nSoul and body to our new master\n\nAfter the solemn ceremonies of our oath were ended; like slaves, at a\nDistance, we salute the master of our own making. When beginning to\nExercise his authority, he commanded us to report that our ancient\nLord (meaning him) griev'd at the loss of a son, who was a great\nOrator and comfort to his age, was unhappily forc'd to quit the place\nOf his abode, lest the daily salutes of those that expected preferment\nUnder him, or visits of his companions, might be the continual\nOccasions of tears; and the late shipwrack had added to his grief\nHaving lost to the value of twenty thousand crowns; tho' he was not so\nMuch concern'd at the loss of his money, as of his large retinue;\nThat, he fear'd, would make them not proportion their thoughts to his\nGreatness; and to add, that our lord had mortgages on half the estates\nIn Africa, and mighty sums at use on personal security; and cou'd\nRaise of his own gladiators, disperst about Numidia, a force able to\nPlunder Carthage\n\nAfter this, that his actions might agree with his condition, 'twas\nConcluded necessary to wear an air of discontent; that he should with\nA stately stiffness, like quality, often cough, and spit about the\nRoom; that his words might come the more faintly from him; that in the\nEye of the world he shou'd refuse to eat or drink; ever talking of\nRiches, and sometimes, to confirm their belief, shou'd break into\nThese words; Strange that such or such a seat shou'd disappoint my\nExpectation, that us'd to be blest with so large an increase! And\nThat nothing might be wanting to compleat the humour, as often as he\nHad occasion to call any of us, he shou'd use one name for another;\nThat it might easily appear how mindful the lord was even of those\nServants he had left in Africk\n\nMatters thus order'd, having, as all that wou'd thrive in the world\nImplor'd the assistance of Heaven, we began our march, but both Gito\nDid not like his new slavery, and Eumolpus's hir'd servant, bearing\nMost of our baggage, in a little time beginning to be uneasie in his\nService, wou'd often rest his burden; and with ten thousand wry looks\nAnd as many curses for our going so fast, at last swore he would\nEither leave his charge, or go quite away with 't. \"'Sdeath,\" said\nHe, \"d'ye think I'm a pack-horse, or a dray, that you load me thus? I\nWas hir'd for a man, not a horse; nor am I less a gentleman by birth\nThan any of you all; tho' my father left me in a mean condition.\" Nor\nContent with reproaches, but getting before us, he lift up one leg\nAnd, venturing his choler at the wrong end, filled our nostrils with a\nBeastly scent\n\nGito mockt his humour, and for every crack he gave, return'd the like\nThat one ill-scent might stifle another\n\nBut, even here, Eumolpus returning to his old humour: \"Young men,\"\nBegan he, \"this poetry deceives many; for not only every one that is\nAble to give a verse its numbers, and spin out his feble sence in a\nLong train of words, has the vanity to think himself inspir'd; but\nPleaders at the bar, when they wou'd give themselves a loose from\nBusiness, apply themselves to poetry, as an entertainment without\nTrouble; believing it easier to compile a poem than maintain a\nControversie, adorn'd with a few florid sentences. But neither will a\nGenerous spirit affect the empty sound of words; nor can a mind\nUnless enricht with learning, be deliver'd of a birth of poetry; there\nMust be the purity of language, no porterly expression, or meanness\nAs I may call it, of words is to be admitted; but a stile perfectly\nAbove the common, and with Horace,--\n\n\"'Scorn the unletter'd herd\nAnd drive 'em from you.'\n\n\"Besides, you must be strictly diligent, that your expressions appear\nOf a piece with the body of the discourse, and your colours so laid\nThat each may contribute to the beauty of the whole. Greece has given\nUs a Homer and the Lyricks for example; Rome a Virgil and an Horace;\nThe purity of whose language is so happily correct, others either\nNever saw the path that leads to poetry, or seeing, were afraid to\nTread it. To describe the civil wars of Rome would be a master-piece\nThe unletter'd head that offers at it, will sink beneath the weight of\nSo great a work; for to relate past actions, is not so much the\nBusiness of a poet, as an historian; the boundless genius of a poet\nStrikes through all mazes, introduces gods, and puts the invention on\nThe rack for poetick ornaments; that it may rather seem a prophetick\nFury, than a strict relation, with witnesses of meer truth. As for\nExample, this rapture, tho' I have not given it the last hand\n\n\"Now Rome reign'd Empress o're the vanquished ball\nAs far as earth and seas, obey'd by all:\nUneasie yet, with more desires she's curst\nAnd boundless, as her empire, is her thirst\nIn burden'd vessels now they travelled o're\nThe furrow'd deep to seas unknown before:\nAnd any hidden part of land or sea\nThat gold afforded, was an enemy\nThus fate the seeds of civil fury rais'd\nWhen great in wealth no common pleasure pleas'd\nDelights more out of fashion by the town:\nTh' souldiers scarlet now from Spain must come;\nThe purple of the sea contemn'd is grown\nIndia with silks, Africk with precious stone\nArabia with its spices hither come\nAnd with their ruin raise the pride of Rome\nBut other spoils, destructive to her peace\nRome's ruin bode, and future ills encrease:\nThrough Libyan desarts are wild monsters chas'd\nAnd the remotest parts of Africk trac'd:\nWhere the unwieldy elephant that's ta'en\nFor fatal value of his tooth is slain\nUncommon tygers are imported here\nAnd triumphant in the theatre;\nWhere, while devouring jaws on men they try\nThe people clap to see their fellows die\nBut oh! who can without a blush relate\nThe horrid scene of their approaching fate?\nWhen Persian customs, fashionable grown\nMade nature start, and her best work disown\nMale infants are divorc'd from all that can\nBy timely progress ripen into man\nThus circling nature dampt, a while restrain\nHer hasty course, and a pause remains;\nTill working a return t'her wonted post\nShe seeks her self, and to her self is lost\nThe herd of fops the frantick humour take\nEach keeps a capon, loves its mincing gate\nIts flowing hair, and striving all it can\nIn changing mode and dress, t' appear a man\nBehold the wilder luxury of Rome\nFrom Africk furniture, slaves, tables come\nAnd purple carpets made in Africk loom\nThus their estates run out, while all around\nThe sot-companions in their wine are drown'd;\nThe souldier loads, neglected is his sword\nWith all his spoils the dearly noble board:\nRome's appetite grows witty, and what's caught\nIn Sicily, to their boards are living brought:\nBut stomachs gorg'd, (a dearer luxury)\nMust with expensive sauce new hunger buy\nThe Phasian banks, the birds all eaten, gone\nWith their forsaken trees in silence moan\nAnd have no musick but the winds alone\nIn Mars's Field no less a frenzie reigns\nWhere brib'd assemblies make a prey of gains\nTheir servile votes obey the chink of gold\nA people and a senate to be sold!\nThe senate's self, which should our rights maintain\nFrom their free spirits, stoop to sordid gain\nThe power of right by gold corrupted dies\nAnd trampled majesty beneath it lies:\nCato's pretence the giddy rout neglect\nYet did not him, but him they rais'd deject:\nWho, tho' he won, with conscious blushes stands\nAsham'd o' th' Power he took from worthier hands\nO manners, ruin, and the people's shame!\nHe suffer'd not alone, the Roman name\nVirtue and honour to their period came\nThus wretched Rome does her own ruin share\nAt once the merchant, and at once the ware\nAll lands are mortgag'd, and all persons bound\nAnd in the use the principal is drown'd\nThus debt's a feaver, and like that disease\nBred in our bowels, by unfelt degrees\nWill through our thirsty vitals ev'ry member seize\nWild tumults now to arms for succour call\n(For what may dare and never fear a fall.)\nWasted by riot, wealth's a putrid sore\nThat only wounds can its lost strength restore\nWhat rules of reason, or soft gentle ways\nRome from this lethargy of vice can raise?\nWhere such mild arts can no impression make\nWar, tumult, noise and fury must awake\nFortune one age with three great chiefs supply'd\nWho different ways, by the sword that rais'd 'em dy'd;\nCrassus's blood, Asia;

Thus Discord said\nAnd impious earth her black decrees obey'd.\"\n\nWhen Eumolpus, with his usual freedom, had deliver'd himself of this\nWe arrived at Crotona, where having refresht our selves in a little\nInn, we took up at the next day, designing an enlargement of our house\nAnd fortune, we fell into the company of some parasitical Corbacchio's\nWho immediately enquir'd what we were and whence we came? When\nAccording to our contrivance, prudently advancing our characters, we\nTold the credulous parasites whence we came, and who we were. Upon\nWhich, immediately all their fortunes were at Eumolpus's feet, and\nEach, to ingratiate himself into his favour, strove to exceed the rest\nIn presenting him\n\nWhile this flood of fortune was for a long time flowing on us\nEumolpus, 'midst his happiness, having lost the memory of his former\nCondition, so boasted his interest, that he affirm'd none in Crotona\nCou'd resist his desires; and that what e're crime any of us shou'd\nAct, he had friends enough to wipe off the guilt\n\nBut, tho' our daily increasing riches, left my pamper'd body no desire\nUnsatisfy'd; and tho' I flatter'd my self into an opinion that ill\nFortune had taken her last leave of me, yet not only the thoughts of\nMy present condition, but the means of getting to 't, wou'd oft break\nIn upon my joys, and bitter all the sweet. \"And what,\" said I to\nMyself, \"if some one, wiser than the rest, shou'd dispatch a messenger\nFor Africk; shou'd not we soon be discover'd? What if the slave\nEumolpus, pickt up, glutted with his present happiness, shou'd betray\nUs to his companions, and maliciously discover the whole cheat? We\nShould then be put upon the strole again, and be oblig'd with shame to\nRenew our former beggary. Heavens, how ill it fares with wicked\nLives! they ever expect the punishment they deserve.\"\n\nGoing out full of these thoughts to divert my concern, I resolv'd on a\nWalk, but I had scarce got into a publick one, e're a pretty girl made\nUp to me, and calling me Poly\u00c3\u00a6mus, told me her lady wou'd be proud\nOf an opportunity to speak with me\n\n\"You're mistaken, sweet-heart,\" return'd I, in a little heat, \"I'm but\nA servant, of another country too, and not worthy of so great a\nFavour.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said she, \"I have commands to you; but because you know\nWhat you can do, you're proud; and if a lady wou'd receive a favour\nFrom you, I see she must buy it: For to what end are all those\nAllurements, forsooth? the curl'd hair, the complexion advanc'd by a\nWash, and the wanton roll of your eyes, the study'd air of your gate?\nUnless by shewing your parts, to invite a purchaser? For my part I am\nNeither a witch, nor a conjurer, yet can guess at a man by his\nPhysiognomy. And when I find a spark walking, I know his\nContemplation. To be short, sir, if so be you are one of them that\nSell their ware, I'll procure you a merchant; but if you're a\nCourteous lender, confer the benefit. As for your being a servant\nAnd below, as you say, such a favour, it increases the flames of her\nThat's dying for you. 'Tis the wild extravagance of some women to be\nIn love with filth, nor can be rais'd to an appetite but by the\nCharms, forsooth of some slave or lacquy; some can be pleased with\nNothing but the strutting of a prize-fighter with a hackt-face, and a\nRed ribbon in his shirt: Or an actor betray'd to prostitute himself on\nTh' stage, by the vanity of showing his pretty shapes there; of this\nSort is my lady; who indeed,\" added she, \"prefers the paultry lover of\nThe upper gallery, with his dirty face, and oaken staff, to all the\nFine gentlemen of the boxes, with their patches, gunpowder-spots, and\nTooth-pickers.\" When pleas'd with the humour of her talk, \"I beseech\nYou, child,\" said I, \"are you the she that's so in love with my\nPerson?\" Upon which the maid fell into a fit of laughing. \"I wou'd\nNot,\" return'd she, \"have you so extreamly flatter your self. I never\nYet truckl'd to a waiter, nor will Venus allow I shou'd imbrace a\nGibbet. You must address your self to ladies that kiss the ensigns of\nSlavery; be assur'd that I, though a servant, have too fine a taste to\nConverse with any below a knight.\" I was amaz'd at the relation of\nSuch unequal passions, and thought it miraculous to find a servant\nWith the scornful pride of a lady, and a lady with the humility of a\nServant\n\nOur pleasant discourse continuing, I desir'd her to bring her lady:\nShe readily consented, and taking hold of her petticoats, tript it\nInto a lawrel labyrinth, that border'd on the walk; 'twas not long\nE're she usher'd her lady to me; a beauty excelling even the flattery\nOf painters; words can't express so perfect a creature; whatever I\nShou'd say of her wou'd fall short of what she was. Her hair spread\nAll o're her shoulders, and seem'd in easie curls to wanton in the\nAir. Her forehead oval, and that naturally inclin'd the hair to its\nAdvantage. The proportion of her eye-brows was most correct. Her\nEyes eclypst the glory of the brightest star. Her nose had an easie\nTurn, and mouth was such Pragiteless believ'd Venus had. Then her\nChin, her neck, her arms, and feet, gently girt with embroider'd\nSandals, to whose whiteness the Parian marble wou'd serve but as a\nFoil. 'Twas then I began to despise my old mistress Doris. And thus\nBroke out:\n\n\"Sure amorous Jove's a holy tale above;\nWith fancy'd arts that wait upon his love\nWhen we are blest with such a charm as this\nAnd he no rival of our happiness:\nHow well the bull wou'd now the god become:\nOr his grey-hairs to be transform'd to down?\nHere's Danae's self, a touch from her wou'd fire\nAnd make the god in liquid joys expire.\"\n\nShe was pleas'd, and smil'd with such an air, that, she seem'd like\nThe moon in all her glories breaking through a cloud, when addressing\nHer self, her pretty fingers humouring the turn of her voice, \"If a\nFine woman, and that but this year, has been acquaint'd with a man,\"\nSaid she, \"may deserve your love, let me commend a mistress to you. I\nAm sensible you have a comrade already, nor have I thought it below me\nTo inquire it: But why not a mistress too? I enter the list on the\nSame bottom with your comrade; nor do I desire to engross all the\nCaresses; only think me deserving, and confer them as you please.\"\n\n\"Let me beseech you, madam,\" return'd I, \"by all those cupids in your\nFace and meen, not to scorn to admit a stranger into the number of\nYour admirers. You'l find him most religious, if you accept his\nDevotions, and that you shou'd not suspect I believe the way to this\nHeaven, unlike all others, may be trod gratis, I present you with my\nComrade.\"\n\n\"What?\" said she, \"do you give him without whom you cou'd not live?\nOn whose lips your very being hangs? Whom you so love, as I cou'd\nYou.\" Her words were attended with such a grace at their delivery\nAnd the sweet sound so, charm'd the yielding air, you wou'd have\nSworne some syren had been breathing melodies. Thus rapt with every\nThing so amazing, and fancying a glory shin'd in every part, I\nVentur'd to enquire what name the goddess own'd? \"My maid, I\nPerceive,\" said she, \"has not inform'd you, I am call'd Circe; I would\nNot have you believe tho, I bear that name, that I derive my original\nFrom Apollo; nor that my mother, while she lay in the god's imbraces\nHeld the fiery steeds: Yet I shall know enough of heaven, if fate will\nGive you to my arms. And who knows the dark decrees? Therefore come\nMy dear, and crown my wishes. Nor need you fear any malicious\nDisturbance of our joys. Your comrade is far enough from hence.\"\n\nUpon which she threw her downy arms about me, and led me to a plat of\nGround, the pride of nature, deckt with a gay variety of every\nPleasing object\n\nOn Ida's top, when Jove his nymph carest\nAnd lawless in open view exprest:\nHis Mother Earth in all her charms was seen\nThe rose, the violet, the sweet jessamin\nAnd the fair lily smiling on the green\nSuch was the plat on which my Venus lay\nBut secret our love, more glorious the day\nWhen all around was bright, and as the nymph as gay\n\nHere we prepar'd for battel, and through ten thousand kisses prest to\nA closer engagement; but a sudden weakness rob'd me of my arms. Thus\nCheated in her expectations, she highly resenting it, asks whether her\nLips, her breath, or some ill scent of any part of her, offended me\nOr, if none of those, whether I fear'd Gito?\n\nI was so asham'd of my self, that if there was any spark of the man\nLeft in me, I lost it. And finding every part of me feeble, and as it\nWere lifeless: \"I beseech you, madam,\" said I, \"don't triumph over my\nMisery; I'm surely bewitcht.\"\n\nSo slight an excuse could not allay her resentment, but giving me a\nDisdainful glance, she turn'd to her maid, and, \"I prithee Chrysis,\"\nSaid she, \"be free with me, don't flatter your mistress. Is there any\nThing misbecoming or ungentle about me? Or have I us'd art to hide\nAny natural deformity? I don't know how you've drest me to-day.\"\n\nUpon which, e're Chrysis cou'd make a return, she snatcht a\nPocket-glass from her, and after she had practis'd all her looks, to\nTry if any appear'd less charming than before, she took hold of her\nPetticoats that were a little rumpled with lying on, and immediately\nRan to a neighbouring temple dedicated to Venus\n\nI could not tell what to say or do, but as if I had seen a vision, at\nLast began with horror to consider whether I had been rob'd of any\nReal joy\n\nSo when a dream our wandring eyes betrays\nAnd to our side some hidden gold conveys;\nOur busie hands the inviting treasure seize\nAnd hid in guilty folds the fancy'd prize\nSweating we fear lest any conscious spy\nMight search our bosom, and the theft descry\nBut with our sieep when all our joys are o're\nAnd minds restor'd to what they were before\nConcern'd, we wish the fancy'd loss regain'd\nAnd with the image still are entertain'd\n\nThis misfortune might make me justly think it not only a true vision\nBut real witchcraft; for I had so long lost my strength I cou'd not\nRise: My mind at last, a little freed, began by degrees to recover its\nVigour, upon which I went to my lodging, and dissembling a faintness\nLay down on the bed. A little after Gito, being inform'd I was ill\nCame to me, much troubl'd; but to allay his concern, I told him I was\nOnly a little weary, and had a mind for a nap. Several things I talkt\nTo him of, but not a word of my last adventure, for I was afraid\nBecause I knew he envy'd every one that had a charm for me, and to\nPrevent his suspicion, throwing my arms about him, I endeavour'd to\nGive a proof of my love; but disappointed of the expectation I had\nRais'd him to, he rose very angry from my side, and accusing my\nWeakness, and strange behaviour to him, told me that of late he had\nFound my chief favours were bestow'd in another's arms\n\n\"My love to you, Gito,\" said I, \"has ever been the same, but now my\nDancing-days submit to reason.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" said he, laughing at me, \"in the name of Socrates, I\nThank you, because like him, you propose to love me: Alcibiades\nEncolpius, did not rise a virgin from that philosopher's side.\"\n\n\"Then,\" added I, \"believe me, Gito, I hardly know I've any thing of\nMan about me, how useless lyes the terrible part, where once I was\nAchilles.\"\n\nWhen he found how unfit I was to confer the favours he wanted, and to\nPrevent suspicion, of his privacy with me, he jumpt up and ran to\nAnother part of the house\n\nHe was hardly gone, e're Chrysis enter'd my chamber, and gave me a\nBillet from her mistress, in which I found this written:\n\n\"Had I rais'd my expectation, I might deceiv'd complain; now I'm\nObliged to your impotence, that has made me sensible how much too long\nI have trifl'd with mistaken hopes of pleasure. Tell me, sir, how you\nDesign to bestow your self, and whether you dare rashly venture home\nOn your own legs? for no physician ever allow'd it cou'd be done\nWithout strength. Let me advise your tender years to beware of a\nPalsie: I never saw any body in such danger before. On my conscience\nYou are just going! and shou'd the same rude chilliness seize your\nOther parts, I might be soon, alas! put upon the severe trial of\nWeeping at your funeral. But if you would not suspect me of not being\nSincere, tho' my resentment can't equal the injury, yet I shall not\nEnvy the cure of a weak unhappy wretch. If you wou'd recover your\nStrength, ask Gito, or rather not ask him for't--I can assure a return\nOf your vigour if you cou'd sleep three nights alone: As to myself I\nAm not in the least apprehensive of appearing to another less charming\nThan I have to you. I am told neither my glass nor report does\nFlatter me. Farewell, if you can.\"\n\nWhen Chrysis found I had read the reproach, \"This is the custom, sir,\"\nSaid she, \"and chiefly of this city, where the women are skill'd in\nMagick-charms, enough to make the moon confess their power, therefore\nThe recovery of any useful instrument of love becomes their care; 'tis\nOnly writing some soft tender things to my lady, and you make her\nHappy in a kind return. For 'tis confest, since her disappointment\nShe has not been her self.\" I readily consented, and calling for\nPaper, thus addrest myself:\n\n\"'Tis confest, madam, I have often sinned, for I'm not only a man, but\nA very young one, yet never left the field so dishonourably before\nYou have at your feet a confessing criminal, that deserves whatever\nYou inflict: I have cut a throat, betray'd my country, committed\nSacrilege; if a punishment for any of these will serve, I am ready to\nReceive sentence. If you fancy my death, I wait you with my sword;\nBut if a beating will content you, I fly naked to your arms. Only\nRemember, that 'twas not the workman, but his instruments that fail'd:\nI was ready to engage, but wanted arms. Who rob'd me of them I know\nNot; perhaps my eager mind outrun my body; or while with an unhappy\nHaste I aim'd at all; I was cheated with abortive joys. I only know I\nDon't know what I've done: You bid me fear a palsie, as if the diseast\nCou'd do greater that has already rob'd me of that, by which I shou'd\nHave purchas'd you. All I have to say for my self, is this, that I\nWill certainly pay with interest the arrears of love, if you allow me\nTime to repair my misfortune.\"\n\nHaving sent back Chrysis with this answer, to encourage my jaded body\nAfter the bath and strengthening oyles, had a little rais'd me, I\nApply'd my self to strong meats, such as strong broths and eggs, using\nWine very moderately; upon which to settle my self, I took a little\nWalk, and returning to my chamber, slept that night without Gito; so\nGreat was my care to acquit my self honourably with my mistress, that\nI was afraid he might have tempted my constancy, by tickling my side\n\nThe next day rising without prejudice, either to my body or spirits, I\nWent, tho' I fear'd the place was ominous, to the same walk, and\nExpected Chrysis to conduct me to her mistress; I had not been long\nThere, e're she came to me, and with her a little old woman. After\nShe had saluted me, \"What, my nice Sir Courtly,\" said she, \"does your\nStomach begin to come to you?\"\n\nAt what time, the old woman, drawing from her bosome, a wreath of many\nColours, bound my neck; and having mixt spittle and dust, she dipt her\nFinger in't, and markt my fore-head, whether I wou'd or not\n\nWhen this part of the charm was over, she made me spit thrice, and as\nOften prest to my bosom enchanted stones, that she had wrapt in\nPurple; Admotisque manibus temptare coepit inguinum vives. Dicto\nCitius nervi paruerunt imperio manusque aniculae ingenti motu\nRepleverunt. At illa gaudio exsultans, \"vides,\" inquit, \"Chrysis mea\nVides quod aliis leporem excitavi?\"\n\nNever despair; Priapus I invoke\nTo help the parts that make his altars smoke\n\nAfter this, the old woman presented me to Chrysis; who was very glad\nShe had recover'd her mistress's treasure; and therefore hastening to\nHer, she conducted me to a most pleasant retreat, deckt with all that\nNature cou'd produce to please the sight\n\nWhere lofty plains o're-spread a summer shade\nAnd well-trimm'd pines their shaking tops display'd\nWhere Daphne 'midst the cyprus crown'd her head\nNear these, a circling river gently flows\nAnd rolls the pebbles as it murmuring goes;\nA place design'd for love, the nightingale\nAnd other wing'd inhabitants can tell\nThat on each bush salute the coming day\nAnd in their orgyes sing its hours away\n\nShe was in an undress, reclining on a flowry bank, and diverting her\nSelf with a myrtle branch; as soon as I appear'd, she blusht, as\nMindful of her disappointment: Chrysis, very prudently withdrew, and\nWhen we were left together, I approacht the temptation; at what time\nShe skreen'd my face with the myrtle, and as if there had been a wall\nBetween us, becoming more bold; \"what, my chill'd spark,\" began she\n\"have you brought all your self to day?\"\n\n\"Do you ask, madam,\" I return'd, \"rather than try?\" And throwing my\nSelf to her, that with open arms was eager to receive me, we kist a\nLittle age away; when giving the signal to prepare for other joys, she\nDrew me to a more close imbrace; and now, our murmuring kisses their\nSweet fury tell; now, our twining limbs, try'd each fold of love; now\nLockt in each others arms, our bodies and our souls are join'd; but\nEven here, alas! even amidst these sweet beginnings, a sudden\nChilliness prest upon my joys, and made me leave 'em not compleat\n\nCirce, enrag'd to be so affronted, had recourse to revenge, and\nCalling the grooms that belong'd to the house, made them give me a\nWarming; nor was she satisfi'd with this, but calling all the\nServant-wenches, and meanest of the house, she made 'em spit upon me\nI hid my head as well as I cou'd, and, without begging pardon, for I\nKnew what I had deserv'd, am turn'd out of doors, with a large retinue\nOf kicks and spittle: Proselenos, the old woman was turn'd out too\nAnd Chrysis beaten; and the whole family wondering with themselves\nEnquir'd the cause of their lady's disorder\n\nI hid my bruises as well as I cou'd, lest my rival Eumolpus might\nSport with my shame, or Gito be concern'd at it; therefore as the only\nWay to disguise my misfortune, I began to dissemble sickness, and\nHaving got in bed, to revenge my self of that part of me, that had\nBeen the cause of all my misfortunes; when taking hold of it\n\nWith dreadful steel, the part I wou'd have lopt\nThrice from my trembling hand the razor dropt\nNow, what I might before, I could not do\nFor cold as ice the fearful thing withdrew;\nAnd shrunk behind a wrinkled canopy\nHiding his head from my revenge and me\nThus, by his fear, I'm baulkt of my design\nWhen I in words more killing vent my spleen\n\nAt what time, raising myself on the bed, in this or like manner, I\nReproacht the sullen impotent: With what face can you look up, thou\nShame of heaven and man? that can'st not be seriously mention'd. Have\nI deserv'd from you, when rais'd within sight of heavens of joys, to\nBe struck down to the lowest hell? To have a scandal fixt on the very\nPrime and vigour of my years, and to be reduc'd to the weakness of an\nOld man? I beseech you, sir, give me an epitaph on my departed\nVigour; tho' in a great heat I had thus said\n\nHe still continu'd looking on the ground\nNor more, at this had rais'd his guilty head\nThan th' drooping poppy on its tender stalk\n\nNor when I had done, did I less repent of my ridiculous passion, and\nWith a conscious blush, began to think, how unaccountable it was, that\nForgetting all shame, I shou'd contend with that part of me, that all\nMen of sence, reckon not worth their thoughts. A little after\nRelapsing to my former humour: But what's the crime, began I, if by a\nNatural complaint I was eas'd of my grief? or how is it, that we blame\nOur stomachs or bellies, when 'tis our heads that are distemper'd?\nDid not Ulysses beat his breast, as if that had disturb'd him? And\nDon't we see the actors punish their eyes, as if they heard the\nTragick scene? Those that have the gout in their legs, swear at them;\nThose that have it in their fingers, do so by them: Those that have\nSore eyes, are angry with their eyes\n\nWhy do the strickt-liv'd Cato's of the age\nAt my familiar lines so gravely rage?\nIn measures loosly plain, blunt satyr flows\nAnd all the people so sincerely shows\nFor whose a stranger to the joys of love?\nWho, can't the thoughts of such lost pleasures move?\nSuch Epicurus own'd the chiefest bliss\nAnd such lives the gods themselves possess\n\nThere's nothing more deceitful than a ridiculous opinion, nor more\nRidiculous, than an affected gravity. After this, I call'd Gito to\nMe; and \"tell me,\" said I, \"but sincerely, whether Ascyltos, when he\nTook you from me, pursu'd the injury that night, or was chastly\nContent to lye alone?\" The boy with his finger at his eyes, took a\nSolemn oath, that he had no incivility offer'd him by Ascyltos\n\nThis drove me to my wits end, nor did I well know what to say: For\nWhy, I consider'd, shou'd I think of the twice mischievous accident\nThat lately befell me? At last, I did what I cou'd to recover my\nVigour: and willing to invoke the assistance of the gods, I went out\nTo pay my devotions to Priapus, and as wretched as I was, did not\nDespair, but kneeling at the entry of the chamber, thus beseecht the\nGod:\n\n\"Bacchus and Nymphs delight, O mighty God!\nWhom Cynthia gave to rule the blooming wood\nLesbos and verdant Thasos thee adore\nAnd Lydians, in loose flowing dress implore\nAnd raise devoted temples to thy power\nThou Dryad's joy, and Bacchus's guardian, hear\nMy conscious prayer, with an attentive ear\nMy hands with guiltless blood I never stain'd\nOr sacrilegiously the gods prophan'd\nTo feeble me, restoring blessings send\nI did not thee, with my whole self offend\nWho sins thro' weakness is less guilty thought\nBe pacify'd, and spare a venial fault\nOn me, when smiling fate shall smiling gifts bestow\nI'll not ungrateful to thy godhead go\nA destin'd goat shall on thy altar lye\nAnd the horn'd parent of my flock shall dye\nA sucking pig appease thy injur'd shrine\nAnd hallow'd bowls o're-flow with generous wine\nThen thrice thy frantick votaries shall round\nThy temple dance, with youth and garlands crown'd\nIn holy drunkenness thy orgies sound.\"\n\nWhile I was thus at prayers, an old woman, with her hair about her\nEyes, and disfigur'd with a mournful habit, coming in, disturb'd my\nDevotions; when taking hold of me, she drew all fear out of the entry;\nAnd \"what hag,\" said she, \"has devour'd your manhood? Or what ominous\nCarcase have you stumbl'd over in your nightly walks? You have not\nAcquitted your self above a boy; but faint, weak, and like a horse\nO'recharg'd in a steep, tyr'd have lost your toyl and sweat; nor\nContent to sin alone, but have unreveng'd against me, provokt the\nOffended gods?\"\n\nWhen leading me, obedient to all her commands, a second time to the\nCell of a neighbouring priestess of Priapus, she threw me upon the\nBed, and taking up a stick that fastened the door, reveng'd her self\nOn me, that very patiently receiv'd her fury: and at the first stroak\nIf the breaking of the stick had not lessned its force, she might have\nBroke my head and arm\n\nI groan'd, and hiding with my arm my head, in a flood of tears lean'd\nOn the pillow: Nor did she then, less troubled, sit on the bed, and\nBegan in a shrill voice, to blame her age, till the priestess came in\nUpon us; and \"what,\" said she, \"do you do in my chappel, as if some\nFuneral had lately been, rather than a holy-day, in which, even the\nMournful are merry?\"\n\n\"Alas, my Enothea!\" said she, \"this youth was born under an ill star;\nFor neither boy nor maid can raise him to a perfect appetite; you\nNe're beheld a more unhappy man: In his garden the weak willow, not\nThe lusty cedar grows; in short, you may guess what he is, that cou'd\nRise unblest from Circe's bed.\"\n\nUpon this, Enothea fixt her self between us, and moving her head a\nWhile; \"I,\" said she, \"am the only one that can give remedy for that\nDisease; and not to delay it, let him sleep with me to night; and next\nMorning, examine how vigorous I shall have made him\n\n\"'All Nature's works my magick powers obey\nThe blooming earth shall wither and decay\nAnd when I please, agen be fresh and gay\nFrom rugged rocks, I make sweet waters flow\nAnd raging billows to me humbly bow\nWith rivers, winds, when I command, obey\nAnd at my feet, their fans contracted lay\nTygers and dragons too, my will obey\nBut these are small, when of my magick verse\nDescending Cynthia does the power confess\nWhen my commands, make trembling Ph\u00c5\u201cbus reign\nHis fiery steeds, their journey back again\nSuch power have charms, by whose prevailing aid\nThe fury of the raging bulls was laid\nThe Heaven-born Circe, with her magic song\nUlysses's men, did into monsters turn\nProteus, with this assum'd, what shape he wou'd\nI, who this art so long have understood\nCan send proud Ida's top into the main\nAnd make the billows bear it up again.'\"\n\nI shook with fear at such a romantick promise, and began more\nIntensively to view the old woman: Upon which, she cry'd out, \"O\nEnothea, be as good as your word\"; when, carefully wiping her hands\nShe lay down on the bed, and half smother'd me with kisses\n\nEnothea, in the middle of the altar, plac'd a turf-table, which she\nHeapt with burning coals, and her old crack cup (for sacrifice)\nRepair'd with temper'd pitch; when she had fixt it to the\nSmoaking-wall from which she took it; putting on her habit, she plac'd\nA kettle by the fire, and took down a bag that hung near her, in\nWhich, a bean was kept for that use, and a very aged piece of a hog's\nForehead, with the print of a hundred cuts out; when opening the bag\nShe threw me a part of the bean, and bid me carefully strip it. I\nObey her command, and try, without daubing my fingers, to deliver the\nGrain from its nasty coverings; but she, blaming my dullness, snatcht\nIt from me, and skilfully tearing its shells with her teeth, spit the\nBlack morsels from her, that lay like dead flies on the ground. How\nIngenious is poverty, and what strange arts will hunger teach? The\nPriestess seem'd so great a lover of this sort of life, that her\nHumour appear'd in every thing about her, and her hut might be truly\nTerm'd, sacred to poverty\n\nHere shines no glittering ivory set with gold\nNo marble covers the deluded mold\nBy its own wealth deluded; but the shrine\nWith simple natural ornaments does shine\nRound Cere's bower, but homely willows grow\nEarthen are all the sacred bowls they know\nOsier the dish, sacred to use divine:\nBoth course and stain'd, the jug that holds the wine\nMud mixt with straw, make a defending fort\nThe temple's brazen studs, are knobs of dirt\nWith rush and reed, is thatcht the hut it self\nWhere, besides what is on a smoaky shelf\nRipe service-berries into garlands bound\nAnd savory-bunches with dry'd grapes are found\nSuch a low cottage Hecale confin'd\nLow was her cottage, but sublime her mind\nHer bounteous heart, a grateful praise shall crown\nAnd muses make immortal her renown\n\nAfter which, she tasted of the flesh, and hanging the rest, old as her\nSelf, on the hook again; the rotten stool on which she was mounted\nBreaking, threw her into the fire, her fall spilt the kettle, and what\nIt held put out the fire; she burnt her elbow, and all her face was\nHid with the ashes that her fall had rais'd\n\nThus disturb'd, I arose, and laughing, took her up; immediately, lest\nAny thing shou'd hinder the offering, she ran for new fire to the\nNeighbourhood, and had hardly got to the door, e're I was set upon by\nThree sacred geese, that daily, I believe, about that time were fed by\nThe old woman; they made an hideous noise, and, surrounding me, one\nTears my coat, another my shoes, while their furious captain made\nNothing of doing so by my legs; till seeing my self in danger, I began\nTo be in earnest, and snatching up one of the feet of our little\nTable, made the valiant animal feel my arm'd hand; nor content with a\nSlight blow or two, but reveng'd my self with its death\n\nSuch were the birds Alcides did subdue\nThat from his conquering arm t'ward Heaven flew:\nSuch sure the harpyes were which poyson strow'd\nOn cheated Phineus's false deluding food\nLoud lamentations shake the trembling air\nThe powers above the wild confusion share\nHorrours disturb the orders of the sky\nAnd frighted stars beyond their courses fly\n\nBy this time the other two had eat up the pieces of the bean that lay\nScatter'd on the floor, and having lost their leader, return'd to the\nTemple. When glad of the booty and my revenge, I heal'd the slight\nOld woman's anger, I design'd to make off; and taking up my cloaths\nBegan my march; nor had I reacht the door, e're I saw Enothea bringing\nIn her hand an earthen pot fill'd with fire; upon which I retreated\nAnd throwing down my cloaths, fixt my self in the entry, as if I were\nImpatiently expecting her coming\n\nEnothea, entring, plac'd the fire, that with broken sticks she had got\nTogether, and having heapt more wood upon those, began to excuse her\nStay, that her friend wou'd not let her go before she had, against the\nLaws of drinking, taken off three healths together. When looking\nAbout her, \"What,\" said she, \"have you been doing in my absence?\nWhere's the bean?\"\n\nI, who thought I had behav'd my self very honourably, told her the\nWhole fight; and to end her grief for the loss of her bean, presented\nThe goose: when I shew'd the goose, the old woman set up such an\nOut-cry, that you wou'd have thought the geese were re-entring the\nPlace\n\nIn confusion and amaz'd at so strange a humour, I askt the meaning of\nHer passion? or why she pity'd the goose rather than me\n\nBut wringing her hands, \"you wicked wretch,\" said she, \"d'ye speak\nToo? D'ye know what you've done? You've killed the gods delight, a\nGoose the pleasure of all matrons: And, lest you shou'd think your\nSelf innocent, if a magistrate shou'd hear of it, you'd be hang'd\nYou have defil'd with blood my cell, that to this day had been\nInviolate. You have done that, for which, if any's so malicious, he\nMay expel me my office.\"\n\nShe said, and trembling, rends her aged hairs\nAnd both her cheeks with wilder fury tears:\nSad murmurs from her troubl'd breast arise\nA shower of tears there issu'd from her eyes\nAnd down her face a rapid deluge run\nSuch as is seen, when a hills frosty crown\nBy warm Favonius is melted down\n\nUpon which, \"I beseech you,\" said I, \"don't grieve, I'll recompence\nThe loss of your goose with an ostrich.\"\n\nWhile amaz'd I spoke, she sat down on the bed, lamented her loss; at\nWhat time Proselenos came in with the sacrifice, and viewing the\nMurder'd goose, and enquiring the cause, began very earnestly to cry\nAnd pity me, as it had been a father, not a goose I had slain. But\nTired with this stuff, \"I beseech ye,\" said I, \"tell me, tho' it had\nBeen a man I kill'd, won't gold wipe off the guilt? See here are two\nPieces of gold: with these you may purchase gods as well as geese.\"\n\nWhich, when Enothea beheld, \"Pardon me, young man,\" said she, \"I am\nOnly concern'd for your safety, which is an argument of love, not\nHatred; therefore we'll take what care we can to prevent a discovery:\nYou have nothing to do, but intreat the gods to forgive the sin.\"\n\n\"Who e're has money may securely sail\nOn all things with all-mighty gold prevail\nMay Danae wed, or rival amo'rous Jove\nAnd make her father pandar to his love\nMay be a poet, preacher, lawyer too:\nAnd bawling win the cause he does not know:\nAnd up to Cato's fame for wisdom grow\nWealth without law will gain at bar renown\nHow e're the case appears, the cause is won\nEvery rich lawyer is a Littleton\nIn short of all you wish you are possest\nAll things prevent the wealthy man's request\nFor Jove himself's the treasure of his chest.\"\n\nWhile my thoughts were thus engag'd, she plac'd a cup of wine under my\nHands, and having cleans'd my prophane extended fingers with sacred\nLeeks and parsley, threw into the wine, with some ejaculation\nHazel-nuts, and as they sunk or swam gave her judgment; but I well\nKnew the empty rotten ones wou'd swim, and those of entire kernels go\nTo the bottom\n\nWhen applying herself to the goose, from its breast she drew a lusty\nLiver, and then told me my future fortune. But that no mark of the\nMurder might be left, she fixt the rent goose to a spit, which, as she\nSaid, she had fatten'd a little before, as sensible it was to die\n\nIn the mean time the wine went briskly round, and now the old women\nGladly devour the goose, they so lately lamented; when they had pickt\nIts bones, Enothea, half drunk, turn'd to me; \"and now,\" said she\n\"I'll finish the charm that recovers your strength\": When drawing out\nA leathern ensign of Priapus, she dipt it in a medley of oyl, small\nPepper, and the bruis'd seed of nettles, paulatim coepit inserere ano\nMeo. Hoc crudelissima anus spurgit subinde umore femina mea\nNasturcii sucum cum abrotano miscet perfusisque inguinibus meis\nViridis urticae fascem comprehendit, omniaque infra umbilicum coepit\nLenta mann caedere. Upon which jumping from her, to avoid the sting\nI made off. The old woman in a great rage pursu'd me, and tho' drunk\nWith wine, and their more hot desires, took the right way: and\nFollow'd me through two or three villages, crying stop thief; but with\nMy hands all bloody, in the hasty flight, I got off\n\nWhen I got home, to ease my wearied limbs, I went to bed, but the\nThoughts of my misfortunes would not let me sleep; when considering\nHow unparallel'd a wretch I was, I cry'd out, \"Did my ever cruel\nFortune want the afflictions of love to make me more miserable? O\nUnhappiness! Fortune and love conspire my ruin. Severer love spares\nMe no way, or loving, or belov'd a wretch: Chrysis adores me, and is\nEver giving me occasion to address: She, that when she brought me to\nHer mistress, despis'd me for my mean habit as one beneath her\nDesires; that very Chrysis that so scorn'd my former fortune, pursues\nThis even with the hazard of her own; and swore, when she first\nDiscover'd to me the violence of her love, that she wou'd be ever true\nTo me. But Circe's in possession of my heart, I value none but her\nAnd indeed who wears such charms? Compar'd to her, what was Ariadne\nOr Lyda? what Helen, or even Venus? Paris himself the umpire of the\nWanton nymphs, if with these eyes he had seen her contending for the\nGolden apple, wou'd have given both his Helen and the goddesses for\nHer. If I might be admitted to kiss her sweet lips again, or once\nMore press her divinely rising breasts, perhaps my vigour wou'd\nRevive, which now I believe lyes opprest by witchcraft. I shou'd\nDispense with my reproaches, shou'd forget that I was beat; esteem my\nBeing turn'd out of doors, a sport; so I might be again happy in her\nFavours.\"\n\nThese thoughts and the image of the beautiful Circe so rais'd my mind\nThat I oft, as if my love was in my arms, with a great deal of\nFruitless ardour, hug'd the bed-cloaths, till out of patience with the\nLasting affliction I began to reproach my impotence; yet recovering my\nPresence of mind, I flew for comfort to the misfortunes of ancient\nHero's, and thus broke out:\n\n\"Not only me th' avenging gods pursue\nOft they their anger on their hero's throw;\nBy Juno's rage Alcides Heaven bore\nAnd Pelia's injur'd Juno knew before\nLeomedon Heaven's dire resentments felt\nAnd Telephus's blood washt out his guilt\nWe cannot from the wrathful godhead run\nCrafty Ulysses cou'd not Neptune shun\nProvokt Priapus o're the land and sea\nHas left his Hellespont to follow me.\"\n\nFull of anxious cares I spent the night: and Gito, inform'd that I lay\nAt home, enter'd my chamber by day-break, when having passionately\nComplain'd of my loose life, he told me the family took much notice of\nMy behaviour, that I was seldom in waiting, and that perhaps the\nCompany I kept wou'd be my ruin\n\nBy this I understood he was inform'd of my affairs; and that some one\nHad been in pursuit of me; upon which I ask't my Gito whether any body\nWas to enquire for me. \"Not this day,\" said he, \"but yesterday there\nCame a very pretty woman, who, when she had tir'd me with a long\nSifting discourse; at last told me you deserv'd to be punisht, and\nShou'd as a slave, if you longer complain'd.\"\n\nThis so sensibly touch'd me, that I began afresh to reproach fortune:\nNor had I done, e're Chrysis came in, and wildly throwing her arms\nAbout me: \"Now,\" said she, \"I'll hold my wish, you're my love, my joy;\nNor may you think to quench this flame, but by a more close embrace.\"\n\nI was much disturb'd at Chrysis's wantonness, and gave her fair\nLanguage, to get rid of her; for I was very apprehensive of the danger\nOf Eumolpus's hearing it, since his good fortune had made him so\nProud. I did therefore what I could to appease her rage; I dissembl'd\nLove, whisper'd soft things, and in short manag'd it so like a lover\nThat she believ'd me one. I made her understand in what danger we\nBoth were, if she shou'd be found with me in that place, and that our\nLord Eumolpus punisht the least offence. Upon which she immediately\nMade out, and the more hastily, because she saw Gito returning, who\nHad left me a little before she came\n\nShe was scarce out, when on a sudden one of the slaves came to me, and\nTold me that our lord so highly resented my two days absence, that\nUnless, as he advised me, I invented a good excuse to allay his heat\nI shou'd certainly be punish'd\n\nGito perceiving how concern'd I was, spoke not a word of the woman\nBut advis'd me to behave myself merrily to Eumolpus, rather than\nSerious. I pursu'd the counsel, and put on so pleasant a face that he\nReceiv'd me in drollery, without the grave stiffness of a master. He\nWas pleasant on the success of my amours; prais'd my meen and wit that\nWas so agreeable to the ladies: and \"I'm no stranger,\" said he, \"to\nYour love of a very beautiful lady. But now, Encolpius, that rightly\nManag'd, may turn to our advantage; therefore do you personate the\nLover, I'll continue the character I've begun.\"\n\nMatrona inter primas honesta, Philomela nomine quae multas saepe\nHereditates officio aetati extorserat, tum anus et floris extincti\nFilium filiamque ingerebat orbis senibus, et per hanc successionem\nArtem suam perseverabat extendere. Ea ergo ad Eumolpum venit et\nCommendare liberos suos eius prudentiae bonitatique . . . credere se\nEt vota sua. Illum esse solum in toto orbe terrarum, qui praeceptis\nEtiam salubribus instruere iuvenes quotidie posset. Ad summam\nRelinquere se pueros in domo Eumolpi, ut illum loquentem audirent:\nQuae sola posset hereditas iuvenibus dari. Nec aliter fecit ac\nDixerat, filiamque speciosissimam cum fratre ephebo in cubiculo\nReliquit simulavitque se in templum ire ad vota nuncupanda. Eumolpus\nQui tam frugi erat ut illi etiam ego puer viderer, non distulit\nPuellam invitare ad pigiciaca sacra. Sed et podagricum se esse\nLumborumque solutorum omnibus dixerat, et si non servasset integram\nSimulationem, periclitabatur totam paene tragoediam evertere. Itaque\nUt constaret mendacio fides, puellam quidem exoravit, ut sederet super\nCommendatam bonitatem, Coraci autem imperavit ut lectum, in quo ipse\nIacebat, subiret positisque in pavimento manibus dominum lumbis suis\nCommoveret. Ille lente parebat imperio puellaque artificium pari motu\nRemunerabat. Cum ergo res ad affectum spectaret, clara Eumolpus voce\nExhortabatur Coraca, ut spissaret officium. Sic inter mercennarium\nAmicamque positus senex veluti oscillatione ludebat. Hoc semel\nIterumque ingenti risu, etiam suo, Eumolpus fecerat. Itaque ego\nQuoque, ne desidia consuetudinem perderem, dum frater sororis suae\nAutomata per clostellum miratur, accessi temptaturus, an pateretur\nIniuriam. Nec se reiciebat a blanditiis doctissimus puer, sed me\nNumen inimicum ibi quoque invenit\n\nI was not so concern'd at this as the former; for a little after my\nStrength return'd, and finding my self more vigorous, I cry'd out, the\nCourteous gods are greater that have made me whole again. For\nMercury, that conveys and reconveys our souls, by his favours has\nRestor'd what his anger had seiz'd: Now I shall be in as great esteem\nAs Protesilaus or any of the antients. Upon which taking up my\nCloaths, I shew'd my whole self to Eumolpus, he startl'd at first, but\nSoon, to confirm his belief, with both hands chaf'd the mighty favour\nOf the gods\n\nThis great blessing makes us merry, we laughed at Philumene's cunning\nAnd her childrens experience in the art, which wou'd profit 'em little\nWith us; for to no other end were they left, but to be heirs to what\nWe had. When reflecting on this sordid manner of deceiving childless\nAge, I took occasion to consider the condition of our present fortune\nAnd told Eumolpus that the deceivers might be deceiv'd, that therefore\nAll our actions shou'd be of a piece with the character we bore\n\"That Socrates, the wisest of men, us'd to boast he never saw a\nTavern, nor ever had been in the common company that frequents such\nPlaces. That nothing was more convenient than a discreet behaviour\nAll these are truths, nor shou'd any sort of men,\" added I, \"more\nExpect the sudden assaults of ill fortune, than those that covet\nWhat's other men's. But how should pick-pockets live, unless, by some\nWell order'd trick, to draw fools together, they get imployment? As\nFish are taken with what they really eat, so men are to be cheated\nWith something that's solid, not empty hope; thus the people of this\nCountry have hitherto receiv'd us very nobly: but when they find the\nArrival of no ship from Africk, laden, as you told 'em, with riches\nAnd your retinue, the impatient deceivers, will lessen their bounty;\nTherefore, or I'm mistaken, our fortune begins to repent her favours.\"\n\n\"I have thought of a means,\" said Eumolpus, \"to make our deceivers\nContinue their care of us.\" And drawing his will out of his purse\nThus read the last lines of it\n\n\"All that have legacies in this my last will and testament, my freed\nMen excepted, receives 'em on these conditions, that they divide my\nBody, and eat it before the people. And that they may not think it an\nUnjust demand, let them know, that to this day 'tis the custom of many\nCountries, that the relations of the dead devour the carcase; and for\nThat reason they often quarrel with their sick kindred, because they\nSpoil their flesh by lingering in a disease. I only instance this to\nMy friends, that they may not refuse to perform my will; but with the\nSame sincerity they wisht well to my soul, they might devour my body.\"\n\nWhen he had read the chief articles, some that were more intimately\nAcquainted with him, enter'd the chamber, and viewing the will\nEarnestly intreated him to impart the contents of it; he readily\nConsented and read the whole. But when they heard the necessity of\nEating the carcass, they seem'd much concern'd at the strange\nProposal; but their insatiate love of the money made 'em stifle their\nPassion, and his person was so awful to 'em, they durst not complain\nBut one of 'em, Gorgias by name, briskly told him he was willing to\nAccept the conditions, so he might not wait for the body\n\nTo this Eumolpus, \"I'm not in the least apprehensive of your\nPerformance, nor that your stomach wou'd refuse the task, when to\nRecompense one distasteful minute you promise ages of luxury. 'Tis\nBut shutting your eyes, and supposing instead of man's flesh you were\nEating an hundred sesterces. Some sauce may be added to vary the\nTast; for no flesh pleases alone, but is prepar'd by art to commend it\nTo the stomach. If you desire instances of this kind, to make ye\nApprove my advice; the Saguntines when they were besieg'd by Hannibal\nEat humane bodies, without the hopes of an estate for doing it. The\nPetavii reduc'd to the last extremity did the like; nor had they\nFurther hopes in this banquet than to satisfie nature. When Scipio\nTook Numanita, mothers were found with their children half eaten in\nTheir arms. But since the thoughts only of eating man's flesh create\nThe lothing; 'tis but resolving, and you gain the mighty legacies I\nLeave you.\"\n\nEumolpus recounted these shameless inhumanities with so much\nConfusion, that his parasites began to suspect him, and more nearly\nConsidering our words and actions, their jealousie encreas'd with\nTheir observation, and they believ'd us perfect cheats. Upon which\nThose who had receiv't us most nobly, resolv'd to seize us, and lustly\nTake their revenge; but Chrysis, privy to all stratagems, gave me\nNotice of their designs; the frightful news so struck me, that I made\nOff with Gito immediately, and left Eumolpus to the mercy of his\nEnemies; and in a few days we heard the Crotonians raging, that that\nOld rascal shou'd live so long at such a sumptuous rate on the publick\nCharge, sacrific'd him the Massilian way. Whenever the Massilians\nWere visited with a plague, some one of the poorest of the people, for\nThe sake of being well fed a whole year at the publick charge, wou'd\nOffer himself a sacrifice to appease the gods: He after his year was\nUp, drest in holy wreath and sacred garment, was led about the city\nWith invocations on the gods that all the sins of the nation might be\nPunisht in him; and

But he was given to travelling everywhere and loved to fare over wild and wold, waterless lowland and stony waste, and to journey to the isles of the seas, in quest of dirhams and dinars: wherefore he had in his time encountered dangers and suffered duresse of the way such as would grizzle little children and turn their black hair grey. He was possessed of black slaves and Mamelukes, eunuchs and concubines, and was the wealthiest of the merchants of his time and the goodliest of them in speech, owning horses and mules and Bactrian camels and dromedaries; sacks great and small of size; goods and merchandise and stuffs such as muslins of Hums, silks and brocades of Ba'allak, cotton of Mery, stuffs of India, gauzes of Baghdad, burnouses of Moorland and Turkish white slaves and Abyssinian castratos and Grecian girls and Egyptian boys; and the coverings of his bales were silk with gold purfled fair, for he was wealthy beyond compare. Furthermore he was rare of comeliness, accomplished in goodliness, and gracious in his kindliness, even as one of his describers doth thus express,\n\n\"A merchant I spied whose lovers * Were fighting in furious\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    guise:\nQuoth he, 'Why this turmoil of people?' * Quoth I, 'Trader, for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  those fine eyes!'\"\nAnd saith another in his praise and saith well enough to accomplish the wish of him,\n\n\"Came a merchant to pay us a visit * Whose glance did my heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    surprise:\nQuoth he, 'What surprised thee so?' * Quoth I, 'Trader, 'twas\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    those fine eyes.'\"\n\nNow that merchant had a son called Ali Nur al-Din, as he were the full moon whenas it meeteth the sight on its fourteenth night, a marvel of beauty and loveliness, a model of form and symmetrical grace, who was sitting one day as was his wont, in his father's shop, selling and buying, giving and taking, when the sons of the merchants girt him around and he was amongst them as moon among stars, with brow flower-white and cheeks of rosy light in down the tenderest dight, and body like alabaster-bright even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"'Describe me!' a fair one said. * Said I, 'Thou art Beauty's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    queen.'\nAnd, speaking briefest speech, * 'All charms in thee are seen.'\"\nAnd as saith of him one of his describers,\n\n\"His mole upon plain of cheek is like * Ambergr\u00eds-crumb on marble\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    plate,\nAnd his glances likest the sword proclaim * To all Love's rebels\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'The Lord is Great!'\"[FN#378]\n\nThe young merchants invited him saying, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, we wish thee to go this day a-pleasuring with us in such a garden.\" And he answered, \"Wait till I consult my parent, for I cannot go without his consent.\" As they were talking, behold, up came Taj al-Din, and his son looked at him and said, \"O father mine, the sons of the merchants have invited me to wend a-pleasuring with them in such a garden. Dost thou grant me leave to go?\" His father replied, \"Yes, O my son, fare with them;\" and gave him somewhat of money. So the young men mounted their mules and asses and Nur al-Din mounted a she-mule and rode with them to a garden, wherein was all that sould desireth and that eye charmeth. It was high of walls which from broad base were seen to rise; and it had a gateway vault-wise with a portico like a saloon and a door azure as the skies, as it were one of the gates of Paradise: the name of the door-keeper was Rizw\u00e1n,[FN#379] and over the gate were trained an hundred trellises which grapes overran; and these were of various dyes, the red like coralline, the black like the snouts of S\u00fad\u00e1n[FN#380]-men and the white like egg of the pigeon-hen.

So, the tray being sat before them, they fell to and ate their fill; and when they had made an end of eating, they rose from meat and washed their hands with pure water and musk-scented soap, and dried them with napery embroidered in silk and bugles; but to Nur al-Din they brought a napkin laced with red gold whereon he wiped his hands. Then coffee[FN#412] was served up and each drank what he would, after which they sat talking, till presently the garden-keeper who was young went away and returning with a basket full of roses, said to them, \"What say ye, O my masters, to flowers?\" Quoth one of them, \"There is no harm in them,[FN#413] especially roses, which are not to be resisted.\" Answered the gardener, \"'Tis well, but it is of our wont not to give roses but in exchange for pleasant converse;

but he said, \"This thing I wot it not nor have I ever drunken thereof, for therein is great offence and the Lord of All-might hath forbidden it in His Book.\" Answered the gardener, \"O my Lord Nur al-Din, an thou forbear to drink only by reason of the sin, verily Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) is bountiful, of sufferance great, forgiving and compassionate and pardoneth the mortalest sins: His mercy embraceth all things, Allah's ruth be upon the poet who saith,\n\n'Be as thou, wilt, for Allah is bountiful * And when thou sinnest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  feel thou naught alarm:\nBut 'ware of twofold sins nor ever dare * To give God partner or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  mankind to harm.'\"\n\nThen quoth one of the sons of the merchants, \"My life on thee, O my lord Nur al-Din, drink of this cup!\" And another conjured him by the oath of divorce and yet another stood up persistently before him, till he was ashamed and taking the cup from the gardener, drank a draught, but spat it out again, crying, \"'Tis bitter.\" Said the young gardener, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, knowest thou not that sweets taken by way of medicine are bitter? Were this not bitter, 'twould lack of the manifold virtues it possesseth; amongst which are that it digesteth food and disperseth cark and care and dispelleth flatulence and clarifieth the blood and cleareth the complexion and quickeneth the body and hearteneth the hen-hearted and fortifieth the sexual power in man; but to name all its virtues would be tedious. Quoth one of the poets,\n\n'We'll drink and Allah pardon sinners all * And cure of ills by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  sucking cups I'll find:\nNor aught the sin deceives me; yet said He * 'In it there be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 advantage[FN#419] to mankind.'\"\n\nThen he sprang up without stay or delay and opened one of the cupboards in the pavilion and taking out a loaf of refined sugar, broke off a great slice which he put into Nur al-Din's cup, saying, \"O my lord, an thou fear to drink wine, because of its bitterness, drink now, for 'tis sweet.\" So he took the cup and emptied it: whereupon one of his comrades filled him another, saying, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, I am thy slave,\" and another did the like, saying, \"I am one of thy servants,\" and a third said, \"For my sake!\" and a fourth, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord Nur al-Din, heal my heart!\" And so they ceased not plying him with wine, each and every of the ten sons of merchants till they had made him drink a total of ten cups. Now Nur al-Din's body was virgin of wine-bibbing, or never in all his life had he drunken vine-juice till that hour, wherefore its fumes wrought in his brain and drunkenness was stark upon him and he stood up (and indeed his tongue was thick and his speech stammering) and said, \"O company, by Allah, ye are fair and your speech is goodly and your place pleasant; but there needeth hearing of sweet music; for drink without melody lacks the chief of its essentiality, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Pass round the cup to the old and the young man, too, And take\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   the bowl from the hand of the shining moon,[FN#420]\nBut without music, I charge you, forbear to drink; I see even\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 horses drink to a whistled tune.'\"[FN#421]\n\nTherewith up sprang the gardener lad and mounting one of the young men's mules, was absent awhile, after which he returned with a Cairene girl, as she were a sheep's tail, fat and delicate, or an ingot of pure silvern ore or a dinar on a porcelain plate or a gazelle in the wold forlore. She had a face that put to shame the shining sun and eyes Babylonian[FN#422] and brows like bows bended and cheeks rose-painted and teeth pearly-hued and lips sugared and glances languishing and breast ivory white and body slender and slight, full of folds and with dimples dight and hips like pillows stuffed and thighs like columns of Syrian stone, and between them what was something like a sachet of spices in wrapper swathed. Quoth the poet of her in these couplets,\n\n\"Had she shown her shape to idolaters' sight, * They would gaze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   on her face and their gods detest:\nAnd if in the East to a monk she'd show'd, * He'd quit Eastern\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   posture and bow to West.[FN#423]\nAn she crached in the sea and the briniest sea * Her lips would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   give it the sweetest zest.\"\nAnd quoth another in these couplets,\n\n\"Brighter than Moon at full with kohl'd eyes she came * Like Doe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    on chasing whelps of Lioness intent:\nHer night of murky locks lets fall a tent on her * A tent of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hair[FN#424] that lacks no pegs to hold the tent;\nAnd roses lighting up her roseate cheeks are fed * By hearts and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    livers flowing fire for languishment:\nAn 'spied her all the Age's Fair to her they'd rise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Humbly,[FN#425] and cry 'The meed belongs to precedent!'\"\nAnd how well saith a third bard,[FN#426]\n\n\"Three things for ever hinder her to visit us, for fear Of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   intriguing spy and eke the rancorous envier;\nHer forehead's lustre and the sound of all her ornaments And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  sweet scent her creases hold of ambergris and myrth.\nGrant with the border of her sleeve she hide her brow and doff\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Her ornaments, how shall she do her scent away from her?\"\n\nShe was like the moon when at fullest on its fourteenth night, and was clad in a garment of blue, with a veil of green, overbrown flower-white that all wits amazed and those of understanding amated.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying his permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the gardener brought a girl whom we have described, possessed of the utmost beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetrical grace as it were she the poet signified when he said,[FN#427]\n\n\"She came apparelled in a vest of blue,\nThat mocked the skies and shamed their azure hue;\nI thought thus clad she burst upon my sight,\nLike summer moonshine on a wintry night.\"\n\nAnd how goodly is the saying of another and how excellent,\n\n\"She came thick veiled, and cried I, 'O display * That face like\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   full moon bright with pure-white ray.'\nQuoth she, 'I fear disgrace,' quoth I, 'Cut short * This talk, no\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   shift of days thy thoughts affray.'\nWhereat she raised her veil from fairest face * And crystal spray\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   on gems began to stray:\nAnd I forsooth was fain to kiss her cheek, * Lest she complain of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me on Judgment-Day.\nAnd at such tide before the Lord on High * We first of lovers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   were redress to pray:\nSo 'Lord, prolong this reckoning and review' * (Prayed I) 'that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    longer I may sight my may.'\"\n\nThen said the young gardener to her, \"Know thou, O lady of the fair, brighter than any constellation which illumineth air we sought, in bringing thee hither naught but that thou shouldst entertain with converse this comely youth, my lord Nur al-Din, for he hath come to this place only this day.\" And the girl replied, \"Would thou hadst told me, that I might have brought what I have with me!\" Rejoined the gardener, \"O my lady, I will go and fetch it to thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" said she: and he, \"Give me a token.\" So she gave him a kerchief and he fared forth in haste and returned after awhile, bearing a green satin bag with slings of gold. The girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it, whereupon there fell thereout two-and-thirty pieces of wood, which she fitted one into other, male into female and female into male[FN#428] till they became a polished lute of Indian workmanship. Then she uncovered her wrists and laying the lute in her lap, bent over it with the bending of mother over babe, and swept the strings with her finger-tips; whereupon it moaned and resounded and after its olden home yearned; and it remembered the waters that gave it drink and the earth whence it sprang and wherein it grew and it minded the carpenters who made it their merchandise and the ships that shipped it; and it cried and called aloud and moaned and groaned; and it was as if she asked it of all these things and it answered her with the tongue of the case, reciting these couplets,[FN#429]\n\n\"A tree whilere was I the Bulbul's home * To whom for love I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bowed my grass-green head:\nThey moaned on me, and I their moaning learnt * And in that moan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   my secret all men read:\nThe woodman fell me falling sans offence, * And slender lute of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  me (as view ye) made:\nBut, when the fingers smite my strings, they tell * How man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   despite my patience did me dead;\nHence boon-companions when they hear my moan * Distracted wax as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   though by wine misled:\nAnd the Lord softens every heart of me, * And I am hurried to the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   highmost stead:\nAll who in charms excel fain clasp my waist; * Gazelles of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   languid eyne and Houri maid:\nAllah ne'er part fond lover from his joy * Nor live the loved one\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who unkindly fled.\"\n\nThen the girl was silent awhile, but presently taking the lute in lap, again bent over it, as mother bendeth over child, and preluded in many different modes; then, returning to the first, she sang these couplets,\n\n\"Would they [FN#430] the lover seek without ado, * He to his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heavy grief had bid adieu:\nWith him had vied the Nightingale[FN#431] on bough * As one far\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   parted from his lover's view:\nRouse thee! awake!

Then he kissed her on the mouth and played with her at kisses, after the manner of the billing of doves; and she met him with like warmth and did with him as she was done by till the others were distracted and rose to their feet; whereupon Nur al-Din was ashamed and held his hand from her.

So she pressed him to her bosom and fell to kissing him like the billing of doves, whilst he returned her caresses with successive kisses; but preeminence appertaineth to precedence.[FN#437] When she had made an end of kissing, she took the lute and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Alas, alack and well-away for blamer's calumny! * Whether or not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I make my moan or plead or show no plea:\nO spurner of my love I ne'er of thee so hard would deem * That I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of thee should be despised, of thee my property.\nI wont at lovers' love to rail and for their passion chide, * But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    now I fain debase myself to all who rail at thee:\nYea, only yesterday I wont all amourists to blame * But now I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pardon hearts that pine for passion's ecstasy;\nAnd of my stress of parting-stowre on me so heavy weighs * At\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   morning prayer to Him I'll cry, 'In thy name, O Ali!'\"\nAnd also these two couplets,\n\n\"His lovers said, 'Unless he deign to give us all a drink * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wine, of fine old wine his lips deal in their purity;\nWe to the Lord of Threefold Worlds will pray to grant our prayer'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * And all exclaim with single cry 'In thy name, O Ali!'\"\n\nNur al-Din, hearing these lines and their rhyme, marvelled at the fluency of her tongue and thanked her, praising her grace and passing seductiveness; and the damsel, delighted at his praise, arose without stay or delay and doffing that was upon her of outer dress and trinkets till she was free of all encumbrance sat down on his knees and kissed him between the eyes and on his cheek-mole. Then she gave him all she had put off.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the girl gave to Nur al-Din all she had doffed, saying, \"O beloved of my heart, in very sooth the gift is after the measure of the giver.\" So he accepted this from her and gave it back to her and kissed her on the mouth and cheeks and eyes. When this was ended and done, for naught is durable save the Living, the Eternal, Provider of the peacock and the owl,[FN#438] Nur al-Din rose from the s\u00e9ance and stood upon his feet, because the darkness was now fallen and the stars shone out; whereupon quoth the damsel to him, \"Whither away, O my lord?\"; and quoth he, \"To my father's home.\" Then the sons of the merchants conjured him to night with them, but he refused and mounting his shemule, rode, without stopping, till he reached his parent's house, where his mother met him and said to him, \"O my son, what hath kept thee away till this hour? By Allah, thou hast troubled myself and thy sire by thine absence from us, and our hearts have been occupied with thee.\" Then she came up to him, to kiss him on his mouth, and smelling the fumes of the wine, said, \"O my wine-bibber and a rebel against Him to whom belong creation and commandment?\" But Nur al-Din threw himself down on the bed and lay there. Presently in came his sire and said, \"What aileth Nur al-Din to lie thus?\"; and his mother answered, \"'Twould seem his head acheth for the air of the garden.\" So Taj al-Din went up to his son, to ask him of his ailment, and salute him, and smelt the reek of wine.[FN#439] Now the merchant loved not wine-drinkers; so he said to Nur al-Din, \"Woe to thee, O my son! Is folly come to such a pass with thee, that thou drinkest wine?\" When Nur al-Din heard his sire say this, he raised his hand, being yet in his drunkenness, and dealt him a buffet, when by decree of the Decreer the blow lit on his father's right eye which rolled down on his cheek; whereupon he fell a-swoon and lay therein awhile. They sprinkled rose-water on him till he recovered, when he would have beaten his son; but the mother withheld him, and he swore, by the oath of divorce from his wife that, as soon as morning morrowed, he would assuredly cut off his son's right hand.[FN#440] When she heard her husband's words, her breast was straitened and she feared for he son and ceased not to soothe and appease his sire, till sleep overcame him. Then she waited till moon-rise, when she went in to her son, whose drunkenness had now departed from him, and said to him, \"O Nur al-Din, what is this foul deed thou diddest with thy sire?\" He asked, \"And what did I with him?\"; and answered she, \"Thou dealtest him a buffet on the right eye and struckest it out so that it rolled down his cheek; and he hath sworn by the divorce-oath that, as soon as morning shall morrow he will without fail cut off thy right hand.\" Nur al-Din repented him of that he had done, whenas repentance profited him naught, and his mother sait to him, \"O my son, this penitence will not profit thee; nor will aught avail thee but that thou arise forthwith and seek safety in flight: go forth the house privily and take refuge with one of thy friends and there what Allah shall do await, for he changeth case after case and state upon state.\" Then she opened a chest and taking out a purse of an hundred dinars said, \"O my son, take these dinars and provide thy wants therewith, and when they are at an end, O my son, send and let me know thereof, that I may send thee other than these, and at the same time covey to me news of thyself privily: haply Allah will decree thee relief and thou shalt return to thy home. And she farewelled him and wept passing sore, nought could be more. Thereupon Nur al-Din took the purse of gold and was about to go forth, when he espied a great purse containing a thousand dinars, which his mother had forgotten by the side of the chest. So he took this also and binding the two purses about his middle,[FN#441] set out before dawn threading the streets in the direction of B\u00fal\u00e1k, where he arrived when day broke and all creatures arose, attesting the unity of Allah the Opener and went forth each of them upon his several business, to win that which Allah had unto him allotted. Reaching Bulak he walked on along the riverbank till he sighted a ship with her gangway out and her four anchors made fast to the land. The folk were going up into her and coming down from her, and Nur al-Din, seeing some sailors there standing, asked them whither they were bound, and they answered, \"To Rosetta-city.\" Quoth he, \"Take me with you;\" and quoth they, \"Well come, and welcome to thee, to thee, O goodly one!\" So he betook himself forthright to the market and buying what he needed of vivers and bedding and covering, returned to the port and went on board the ship, which was ready to sail and tarried with him but a little while before she weighed anchor and fared on, without stopping, till she reached Rosetta,[FN#442] where Nur al-Din saw a small boat going to Alexandria. So he embarked in it and traversing the sea-arm of Rosetta fared on till he came to a bridge called Al-J\u00e1m\u00ed, where he landed and entered Alexandria by the gate called the Gate of the Lote-tree. Allah protected him, so that none of those who stood on guard at the gate saw him, and he walked on till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventieth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Din entered Alexandria he found it a city goodly of pleasaunces, delightful to its inhabitants and inviting to inhabit therein. Winter had fared from it with his cold and Prime was come to it with his roses: its flowers were kindly ripe and welled forth its rills. Indeed, it was a city goodly of ordinance and disposition; its folk were of the best of men, and when the gates thereof were shut, its folk were safe.[FN#443] And it was even as is said of it in these couplets,\n\n\"Quoth I to a comrade one day, * A man of good speech and rare,\n'Describe Alexandria.' * Quoth he, 'Tis a march-town fair.'\nQuoth I, 'Is there living therein?' * And he, 'An the wind blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  there.'\"\nOr as saith one of the poets,\n\n\"Alexandria's a frontier;[FN#444] Whose dews of lips are sweet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and clear;\nHow fair the coming to it is, * So one therein no raven speer!\"\n\nNur al-Din walked about the city and ceased not walking till her came to the merchants' bazar, whence he passed on to the mart of the money-changers and so on in turn to the markets of the confectioners and fruiterers and druggists, marvelling, as he went, at the city, for that the nature of its qualities accorded with its name.[FN#445] As he walked in the druggists' bazar, behold, an old man came down from his shop and saluting him, took him by the hand and carried him to his home. And Nur al-Din saw a fair bystreet, swept and sprinkled, whereon the zephyr blew and made pleasantness pervade it and the leaves of the trees overshaded it. Therein stood three houses and at the upper end a mansion, whose foundations were firm sunk in the water and its walls towered to the confines of the sky. They had swept the space before it and they had sprinkled it freshly; so it exhaled the fragrance of flowers, borne on the zephyr which breathed upon the place; and the scent met there who approached it on such wise as it were one of the gardens of Paradise. And, as they had cleaned and cooed the by-street's head, so was the end of it with marble spread. The Shaykh carried Nur al-Din into the house and setting somewhat of food before him ate with his guest. When they had made an end of eating, the druggist said to him, \"When camest thou hither from Cairo?\"; and Nur al-Din replied, \"This very night, O my father.\" Quoth the old man, \"What is thy name?\"; and quoth he, \"Ali Nur al-Din.\" Said the druggist, \"O my son, O Nur al-Din, be the triple divorce incumbent on me, an thou leave me so long as thou abidest in this city; and I will set thee apart a place wherein thou mayst dwell.\" Nur al-Din asked, \"O my lord the Shaykh, let me know more of thee\"; and the other answered, \"Know, O my son, that some years ago I went to Cairo with merchandise, which I sold there and bought other, and I had occasion for a thousand dinars. So thy sire Taj al-Din weighed them out[FN#446] for me, all unknowing me, and would take no written word of me, but had patience with me till I returned hither and sent him the amount by one of my servants, together with a gift. I saw thee, whilst thou wast little; and, if it please Allah the Most High, I will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me.\" When Nur al-Din heard the old man's story, he showed joy and pulling out with a smile the purse of a thousand dinars, gave it to his host the Shaykh and said to him, \"Take charge of this deposit for me, against I buy me somewhat of merchandise whereon to trade.\" Then he abode some time in Alexandria city taking his pleasure every day in its thoroughfares, eating and drinking ad indulging himself with mirth and merriment till he had made an end of the hundred dinars he had kept by way of spending-money; whereupon he repaired to the old druggist, to take of him somewhat of the thousand dinars to spend, but found him not in his shop and took a seat therein to await his return. He sat there gazing right and left and amusing himself with watching the merchants and passers-by, and as he was thus engaged behold, there came into the bazar a Persian riding on a she-mule and carrying behind him a damsel; as she were argent of alloy free or a fish Balti[FN#447] in mimic sea or a doe-gazelle on desert lea. Her face outshone the sun in shine and she had witching eyne and breasts of ivory white, teeth of marguerite, slender waist and sides dimpled deep and calves like tails of fat sheep;[FN#448] and indeed she was perfect in beauty and loveliness, elegant stature and symmetrical grace, even as saith one, describing her,[FN#449]\n\n\"'Twas as by will of her she was create * Nor short nor long, but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Beauty's mould and mate:\nRose blushes reddest when she sees those cheeks * And fruits the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bough those marvel charms amate:\nMoon is her favour, Musk the scent of her * Branch is her shape:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  she passeth man's estate:\n'Tis e'en as were she cast in freshest pearl * And every limblet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shows a moon innate.\"\n\nPresently the Persian lighted down from his she-mule and, making the damsel also dismount, loudly summoned the broker and said to him as soon as he came, \"Take this damsel and cry her for sale in the market.\" So he took her and leading her to the middlemost of the bazar disappeared for a while and presently he returned with a stool of ebony, inlaid with ivory, and setting it upon the ground, seated her thereon. Then he raised her veil and discovered a face as it were a Median targe[FN#450] or a cluster of pearls:[FN#451] and indeed she was like the full moon, when it filleth on its fourteenth night, accomplished in brilliant beauty. As saith the poet,\n\n\"Vied the full moon for folly with her face, * But was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   eclipsed[FN#452] and split for rage full sore;\nAnd if the spiring B\u00e1n with her contend * Perish her hands who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  load of fuel bore!\"[FN#453]\nAnd how well saith another,\n\n\"Say to the fair in the wroughten veil * How hast made that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   monk-like worshipper ail?\nLight of veil and light of face under it * Made the hosts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  darkness to fly from bale;\nAnd, when came my glance to steal look at cheek. * With a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  meteor-shaft the Guard made me quail.\"[FN#454]\n\nThen said the broker to the merchants,[FN#455] \"How much do ye bid for the union-pearl of the diver and prize-quarry of the fowler?\" Quoth one, \"She is mine for an hundred dinars.\" And another said, \"Two hundred,\" and a third, \"Three hundred\"; and they ceased not to bid, one against other, till they made her price nine hundred and fifty dinars, and there the biddings stopped awaiting acceptance and consent.[FN#456]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchants bid one against other till they made the price of the girl nine hundred and fifty dinars. Then the broker went up to her Persian master and said to him, \"The biddings for this thy slavegirl have reached nine hundred and fifty dinars: so say me, wilt thou sell her at that price and take the money?\" Asked the Persian, \"Doth she consent to this? I desire to fall in with her wishes, for I sickened on my journey hither and this handmaid tended me with all possible tenderness, wherefore I sware not to sell her but to him whom she should like and approve, and I have put her sale in her own hand. So do thou consult her and if she say, 'I consent,' sell her to whom thou wilt: but an she say, 'No,' sell her not.\" So the broker went up to her and asked her, \"O Princess of fair ones, know that thy master putteth thy sale in thine own hands, and thy price hath reached nine hundred and fifty dinars; dost thou give me leave to sell thee?\" She answered, \"Show me him who is minded to buy me before clinching the bargain.\" So he brought her up to one of the merchants a man stricken with years and decrepit; and she looked at him a long while, then turned to the broker and said to him, \"O broker, art thou Jinn-mad or afflicted in thy wit?\" Replied he, \"Why dost thou ask me this, O Princess of fair ones?\"; and said she, \"Is it permitted thee of Allah to sell the like of me to yonder decrepit old man, who saith of his wife's case these couplets,\n\n'Quoth she to me,\u2014and sore enraged for wounded pride was she, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  For she in sooth had bidden me to that which might not be,\u2014\n'An if thou swive me not forthright, as one should swive his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wife, * Thou be made a cuckold straight, reproach it not to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me.\nMeseems thy yard is made of wax, for very flaccidness; * For when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I rub it with my hand, it softens instantly.'[FN#457]\nAnd said he likewise of his yard,\n\n'I have a yard that sleeps in base and shameful way * When grants\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   my lover boon for which I sue and pray:\nBut when I wake o' mornings[FN#458] all alone in bed, * 'Tis fain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  o' foin and fence and fierce for futter-play.'\nAnd again quoth he thereof of his yard,\n\n'I have a froward yard of temper ill * Dishonoring him who shows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  it most regard:\nIt stands when sleep I, when I stand it sleeps * Heaven pity not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who pitieth that yard!'\"\n\nWhen the old merchant heard this ill flouting from the damsel, he was wroth with wrath exceeding beyond which was no proceeding and said to the broker, \"O most ill-omened of brokers, thou hast not brought into the market this ill-conditioned wench but to gibe me and make mock of me before the merchants.\" Then the broker took her aside and said to her, \"O my lady, be not wanting in self-respect. The Shaykh at whom thou didst mock is the Syndic of the bazar and Inspector[FN#459] thereof and a committee-man of the council of the merchants.\" But she laughed and improvised these two couplets,\n\n\"It behoveth folk who rule in our time, * And 'tis one of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  duties of magistrateship,\nTo hand up the Wali above his door * And beat with a whip the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Mohtasib!\"\n\nAdding, \"By Allah, O my lord, I will not be sold to yonder old man; so sell me to other than him, for haply he will be abashed at me and vend me again and I shall become a mere servant[FN#460] and it beseemeth not that I sully myself with menial service; and indeed thou knowest that the matter of my sale is committed to myself.\" He replied, \"I hear and I obey,\" and carried her to a man which was one of the chief merchants. And when standing hard by him the broker asked, \"How sayst thou, O my lady? Shall I sell thee to my lord Shar\u00edf al-D\u00edn here for nine hundred and fifty gold pieces?\" She looked at him and, seeing him to be an old man with a dyed beard, said to the broker, \"Art thou silly, that thou wouldst sell me to this worn out Father Antic? Am I cotton refuse or threadbare rags that thou marchest me about from greybeard to greybeard, each like a wall ready to fall or an Ifrit smitten down of a fire-ball? As for the first, the poet had him in mind when he said,[FN#461]\n\n'I sought of a fair maid to kiss her lips of coral red, But, 'No,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   by Him who fashioned things from nothingness!' she said.\nUnto the white of hoary hairs I never had a mind, And shall my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mouth be stuffed, forsooth, with cotton, ere I'm dead?'\nAnd how goodly is the saying of the poet,\n\n'The wise have said that white of hair is light that shines and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    robes * The face of man with majesty and light that awes the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sight;\nYet until hoary seal shall stamp my parting-place of hair * I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hope and pray that same may be black as the blackest night.\nAlbe Time-whitened beard of man be like the book he bears[FN#462]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    * When to his Lord he must return, I'd rather 'twere not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    white,'\nAnd yet goodlier is the saying of another,\n\n'A guest hath stolen on my head and honour may he lack! * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     sword a milder deed hath done that dared these locks to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hack.\nAvaunt, O Whiteness,[FN#463] wherein naught of brightness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  gladdens sight * Thou 'rt blacker in the eyes of me than\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  very blackest black!'\n\nAs for the other, he is a model of wantonness and scurrilousness and a blackener of the face of hoariness; his dye acteth the foulest of lies: and the tongue of his case reciteth these lines,[FN#464]\n\n'Quoth she to me, 'I see thou dy'st thy hoariness;' and I, 'I do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    but hide it from thy sight, O thou mine ear and eye!'\nShe laughed out mockingly and said, 'A wonder 'tis indeed!

Quoth she, \"Trot him out that I may see him and question him of a certain thing, which if he have in his house, I will be sold to him; and if not, then not.\" So the broker left her standing there and going up to Shihab al-Din, said to him, \"O my lord, know that yonder damsel tells me she hath a mind to ask thee somewhat, which an thou have, she will be sold to thee. Now thou hast heard what she said to thy fellows, the merchants,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the broker said to the merchant, \"Thou hast heard what this handmaid said to thy fellows, the traders, and by Allah, I fear to bring her to thee, lest she do with thee like as she did with thy neighbours and so I fall into disgrace with thee: but, an thou bid me bring her to thee, I will bring her.\" Quoth the merchant, \"Hither with her to me.\" \"Hearing and obeying,\" answered the broker and fetched for the purchaser the damsel, who looked at him and said, \"O my lord, Shihab al-Din, hast thou in thy house round cushions stuffed with ermine strips?\" Replied Shihab al-Din, \"Yes, O Princess of fair ones, I have at home half a score such cushions; but I conjure thee by Allah, tell me, what will thou do with them?\" Quoth she, \"I will bear with thee till thou be asleep, when I will lay them on thy mouth and nose and press them down till thou die.\" Then she turned to the broker and said to him, \"O thou refuse of brokers, meseemeth thou art mad, in that thou showest me this hour past, first to a pair of greybeards, in each of whom are two faults, and then thou proferrest me to my lord Shihab al-Din wherein be three defects; and thirdly, he is dwarfish, secondly, he hath a nose which is big, and thirdly, he hath a beard which is long. Of him quoth one of the poets,\n\n'We never heard of wight nor yet espied * Who amid men three\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    gifts hath unified:\nTo wit, a beard one cubit long, a snout * Span-long and figure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    tall a finger wide:'\nAnd quoth another poet,\n\n'From the plain of his face springs a minaret * Like a bezel of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ring on his finger set:\nDid creation enter that vasty nose * No created thing would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    elsewhere be met.'\"\n\nWhen Shihab al-Din heard this, he came down from his shop and seized the broker by the collar, saying, \"O scurviest of brokers, what aileth thee to bring us a damsel to flout and make mock of us, one after other, with her verses and talk that a curse is?\" So the broker took her and carried her away from before him and fared, saying, \"By Allah, all my life long, since I have plied this profession never set I eyes on the like of thee for unmannerliness nor aught more curst to me than thy star, for thou hast cut off my livelihood this day and I have gained no profit by thee save cuffs on the neck-nape and catching by the collar!\" Then he brought her to the shop of another merchant, owner of negro slaves and white servants, and stationing her before him, said to her, \"Wilt thou be sold to this my lord 'Al\u00e1 al-D\u00edn?\" She looked at him and seeing him hump-backed, said, \"This is a Gobbo, and quoth the poet of him,\n\n'Drawn in thy shoulders are and spine thrust out, * As seeking\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  star which Satan gave the lout;[FN#466]\nOr as he tasted had first smack of scourge * And looked in marvel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  for a second bout.'\n\nAnd saith another on the same theme,\n\n'As one of you who mounted mule, * A sight for me to ridicule: Is 't not a farce?

This is a ram, whose tail hath sprouted from his gullet. Wilt thou sell me to him, O unluckiest of brokers? Hast thou not heard say: 'All long of beard are little of wits? Indeed, after the measure of the length of the beard is the lack of sense; and this is a well-known thing among men of understanding.' As saith one of the poets,\n\n'Ne'er was a man with beard grown overlong, * Tho' be he therefor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  reverenced and fear'd,\nBut who the shortness noted in his wits * Added to longness noted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  in his beard.'\nAnd quoth another,[FN#468]\n\n'I have a friend with a beard which God hath made to grow to a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  useless length,\nIt is like unto one of the nights of winter long and dark and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cold.'\"\n\nWith this the broker took her and turned away with her, and she asked, \"Whither goest thou with me?\" He answered, \"Back to thy master the Persian; it sufficeth me what hath befallen me because of thee this day; for thou hast been the means of spoiling both my trade and his by thine ill manners.\" Then she looked about the market right and left, front and rear till, by the decree of the Decreer her eyes fell on Ali Nur al-Din the Cairene. So she gazed at him and saw him[FN#469] to be a comely youth of straight slim form and smooth of face, fourteen years old, rare in beauty and loveliness and elegance and amorous grace like the full moon on the fourteenth night with forehead flower-white, and cheeks rosy red, neck like alabaster and teeth than jewels and dews of lips sweeter than sugar, even as saith of him one of his describers,\n\n\"Came to match him in beauty and loveliness rare * Full moons and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gazelles but quoth I, 'Soft fare!\nFare softly, gazelles, nor yourselves compare * With him and, O\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Moons, all your pains forbear!'\"\nAnd how well saith another bard,\n\n\"Slim-waisted loveling, from his hair and brow * Men wake a-morn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in night and light renewed.\nBlame not the mole that dwelleth on his cheek * For Nu'uman's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  bloom aye shows spot negro-hued.\"\n\nWhen the slave-girl beheld Nur al-Din he interposed between her and her wits; she fell in love to him with a great and sudden fall and her heart was taken with affection for him;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the slave-girl beheld Nur al-Din, her heart was taken with affection for him; so she turned to the broker and said to him, \"Will not yonder young merchant, who is sitting among the traders in the gown of striped broadcloth, bid somewhat more for me?\" The broker replied, \"O lady of fair ones, yonder young man is a stranger from Cairo, where his father is chief of the trader-guild and surpasseth all the merchants and notables of the place. He is but lately come to this our city and lodgeth with one of his father's friends; but he hath made no bid for thee nor more nor less.\" When the girl heard the broker's words, she drew from her finger a costly signet-ring of ruby and said to the man, \"Carry me to yonder youth, and if he buy me, this ring shall be thine, in requital of thy travail with me this day.\" The broker rejoiced at this and brought her up to Nur al-Din, and she considered him straitly and found him like the full moon, perfect in loveliness and a model of fine stature and symmetric grace, even as saith of him one of his describers.\n\n\"Waters of beauty o'er his cheeks flow bright, * And rain his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    glances shafts that sorely smite:\nChoked are his lovers an he deal disdain's * Bitterest draught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    denaying love-delight.\nHis forehead and his stature and my love * Are perfect perfected\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    perfection-dight;\nHis raiment folds enfold a lovely neck * As crescent moon in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    collar buttoned tight:\nHis eyne and twinn\u00e8d moles and tears of me * Are night that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    nighteth to the nightliest night.\nHis eyebrows and his features and my frame[FN#470] * Crescents on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     crescents are as crescents slight:\nHis pupils pass the wine-cup to his friends * Which, albe sweet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tastes bitter to my sprite;\nAnd to my thirsty throat pure drink he dealt * From smiling lips\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    what day we were unite:\nThen is my blood to him, my death to him * His right and rightful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    and most righteous right.\"\n\nThe girl gazed at Nur al-Din and said, \"O my lord, Allah upon thee, am I not beautiful?\"; and he replied, \"O Princess of fair ones, is there in the world a comelier than thou?\" She rejoined, \"Then why seest thou all the other merchants bid high for me and art silent nor sayest a word neither addest one dinar to my price? 'Twould seem I please thee not, O my lord!\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, were I in my own land, I had bought thee with all that my hand possesseth of monies;\" and quoth she, \"O my lord, I said not, 'Buy me against thy will,' yet, didst thou but add somewhat to my price, it would hearten my heart, though thou buy me not, so the merchants may say, 'Were not this girl handsome, yonder merchant of Cairo had not bidden for her, for the Cairenes are connoisseurs in slave-girls.'\" These words abashed Nur al-Din and he blushed and said to the broker, \"How high are the biddings for her?\" He replied, \"Her price hath reached nine hundred and sixty dinars,[FN#471] besides brokerage, as for the Sultan's dues, they fall on the seller.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"Let me have her for a thousand dinars, brokerage and price.\" And the damsel hastening to the fore and leaving the broker, said \"I sell myself to this handsome young man for a thousand dinars.\" But Nur al-Din held his peace. Quoth one, \"We sell to him;\" and another, \"He deserveth her;\" and a third, \"Accursed, son of accursed, is he who biddeth and doth not buy!\"; and a fourth, \"By Allah, they befit each other!\" Then, before Nur al-Din could think, the broker fetched Kazis and witnesses, who wrote out a contract of sale and purchase; and the broker handed the paper to Nur al-Din, saying, \"Take thy slave-girl and Allah bless thee in her for she beseemeth none but thee and none but thou beseemeth her.\" And he recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Boom Fortune sought him in humblest way[FN#472] * And came to\nhim draggle-tailed, all a-stir:\nAnd none is fittest for him but she * And none is fittest but he\nfor her.\"\n\nHereat Nur al-Din was abashed before the merchants; so he arose without stay or delay and weighed out the thousand dinars which he had left as a deposit with his father's friend the druggist, and taking the girl, carried her to the house wherein the Shaykh had lodged him. When she entered and saw nothing but ragged patched carpets and worn out rugs, she said to him, \"O my lord, have I no value to thee and am I not worthy that thou shouldst bear me to thine own house and home wherein are thy goods, that thou bringest me into thy servant's lodging? Why dost thou not carry me to thy father's dwelling?\" He replied, \"By Allah, O Princess of fair ones, this is my house wherein I dwell; but it belongeth to an old man, a druggist of this city, who hath set it apart for me and lodged me therein. I told thee that I was a stranger and that I am of the sons of Cairo city.\" She rejoined, \"O my lord, the least of houses sufficeth till thy return to thy native place; but, Allah upon thee, O my lord, go now and fetch us somewhat of roast meat and wine and dried fruit and dessert.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O Princess of fair ones, I had no money with me but the thousand dinars I paid down to thy price nor possess I any other good. The few dirhams I owned were spent by me yesterday.\" Quoth she, \"Hast thou no friend in the town, of whom thou mayst borrow fifty dirhams and bring them to me, that I may tell thee what thou shalt do therewith?\" And he said, \"I have no intimate but the druggist.\" Then he betook himself forthright to the druggist and said to him, \"Peace be with thee, O uncle!\" He returned his salam and said to him, \"O my son, what hast thou bought for a thousand dinars this day?\" Nur al-Din replied, \"I have bought a slave-girl;\" and the oldster rejoined, \"O my son, art thou mad that thou givest a thousand dinars for one slave-girl? Would I knew what kind of slave-girl she is?\" Said Nur al-Din, \"She is a damsel of the children of the Franks;\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din said to the ancient druggist, \"The damsel is of the children of the Franks;\" and the Shaykh said, \"O my son, the best of the girls of the Franks are to be had in this our town for an hundred dinars, and by Allah, O my son, they have cheated thee in the matter of this damsel! However, an thou have taken a fancy to her, lie with her this night and do thy will of her and to-morrow morning go down with her to the market and sell her, though thou lose by her two hundred dinars, and reckon that thou hast lost them by shipwreck or hast been robbed of them on the road.\" Nur al-Din replied, \"Right is thy rede, O uncle, but thou knowest that I had but the thousand dinars wherewith I purchased the damsel, and now I have not a single dirham left to spend; so I desire of thy favour and bounty that thou lend me fifty dirhams, to provide me withal, till to-morrow, when I will sell her and repay thee out of her price.\" Said the old man, \"Willingly, O my son,\" and counted out to him the fifty dirhams. Then he said to him, \"O my son, thou art but young in years and the damsel is fair, so belike thy heart will be taken with her and it will be grievous to thee to vend her. Now thou hast nothing to live on and these fifty dirhams will readily be spent and thou wilt come to me and I shall lend thee once and twice and thrice, and so on up to ten times; but, an thou come to me after this, I will not return thy salam[FN#473] and our friendship with thy father will end ill.\" Nur al-Din took the fifty dirhams and returned with them to the damsel, who said to him, \"O my lord, wend thee at once to the market and fetch me twenty dirhams' worth of stained silk of five colours and with the other thirty buy meat and bread and fruit and wine and flowers.\" So he went to the market and purchasing for her all she sought, brought it to her, whereupon she rose and tucking up her sleeves, cooked food after the most skilful fashion, and set it before him. He ate and she ate with him, till they had enough, after which she set on the wine, and she drank and he drank, and she ceased not to ply him with drink and entertain him with discourse, till he became drunken and fell asleep. Thereupon she arose without stay or delay and taking out of her bundle a budget of T\u00e1if\u00ed leather,[FN#474] opened it and drew forth a pair of knitting needles, wherewith she fell to work and stinted not till she had made a beautiful zone, which she folded up in a wrapper after cleaning it and ironing it, and laid it under her pillow. Then she doffed her dress till she was mother-naked and lying down beside Nur al-Din shampoo'd him till he awoke from his heavy sleep. He found by his side a maiden like virgin silver, softer than silk and delicater than a tail of fatted sheep, than standard more conspicuous and goodlier than the red camel,[FN#475] in height five feet tall with breasts firm and full, brows like bended bows, eyes like gazelles' eyes and cheeks like blood-red anemones, a slender waist with dimples laced and a navel holding an ounce of the unguent benzoin, thighs like bolsters stuffed with ostrich-down, and between them what the tongue fails to set forth and at mention whereof the tears jet forth. Brief it was as it were she to whom the poet alluded in these two couplets,\n\n\"From her hair is Night, from her forehead Noon * From her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  side-face Rose; from her lip wine boon:\nFrom her Union Heaven, her Severance Hell: * Pearls from her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  teeth; from her front full Moon.\"\nAnd how excellent is the saying of another bard,[FN#476]\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow-wand she waves * Breathes ambergris and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  gazeth a gazelle.\nMeseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins * And when she wends\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   makes haste therein to dwell.\nHer face is fairer than the Stars of Wealth[FN#477] * And sheeny\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   brows the crescent Moon excel.\"\nAnd quoth a third also,\n\n\"They shine fullest Moons, unveil Crescent-bright; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Sway tenderest Branches and turn wild kine;\n'Mid which is a Dark-eyed for love of whose charms *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Sailors[FN#478] would joy to be ground low-li'en.\"\n\nSo Nur al-Din turned to her at once and clasping her to his bosom, sucked first her upper lip and then her under lip and slid his tongue between the twain into her mouth. Then he rose to her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly none but he had ridden. So he abated her maidenhead and had of her amorous delight and there was knitted between them a love-bond which might never know breach nor severance.[FN#479] He rained upon her cheeks kisses like the falling of pebbles into water, and struck with stroke upon stroke, like the thrusting of spears in battle brunt; for that Nur al-Din still yearned after clipping of necks and sucking of lips and letting down of tress and pressing of waist and biting of cheek and cavalcading on breast with Cairene buckings and Yamani wrigglings and Abyssinian sobbings and Hind\u00ed pamoisons and Nubian lasciviousness and R\u00edf\u00ed leg-liftings[FN#480] and Damiettan moanings and Sa'\u00edd\u00ed[FN#481] hotness and Alexandrian languishment[FN#482] and this damsel united in herself all these virtues, together with excess of beauty and loveliness, and indeed she was even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"This is she I will never forget till I die * Nor draw near but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   to those who to her draw nigh.\nA being for semblance like Moon at full * Praise her Maker, her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Modeller glorify!\nTho' be sore my sin seeking love-liesse * On esperance-day ne'er\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   repent can I;\nA couplet reciting which none can know * Save the youth who in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   couplets and rhymes shall cry,\n'None weeteth love but who bears its load * Nor passion, save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  pleasures and pains he aby.'\"\n\nSo Nur al-Din lay with the damsel through the night in solace and delight,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din lay with that damsel through the night in solace and delight, the twain garbed in the closely buttoned garments of embrace, safe and secure against the misways of nights and days, and they passed the dark hours after the goodliest fashion, fearing naught, in their joys love-fraught, from excess of talk and prate. As saith of them the right excellent poet,[FN#483]\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter; envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the merciful\nNe'er make a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each other's arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly thine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"\n\nWhen the morning morrowed in sheen and shone, Nur al-Din awoke from deep sleep and found that she had brought water:[FN#484] so they made the Ghusl-ablution, he and she, and he performed that which behoved him of prayer to his Lord, after which she set before him meat and drink, and he ate and drank. Then the damsel put her hand under her pillow and pulling out the girdle which she had knitted during the night, gave it to Nur al-Din, who asked, \"Whence cometh this girdle?\"[FN#485] Answered she, \"O my lord, 'tis the silk thou boughtest yesterday for twenty dirhams. Rise now and go to the Persian bazar and give it to the broker, to cry for sale, and sell it not for less than twenty gold pieces in ready money.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"O Princess of fair ones how can a thing, that cost twenty dirhams and will sell for as many dinars, be made in a single night?\"; and quoth she, \"O my lord, thou knowest not the value of this thing; but go to the market therewith and give it to the broker, and when he shall cry it, its worth will be made manifest to thee.\" Herewith he carried the zone to the market and gave it to the broker, bidding him cry it, whilst he himself sat down on a masonry bench before a shop. The broker fared forth and returning after a while said to him, \"O my lord, rise take the price of thy zone, for it hath fetched twenty dinars money down.\" When Nur al-Din heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and shook with delight. Then he rose, between belief and misbelief, to take the money and when he had received it, he went forthright and spent it all on silk of various colours and returning home, gave his purchase to the damsel, saying, \"Make this all into girdles and teach me likewise how to make them, that I may work with thee; for never in the length of my life saw I a fairer craft than this craft nor a more abounding in gain and profit. By Allah, 'tis better than the trade of a merchant a thousand times!\" She laughed at his language and said, \"O my lord, go to thy friend the druggist and borrow other thirty dirhams of him, and to-morrow repay him from the price of the girdle the thirty together with the fifty already loaned to thee.\" So he rose and repaired to the druggist and said to him, \"O Uncle, lend me other thirty dirhams, and to-morrow, Almighty Allah willing, I will repay thee the whole fourscore.\" The old man weighed him out thirty dirhams, wherewith he went to the market and buying meat and bread, dried fruits, and flowers as before, carried them home to the damsel whose name was Miriam,[FN#486] the Girdle-girl. She rose forthright and making ready rich meats, set them before her lord Nur al-Din; after which she brought the wine-service and they drank and plied each other with drink. When the wine began to play with their wits, his pleasant address and inner grace pleased her, and she recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Said I to Slim-waist who the wine engraced * Brought in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  musk-scented bowl and a superfine,\n'Was it prest from thy cheek?' He replied 'Nay, nay! * When did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  man from Roses e'er press the Wine?'\"\n\nAnd the damsel ceased not to carouse with her lord and ply him with cup and bowl and require him to fill for her and give her to drink of that which sweeteneth the spirits, and whenever he put forth hand to her, she drew back from him, out of coquetry. The wine added to her beauty and loveliness, and Nur al-Din recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Slim-waist craved wine from her companeer; * Cried (in meeting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  of friends when he feared for his fere,)\n'An thou pass not the wine thou shalt pass the night, * A-banisht\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  my bed!' And he felt sore fear.\"\n\nThey ceased not drinking till drunkenness overpowered Nur al-Din and he slept; whereupon she rose forthright and fell to work upon a zone, as was her wont. When she had wrought it to end, she wrapped it in paper and doffing her clothes, lay down by his side and enjoyed dalliance and delight till morn appeared.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Miriam the Girdle-girl, having finished her zone and wrapped it in paper doffed her dress and lay down by the side of her lord; and then happened to them what happened of dalliance and delight; and he did his devoir like a man. On the morrow, she gave him the girdle and said to him, \"Carry this to the market and sell it for twenty dinars, even as thou soldest its fellow yesterday.\" So he went to the bazar and sold the girdle for twenty dinars, after which he repaired to the druggist and paid him back the eighty dirhams, thanking him for the bounties and calling down blessings upon him. He asked, \"O my son, hast thou sold the damsel?\"; and Nur al-Din answered, \"Wouldst thou have me sell the soul out of my body?\" and he told him all that had passed, from commencement to conclusion, whereat the druggist joyed with joy galore, than which could be no more and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, thou gladdenest me! Inshallah, mayst thou ever be in prosperity! Indeed I wish thee well by reason of my affection for thy ather and the continuance of my friendship with him.\" Then Nur al-Din left the Shaykh and straightway going to the market, bought meat and fruit and wine and all that he needed according to his custom and returned therewith to Miriam. They abode thus a whole year in eating and drinking and mirth and merriment and love and good comradeship, and every night she made a zone and he sold it on the morrow for twenty dinars, wherewith he bought their needs and gave the rest to her, to keep against a time of necessity. After the twelvemonth she said to him one day, \"O my lord, whenas thou sellest the girdle to-morrow, buy for me with its price silk of six colours, because I am minded to make thee a kerchief to wear on thy shoulders, such as never son of merchant, no, nor King's son, ever rejoiced in its like.\" So next day he fared forth to the bazar and after selling the zone brought her the dyed silks she sought and Miriam the Girdle-girl wrought at the kerchief a whole week, for, every night, when she had made an end of the zone, she would work awhile at the kerchief till it was finished. Then she gave it to Nur al-Din, who put it on his shoulders and went out to walk in the market-place, whilst all the merchants and folk and notables of the town crowded about him, to gaze on his beauty and that of the kerchief which was of the most beautiful. Now it chanced that one night, after this, he awoke from sleep and found Miriam weeping passing sore and reciting these couplets,\n\n\"Nears my parting fro' my love, nigher draws the Severance-day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Ah well-away for parting! and again ah well-away!\nAnd in tway is torn my heart and O pine I'm doomed to bear * For\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the nights that erst witnessed our pleasurable play!\nNo help for it but Envier the twain of us espy * With evil eye\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    and win to us his lamentable way.\nFor naught to us is sorer than the jealousy of men * And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   backbiter's eyne that with calumny affray.\"\n\nHe said, \"O my lady Miriam,[FN#487] what aileth thee to weep?\"; and she replied, \"I weep for the anguish of parting for my heart presageth me thereof.\" Quoth he, \"O lady of fair ones, and who shall interpose between us, seeing that I love thee above all creatures and tender thee the most?\"; and quoth she, \"And I love thee twice as well as thou me; but fair opinion of fortune still garreth folk fall into affliction, and right well saith the poet,[FN#488]\n\n'Think'st thou thyself all prosperous, in days which prosp'rous\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  be,\nNor fearest thou impending ill, which comes by Heaven's decree?\nWe see the orbs of heav'n above, how numberless they are,\nBut sun and moon alone eclips'd, and ne'er a lesser star!\nAnd many a tree on earth we see, some bare, some leafy green,\nOf them, not one is hurt with stone save that has fruitful been!\nSee'st not th' refluent ocean, bear carrion on its tide,\nWhile pearls beneath its wavy flow, fixed in the deep, abide?'\"\n\nPresently she added, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, an thou desire to nonsuit separation, be on thy guard against a swart-visaged oldster, blind of the right eye and lame of the left leg; for he it is who will be the cause of our severance. I saw him enter the city and I opine that he is come hither in quest of me.\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"O lady of fair ones, if my eyes light on him, I will slay him and make an example of him.\" Rejoined she, \"O my lord, slay him not; but talk not nor trade with him, neither buy nor sell with him nor sit nor walk with him nor speak one word to him, no, not even the answer prescribed by law,[FN#489] and I pray Allah to preserve us from his craft and his mischief.\" Next morning, Nur al-Din took the zone and carried it to the market, where he sat down on a shop-bench and talked with the sons of the merchants, till the drowsiness preceding slumber overcame him and he lay down on the bench and fell asleep. Presently, behold, up came the Frank whom the damsel had described to him, in company with seven others, and seeing Nur al-Din lying asleep on the bench, with his head wrapped in the kerchief which Miriam had made for him and the edge thereof in his grasp, sat down by him and hent the end of the kerchief in hand and examined it, turning it over for some time. Nur al-Din sensed that there was something and awoke; then, seeing the very man of whom Miriam had warned him sitting by his side, cried out at him with a great cry which startled him. Quoth the Frank, \"What aileth thee to cry out thus at us? Have we taken from thee aught?\"; and quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O accursed, haddest thou taken aught from me, I would carry thee before the Chief of Police!\" Then said the Frank, \"O Moslem, I conjure thee by thy faith and by that wherein thou believest, inform me whence thou haddest this kerchief;\" and Nur al-Din replied, \"Tis the handiwork of my lady mother,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Frank asked Nur al-Din anent the maker of the kerchief, he answered, saying, \"In very sooth this kerchief is the handiwork of my mother, who made it for me with her own hand.\" Quoth the Frank \"Wilt thou sell it to me and take ready money for it?,\" and quoth Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, I will not sell it to thee or to any else, for she made none other than it.\" \"Sell it to me and I will give thee to its price this very moment five hundred dinars, money down; and let her who made it make thee another and a finer.\" \"I will not sell it at all, for there is not the like of it in this city.\" \"O my lord, wilt thou sell it for six hundred ducats of fine gold?\" And the Frank went on to add to his offer hundred by hundred, till he bid nine hundred dinars; but Nur al-Din said, \"Allah will open to me otherwise than by my vending it. I will never sell it, not for two thousand dinars nor more than that; no, never.\" The Frank ceased not to tempt him with money, till he bid him a thousand dinars, and the merchants present said, \"We sell thee the kerchief at that price:[FN#490] pay down the money.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"I will not sell it, I swear by Allah!\"[FN#491] But one of the merchants said to him, \"Know thou, O my son, that the value of this kerchief is an hundred dinars at most and that to an eager purchaser, and if this Frank pay thee down a thousand for it, thy profit will be nine hundred dinars, and what gain canst thou desire greater than this gain? Wherefore 'tis my rede that thou sell him this kerchief at that price and bid her who wrought it make thee other finer than it: so shalt thou profit nine hundred dinars by this accursed Frank, the enemy of Allah and of The Faith.\" Nur al-Din was abashed at the merchants and sold the kerchief to the Frank, who, in their presence, paid him down the thousand dinars, with which he would have returned to his handmaid to congratulate her on what had passed; but the stranger said, \"Harkye, O company of merchants, stop my lord Nur al-Din, for you and he are my guests this night. I have a jar of old Greek wine and a fat lamb, fresh fruit, flowers and confections; wherefore do ye all cheer me with your company to-night and not one of you tarry behind.\" So the merchants said, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, we desire that thou be with us on the like of this night, so we may talk together, we and thou, and we pray thee, of thy favour and bounty, to bear us company, so we and thou, may be the guests of this Frank, for he is a liberal man.\" And they conjured him by the oath of divorce[FN#492] and hindered him by main force from going home. Then they rose forthright and shutting up their shops, took Nur al-Din and fared with the Frank, who brought them to a goodly and spacious saloon, wherein were two da\u00efses. Here he made them sit and set before them a scarlet tray-cloth of goodly workmanship and unique handiwork, wroughten in gold with figures of breaker and broken, lover and beloved, asker and asked, whereon he ranged precious vessels of porcelain and crystal, full of the costliest confections, fruits and flowers, and brought them a flagon of old Greek wine. Then he bade slaughter a fat lamb and kindling fire, proceeded to roast of its flesh and feed the merchants therewith and give them draughts of that wine, winking at them the while to ply Nur al-Din with drink. Accordingly they ceased not plying him with wine till he became drunken and took leave of his wits; so when the Frank saw that he was drowned in liquor, he said to him, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, thou gladdenest us with thy company to-night: welcome, and again welcome to thee.\" Then he engaged him awhile in talk, till he could draw near to him, when he said, with dissembling speech, \"O my lord, Nur al-Din, wilt thou sell me thy slave-girl, whom thou boughtest in presence of these merchants a year ago for a thousand dinars? I will give thee at this moment five thousand gold pieces for her and thou wilt thus make four thousand ducats profit.\" Nur al-Din refused, but the Frank ceased not to ply him with meat and drink and lure him with lucre, still adding to his offers, till he bid him ten thousand dinars for her; whereupon Nur al-Din, in his drunkenness, said before the merchants, \"I sell her to thee for ten thousand dinars: hand over the money.\" At this the Frank rejoiced with joy exceeding and took the merchants to witness the sale. They passed the night in eating and drinking, mirth and merriment, till the morning, when the Frank cried out to his pages, saying, \"Bring me the money.\" So they brought it to him and he counted out ten thousand dinars to Nur al-Din, saying, \"O my lord, take the price of thy slave-girl, whom thou soldest to me last night, in the presence of these Moslem merchants.\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"O accursed, I sold thee nothing and thou liest anent me, for I have no slave-girls.\" Quoth the Frank, \"In very sooth thou didst sell her to me and these merchants were witnesses to the bargain.\" Thereupon all said, \"Yes, indeed! thou soldest him thy slave-girl before us for ten thousand dinars, O Nur al-Din and we will all bear witness against thee of the sale. Come, take the money and deliver him the girl, and Allah will give thee a better than she in her stead. Doth it irk thee, O Nur al-Din, that thou boughtest the girl for a thousand dinars and hast enjoyed for a year and a half her beauty and loveliness and taken thy fill of her converse and her favours? Furthermore thou hast gained some ten thousand golden dinars by the sale of the zones which she made thee every day and thou soldest for twenty sequins, and after all this thou hast sold her again at a profit of nine thousand dinars over and above her original price. And withal thou deniest the sale and belittlest and makest difficulties about the profit! What gain is greater than this gain and what profit wouldst thou have profitabler than this profit? An thou love her thou hast had thy fill of her all this time: so take the money and buy thee another handsomer than she; at a dowry of less than half this price, and the rest of the money will remain in thy hand as capital.\" And the merchants ceased not to ply him with persuasion and special arguments till he took the ten thousand dinars, the price of the damsel, and the Frank straightway fetched Kazis and witnesses, who drew up the contract of sale by Nur al-Din of the handmaid hight Miriam the Girdle-girl. Such was his case; but as regards the damsel's, she sat awaiting her lord from morning till sundown and from sundown till the noon of night; and when he returned not, she was troubled and wept with sore weeping. The old druggist heard her sobbing and sent his wife, who went in to her and finding her in tears, said to her, \"O my lady, what aileth her and finding her in tears, said to her, \"O my lady, what aileth thee to weep?\" Said she, \"O my mother, I have sat waiting the return of my lord, Nur al-Din all day; but he cometh not, and I fear lest some one have played a trick on him, to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Miriam the Girdle-girl said to the druggist's wife, \"I am fearful lest some one have been playing a trick on my lord to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me.\" Said the other, \"O my lady Miriam, were they to give thy lord this hall full of gold as thy price, yet would he not sell thee, for what I know of his love to thee. But, O my lady, belike there be a company come from his parents at Cairo and he hath made them an entertainment in the lodging where they alighted, being ashamed to bring them hither, for that the place is not spacious enough for them or because their condition is less than that he should bring them to his own house; or belike he preferred to conceal thine affair from them, so passed the night with them; and Inshallah! to-morrow he will come to thee safe and sound. So burden not thy soul with cark and care, O my lady, for of a certainty this is the cause of his absence from thee last night and I will abide with thee this coming night and comfort thee, until thy lord return to thee.\" So the druggist's wife abode with her and cheered her with talk throughout the dark hours and, when it was morning, Miriam saw her lord enter the street followed by the Frank and amiddlemost a company of merchants, at which sight her side-muscles quivered and her colour changed and she fell a-shaking, as ship shaketh in mid-ocean for the violence of the gale. When the druggist's wife saw this, she said to her, \"O my lady Miriam what aileth thee that I see thy case changed and thy face grown pale and show disfeatured?\" Replied she, \"By Allah, O my lady, my heart forebodeth me of parting and severance of union!\" And she bemoaned herself with the saddest sighs, reciting these couplets,[FN#493]\n\n\"Incline not to parting, I pray; * For bitter its savour is aye.\nE'en the sun at his setting turns pale * To think he must part\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   from the day;\nAnd so, at his rising, for joy * Of reunion, he's radiant and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gay.\"\n\nThen Miriam wept passing sore wherethan naught could be more, making sure of separation, and cried to the druggist's wife, \"O my mother, said I not to thee that my lord Nur al-Din had been tricked into selling me? I doubt not but he hath sold me this night to yonder Frank, albeit I bade him beware of him; but deliberation availeth not against destiny. So the truth of my words is made manifest to thee.\" Whilst they were talking, behold, in came Nur al-Din, and the damsel looked at him and saw that his colour was changed and that he trembled and there appeared on his face signs of grief and repentance: so she said to him, \"O my lord Nur al-Din, meseemeth thou hast sold me.\" Whereupon he wept with sore weeping and groaned and lamented and recited these couplets,[FN#494]\n\n\"When e'er the Lord 'gainst any man,\nWould fulminate some harsh decree,\nAnd he be wise, and skilled to hear,\nAnd used to see;\nHe stops his ears, and blinds his heart,\nAnd from his brain ill judgment tears,\nAnd makes it bald as 'twere a scalp,\nReft of its hairs;[FN#495]\nUntil the time when the whole man\nBe pierced by this divine command;\nThen He restores him intellect\nTo understand.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din began to excuse himself to his handmaid, saying, \"By Allah, O my lady Miriam, verily runneth the Reed with whatso Allah hath decreed. The folk put a cheat on me to make me sell thee, and I fell into the snare and sold thee. Indeed, I have sorely failed of my duty to thee; but haply He who decreed our disunion will vouchsafe us reunion.\" Quoth she, \"I warned thee against this, for this it was I dreaded.\" Then she strained him to her bosom and kissed him between the eyes, reciting these couplets,\n\n\"Now, by your love! your love I'll ne'er forget, * Though lost my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   life for stress of pine and fret:\nI weep and wail through livelong day and night * As moans the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dove on sandhill-tree beset.\nO fairest friends, your absence spoils my life; * Nor find I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    meeting-place as erst we met.\"\n\nAt this juncture, behold, the Frank came in to them and went up to Miriam, to kiss her hands; but she dealt him a buffet with her palm on the cheek, saying, \"Avaunt, O accursed! Thou hast followed after me without surcease, till thou hast cozened my lord into selling me! But O accursed, all shall yet be well, Inshallah!\" The Frank laughed at her speech and wondered at her deed and excused himself to her, saying, \"O my lady Mirian, what is my offence? Thy lord Nur al-Din here sold thee of his full consent and of his own free will. Had he loved thee, by the right of the Messiah, he had not transgressed against thee! And had he not fulfilled his desire of thee, he had not sold thee.\" Quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Whom I irk let him fly fro' me fast and faster * If I name his\nname I am no directer.\nNor the wide wide world is to me so narrow * That I act expecter\nto this rejecter.'\"[FN#496]\n\nNow this handmaid was the daughter of the King of France, the which is a wide an spacious city,[FN#497] abounding in manufactures and rarities and trees and flowers and other growths, and resembleth the city of Constantinople; and for her going forth of her father's city there was a wondrous cause and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale which we will set out in due order, to divert and delight the hearer.[FN#498]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the cause of Miriam the Girdle-girl leaving her father and mother was a wondrous and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale. She was reared with her father and mother in honour and indulgence and learnt rhetoric and penmanship and arithmetic and cavalarice and all manner crafts, such as broidery and sewing and weaving and girdle-making and silk-cord making and damascening gold on silver and silver on gold, brief all the arts both of men and women, till she became the union-pearl of her time and the unique gem of her age and day. Moreover, Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) had endowed her with such beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfection of grace that she excelled therein all the folk of her time, and the Kings of the isles sought her in marriage of her sire, but he refused to give her to wife to any of her suitors, for that he loved her with passing love and could not bear to be parted from her a single hour. Moreover, he had no other daughter than herself, albeit he had many sons, but she was dearer to him than all of them. It fortuned one year that she fell sick of an exceeding sickness and came nigh upon death, werefore she made a vow that, if she recovered from her malady, she would make the pilgrimage to a certain monastery, situate in such an island, which was high in repute among the Franks, who used to make vows to it and look for a blessing therefrom. When Miriam recovered from her sickness, she wished to accomplish her vow anent the monastery and her sire despatched her to the convent in a little ship, with sundry daughters of the city-notables to wait upon her and patrician Knights to protect them all. As they drew near the island, there came out upon them a ship of the ships of the Moslems, champions of The Faith, warring in Allah's way, who boarded the vessel and making prize of all therein, knights and maidens, gifts and monies, sold their booty in the city of Kayraw\u00e1n.[FN#499] Miriam herself fell into the hands of a Persian merchant, who was born impotent[FN#500] and for whom no woman had ever discovered her nakedness; so he set her to serve him. Presently, he fell ill and sickened well nigh unto death, and the sickness abode with him two months, during which she tended him after the goodliest fashion, till Allah made him whole of his malady, when he recalled her tenderness and loving-kindness to him and the persistent zeal with which she had nurst him and being minded to requite her the good offices she had done him, said to her, \"Ask a boon of me?\" She said, \"O my lord, I ask of thee that thou sell me not but to the man of my choice.\" He answered, \"So be it. I guarantee thee. By Allah, O Miriam, I will not sell thee but to him of whom thou shalt approve, and I put thy sale in thine own hand.\" And she rejoiced herein with joy exceeding. Now the Persian had expounded to her Al-Islam and she became a Moslemah and learnt of him the rules of worship. Furthermore during that period the Perisan had taught her the tenets of The Faith and the observances incumbent upon her: he had made her learn the Koran by heart and master somewhat of the theological sciences and the traditions of the Prophet; after which, he brought her to Alexandria-city and sold her to Nur al-Din, as we have before set out. Meanwhile, when her father, the King of France, heard what had befallen his daughter and her company, he saw Doomsday break and sent after her ships full of knights and champions, horsemen and footsmen; but they fell not in any trace of her whom they sought in the Islands[FN#501] of the Moslems; so all returned to him, crying out and saying, \"Well-away!\" and \"Ruin!\" and \"Well worth the day!\" The King grieved for her with exceeding grief and sent after her that one-eyed lameter, blind of the left,[FN#502] for that he was his chief Wazir, a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil,[FN#503] full of craft and guile, bidding him make search for her in all the lands of the Moslems and buy her, though with a ship-load of gold. So the accursed sought her, in all the islands of the Arabs and all the cities of the Moslems, but found no sign of her till he came to Alexandria-city where he made quest for her and presently discovered that she was with Nur al-Din Ali the Cairene, being directed to the trace of her by the kerchief aforesaid, for that none could have wrought it in such goodly guise but she. Then he bribed the merchants to help him in getting her from Nur al-Din and beguiled her lord into selling her, as hath been already related. When he had her in his possession, she ceased not to weep and wail: so he said to her, \"O my lady Miriam, put away from thee this mourning and grieving and return with me to the city of thy sire, the seat of thy kingship and the place of thy power and thy home, so thou mayst be among thy servants and attendants and be quit of this abasement and this strangerhood. Enough hath betided me of travail, of travel and of disbursing monies on thine account, for thy father bade me buy thee back, though with a shipload of gold; and now I have spent nigh a year and a half in seeking thee.\" And he fell to kissing her hands and feet and humbling himself to her; but the more he kissed and grovelled she only redoubled in wrath against him, and said to him, \"O accursed, may Almighty Allah not vouchsafe thee to win thy wish!\" Presently his pages brought her a shemule with gold-embroidered housings and mounting her thereon, raised over her head a silken canopy, with staves of gold and silver, and the Franks walked round about her, till they brought her forth the city by the sea-gate,[FN#504] where they took boat with her and rowing out to a great ship in harbor embarked therein. Then the monocular Wazir cried out to the sailors, saying, \"Up with the mast!\" So they set it up forthright and spreading the newly bent sails and the colours manned the sweeps and put out to sea. Meanwhile Miriam continued to gaze upon Alexandria, till it disappeared from her eyes, when she fell a-weeping in her privacy with sore weeping.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir of the Frankish King put out to sea in the ship bearing Miriam the Girdle-girl, she gazed Alexandria-wards till the city was hidden from her sight when she wailed and wept copious tears and recited these couplets,\n\n\"O dwelling of my friends say is there no return * Uswards? But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   what ken I of matters Allah made?\nStill fare the ships of Severance, sailing hastily * And in my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wounded eyelids tear have ta'en their stead,\nFor parting from a friend who was my wish and will * Healed every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   ill and every pain and pang allay'd.\nBe thou, O Allah, substitute of me for him * Such charge some day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the care of Thee shall not evade.\"\n\nThen she could not refrain from weeping and wailing. So the patrician[FN#505] knights came up to her and would have comforted her, but she heeded not their consoling words, being distracted by the claims of passion and love-longing. And she shed tears and moaned and complained and recited these couplets,\n\n\"The tongue of Love within my vitals speaketh * Saying, 'This\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lover boon of Love aye seeketh!'\nAnd burn my liver hottest coals of passion * And parting on my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heart sore suffering wreaketh.\nHow shall I face this fiery love concealing * When fro' my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  wounded lids the tear aye leaketh?\n\nIn this plight Miriam abode during all the voyage; no peace was left her at all nor would patience come at her call. Such was her case in company with the Wazir, the monocular, the lameter; but as regards Nur al-Din the Cairene, when the ship had sailed with Miriam, the world was straitened upon him and he had neither peace nor patience. He returned to the lodging where they twain had dwelt, and its aspect was black and gloomy in his sight. Then he saw the m\u00e9tier wherewith she had been wont to make the zones and her dress that had been upon her beauteous body; so he pressed them to his breast, whilst the tears gushed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Say me, will Union after parting e'er return to be * After\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   long-lasting torments, after hopeless misery?\nAlas! Alas! what wont to be shall never more return * But grant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   me still return of dearest her these eyne may see.\nI wonder me will Allah deign our parted lives unite * And will my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dear one's plighted troth preserve with constancy!\nNaught am I save the prey of death since parting parted us; * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   will my friends consent that I am a wierd so deadly dree?\nAlas my sorrow!

O Miriam! Was it but a vision of thee I saw in sleep or in the allusions of dreams?\" And by reason of that which grew on him of regrets, he recited these couplets,[FN#506]\n\n\"Mazed with thy love no more I can feign patience,\nThis heart of mine has held none dear but thee!\nAnd if mine eye hath gazed on other's beauty,\nNe'er be it joyed again with sight of thee!\nI've sworn an oath I'll ne'er forget to love thee,\nAnd sad's this breast that pines to meet with thee!\nThou'st made me drink a love-cup full of passion,\nBlest time! When I may give the draught to thee!\nTake with thee this my form where'er thou goest,\nAnd when thou 'rt dead let me be laid near thee!\nCall on me in my tomb, my bones shall answer\nAnd sigh responses to a call from thee!\n\nIf it were asked, 'What wouldst thou Heaven should order?'\n'His will,' I answer, 'First, and then what pleases thee.'\"\n\nAs Nur al-Din was in this case, weeping and crying out, \"O Miriam! O Miriam!\" behold, an old man landed from a vessel and coming up to him, saw him shedding tears and heard him reciting these verses,\n\n\"O Maryam of beauty[FN#507] return, for these eyne * Are as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   densest clouds railing drops in line:\nAsk amid mankind and my railers shall say * That mine eyelids are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  drowning these eyeballs of mine.\"\n\nSaid the old man, \"O my son, meseems thou weepest for the damsel who sailed yesterday with the Frank?\" When Nur al-Din heard these words of the Shaykh he fell down in a swoon and lay for a long while without life; then, coming to himself, he wept with sore weeping and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Shall we e'er be unite after severance-tide * And return in the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    perfectest cheer to bide?\nIn my heart indeed is a lowe of love * And I'm pained by the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    spies who my pain deride:\nMy days I pass in amaze distraught, * And her image a-nights I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   would see by side:\nBy Allah, no hour brings me solace of love * And how can it when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   makebates vex me and chide?\nA soft-sided damsel of slenderest waist * Her arrows of eyne on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    my heart hath plied?\nHer form is like B\u00e1n[FN#508]-tree branch in garth * Shame her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    charms the sun who his face most hide:\nDid I not fear God (be He glorified!) * 'My Fair be glorified!'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Had I cried.\"\n\nThe old man looked at him and noting his beauty and grace and symmetry and the fluency of his tongue and the seductiveness of his charms, had ruth on him and his heart mourned for his case. Now that Shaykh was the captain of a ship, bound to the damsel's city, and in this ship were a hundred Moslem merchants, men of the Saving Faith; so he said to Nur al-Din, \"Have patience and all will yet be well; I will bring thee to her an it be the will of Allah, extolled and exalted be He!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old skipper said to Nur al-Din, \"I will bring thee to her, Inshallah!\" the youth asked, \"When shall we set out?\" and the other said, \"Come but three days more and we will depart in peace and prosperity.\" Nur al-Din rejoiced at the captain's words with joy exceeding and thanked him for his bounty and benevolence. Then he recalled the days of love-liesse dear and union with his slave-girl without peer, and he shed bitter tears and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Say, will to me and you the Ruthful union show * My lords! Shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    e'er I win the wish of me or no?\nA visit-boon by you will shifty Time vouchsafe? * And seize your\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    image eye-lids which so hungry grow?\nWith you were Union to be sold, I fain would buy; * But ah, I see\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   such grace doth all my means outgo!\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din went forthright to the market and bought what he needed of viaticum and other necessaries for the voyage and returned to the Rais, who said to him, \"O my son, what is that thou hast with thee?\" said he, \"My provisions and all whereof I have need for the voyage.\" Thereupon quoth the old man, laughing, \"O my son, art thou going a-pleasuring to Pompey's Pillar?[FN#509] Verily, between thee and that thou seekest is two months' journey and the wind be fair and the weather favourable.\" Then he took of him somewhat of money and going to the bazar, bought him a sufficiency of all that he needed for the voyage and filled him a large earthen jar[FN#510] with fresh water. Nur al-Din abode in the ship three days until the merchants had made an end of their precautions and preparations and embarked, when they set sail and putting out to sea, fared on one-and-fifty days. After this, there came out upon them corsairs,[FN#511] pirates who sacked the ship and taking Nur al-Din and all therein prisoners, carried them to the city of France and paraded them before the King, who bade cast them into jail, Nur al-Din amongst the number. As they were being led to prison the galleon[FN#512] arrived with the Princess Miriam and the one-eyed Wazir, and when it made the harbour, the lameter landed and going up to the King gave him the glad news of his daughter's safe return: whereupon they beat the kettledrums for good tidings and decorated the city after the goodliest fashion. Then the King took horse, with all his guards and lords and notables and rode down to the sea to meet her. The moment the ship cast anchor she came ashore, and the King saluted her and embraced her and mounting her on a bloodsteed, bore her to the palace, where her mother received her with open arms, and asked her of her case and whether she was a maid as before or whether she had become a woman carnally known by man.[FN#513] She replied, \"O my mother, how should a girl, who hath been sold from merchant to merchant in the land of Moslems, a slave commanded, abide a virgin? The merchant who bought me threatened me with the bastinado and violenced me and took my maidenhead, after which he sold me to another and he again to a third.\" When the Queen heard these her words, the light in her eyes became night and she repeated her confession to the King who was chagrined thereat and his affair was grievous to him. So he expounded her case to his Grandees and Patricians[FN#514] who said to him, \"O King, she hath been defiled by the Moslems and naught will purify her save the striking off of an hundred Mohammedan heads.\" Whereupon the King sent for the True Believers he had imprisoned; and they decapitated them, one after another, beginning with the captain, till none was left save Nur al-Din. They tare off a strip of his skirt and binding his eyes therewith, led him to the rug of blood and were about to smite his neck, when behold, an ancient dame came up to the King at that very moment and said, \"O my lord, thou didst vow to bestow upon each and every church five Moslem captives, to held us in the service thereof, so Allah would restore thee thy daughter the Princess Miriam; and now she is restored to thee, so do thou fulfil thy vow.\" The King replied, \"O my mother, by the virtue of the Messiah and the Veritable Faith, there remaineth to me of the prisoners but this one captive, whom they are about to put to death: so take him with thee to help in the service of the church, till there come to me more prisoners of the Moslems, when I will send thee other four. Hadst thou come earlier, before they hewed off the heads of these, I had given thee as many as thou wouldest have.\" The old woman thanked the King for his boon and wished him continuance of life, glory and prosperity. Then without loss of time she went up to Nur al-Din, whom she raised from the rug of blood; and, looking narrowly at him saw a comely youth and a dainty, with a delicate skin and a face like the moon at her full; whereupon she carried him to the church and said to him, \"O my son, doff these clothes which are upon thee, for they are fit only for the service of the Sultan.\"[FN#515] So saying the ancient dame brought him a gown and hood of black wool and a broad girdle,[FN#516] in which she clad and cowled him; and, after binding on his belt, bade him do the service of the church. Accordingly, he served the church seven days, at the end of which time behold, the old woman came up to him and said, \"O Moslem, don thy silken dress and take these ten dirhams and go out forthright and divert thyself abroad this day, and tarry not here a single moment, lest thou lose thy life.\" Quoth he, \"What is to do, O my mother?\"; and quoth she, \"Know, O my son, that the King's daughter, the Princess Miriam the Girdle-girl, hath a mind to visit the church this day, to seek a blessing by pilgrimage and to make oblation thereto, a douceur[FN#517] of thank-offering for her deliverance from the land of the Moslems and in fulfilment of the vows she vowed to the Messiah, so he would save her. With her are four hundred damsels, not one of whom but is perfect in beauty and loveliness and all of them are daughters of Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees: they will be here during this very hour and if their eyes fall on thee in this church, they will hew thee in pieces with swords.\" Thereupon Nur al-Din took the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, and donning his own dress, went out to the bazar and walked about the city and took his pleasure therein, till he knew its highways and gates,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din, after donning his own dress and taking the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, fared forth to the market streets and wandered about a while till he knew every quarter of the city, after which he returned to the church[FN#518] and saw the Princess Miriam the Girdle-girl, daughter of the King of France come up to the fane, attended by four hundred damsels, high-bosomed maids like moons, amongst whom was the daughter of the one-eyed Wazir and those of the Emirs and Lords of the realm; and she walked in their midst as she were moon among stars. When his eyes fell upon her Nur al-Din could not contain himself, but cried out from the core of his heart, \"O Miriam! O Miriam!\" When the damsels heard his outcry they ran at him with swords shining bright like flashes of leven-light and would have slain him forthright. But the Princess turned and looking on him, knew him with fullest knowledge, and said to her maidens, \"Leave this youth; doubtless he is mad, for the signs of madness be manifest on his face.\" When Nur al-Din heard this, he uncovered his head and rolled his eyes and made signs with his hands and twisted his legs, foaming the while at the mouth. Quoth the Princess, \"Said I not that the poor youth was mad? Bring him to me and stand off from him, that I may hear what he saith; for I know the speech of the Arabs and will look into his case and see if his madness admit of cure or not.\" So they laid hold of him and brought him to her; after which they withdrew to a distance and she said to him, \"Hast thou come hither on my account and ventured thy life for my sake and feignest thyself mad?\" He replied, \"O my lady, hast thou not heard the saying of the poet?,[FN#519]\n\n'Quoth they, 'Thou'rt surely raving mad for her thou lov'st;' and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I, 'There is no pleasantness in life but for the mad,'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    reply.\nCompare my madness with herself for whom I rave; if she Accord\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   therewith, then blame me not for that which I aby.'\"\n\nMiriam replied, \"By Allah, O Nur al-Din, indeed thou hast sinned against thyself, for I warned thee of this before it befell thee: yet wouldst thou not hearken to me, but followest thine own lust: albeit that whereof I gave thee to know I learnt not by means of inspiration nor physiognomy[FN#520] nor dreams, but by eye-witness and very sight; for I saw the one-eyed Wazir and knew that he was not come to Alexandria but in quest of me.\" Said he, \"O my lady Miriam, we seek refuge with Allah from the error of the intelligent!\"[FN#521] Then his affliction redoubled on him and he recited this saying,[FN#522]\n\n\"Pass o'er my fault, for 'tis the wise man's wont\nOf other's sins to take no harsh account;\nAnd as all crimes have made my breast their site,\nSo thine all shapes of mercy should unite.\nWho from above would mercy seek to know,\nShould first be merciful to those below.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din and Princess Miriam ceased not from lovers' chiding which to trace would be tedious, relating each to other that which had befallen them and reciting verses and making moan, one to other, of the violence of passion and the pangs of pine and desire, whilst the tears ran down their cheeks like rivers, till there was left them no strength to say a word and so they continued till day deprated and night darkened. Now the Princess was clad in a green dress, purfled with red gold and broidered with pearls and gems which enhanced her beauty and loveliness and inner grace; and right well quoth the poet of her,[FN#523]\n\n\"Like the full moon she shineth in garments all of green, With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   loosened vest and collars and flowing hair beseen.\n'What is thy name?' I asked her, and she replied, 'I'm she Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen.\nI am the pure white silver, ay, and the gold wherewith The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bondsmen from strait prison and dour releas\u00e8d been.'\nQuoth I, 'I'm all with rigours consumed;' but 'On a rock,' Said\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  she, 'such as my heart is, thy plaints are wasted clean.'\n'Even if thy heart,' I answered, 'be rock in very deed, Yet hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  God caused fair water well from the rock, I ween.'\"\n\nAnd when night darkened on them the Lady Miriam went up to her women and asked them, \"Have ye locked the door?\"; and they answered, \"Indeed we have locked it.\" So she took them and went with them to a place called the hapel of the Lady Mary the Virgin, Mother of Light, because the Nazarenes hold that there are her heart and soul. The girls betook themselves to prayer for blessings from above and circuited all the church; and when they had made an end of their visitation, the Princess turned to them and said, \"I desire to pass the night alone in the Virgin's chapel and seek a blessing thereof, for that yearning after it hath betided me, by reason of my long absence in the land of the Moslems; and as for you, when ye have made an end of your visitation, do ye sleep whereso ye will.\" Replied they, \"With love and goodly gree: be it as thou wilt!\"; and leaving her alone in the chapel, dispersed about the church and slept. The Lady Miriam waited till they were out of sight and hearing, then went in search of Nur al-Din, whom she found sitting in a corner on live coals, awaiting her. He rose and kissed her hands and feet and she sat down and seated him by her side. Then she pulled off all that was upon her of raiment and ornaments and fine linen and taking Nur al-Din in her arms strained him to her bosom. And they ceased not, she and he, from kissing and clipping and strumming to the tune of \"hocus-pocus,\"[FN#524] saying the while, \"How short are the nights of Union and the nights of Disunion how long are they!\" and reciting these verses,\n\n\"O Night of Union, Time's virginal prized, * White star of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nights with auroral dyes,\nThou garrest Dawn after Noon to rise * Say art thou Kohl in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Morning's Eyes,\nOr wast thou Slumber to bleared eye lief?\nO Night of Parting, how long thy stay * Whose latest hours aye\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   the first portray,\nThis endless circle that noways may * Show breach till the coming\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   of Judgment-day,\nDay when dies the lover of parting-grief.\"[FN#525]\n\nAs they were in this mighty delight and joy engrossing they heard one of the servants of the Saint[FN#526] smite the gong[FN#527] upon the roof, to call the folk to the rites of their worship, and he was even as saith the poet,\n\n\"I saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway, * Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     made the Fawn[FN#528] at striking going so knowing, eh?'\nAnd to my soul, 'What smiting irketh thee the more\u2014 * Striking\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the gong or striking note of going,[FN#529] say?'\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Din and Miriam the Girdle-girl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and ornaments; but this was grievous to Nur al-Din, and his gladness was troubled; the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"I ceas\u00e8d not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   eyes down cast and bit the same with most emphatic bite;\nUntil we were in gloria[FN#530] and lay him down the spy * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sank his eyes within his brain declining further sight:\nAnd struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   like * Muezzin crying duty-prayers in Allah's book indite.\nThen rose she up right hastily and donned the dress she'd doffed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Sore fearing lest a shooting-star[FN#531] upon our heads\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   alight.\nAnd cried, 'O wish and will of me, O end of all my hopes! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Behold the morning comes to us in brightest whitest light.'\nI swear if but one day of rule were given to my life * And I were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     made an Emperor of majesty and might,\nAdown I'd break the buttresses of churches one and all * And by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    their slaughter rid the earth of every shaveling wight.\"\n\nThen the Lady Miriam pressed him to her bosom and kissed his cheek and asked him, \"O Nur al-Din, how long hast thou been in this town?\" \"Seven days.\" \"Hast thou walked about in it, and dost thou know its ways and issues and its sea-gates and land gates?\" \"Yes!\" \"Knowest thou the way to the offertory-chest[FN#532] of the church?\" \"Yes!\" \"Since thou knowest all this, as soon as the first third[FN#533] of the coming night is over, go to the offertory-chest and take thence what thou wishest and willest. Then open the door that giveth upon the tunnel[FN#534] leading to the sea, and go down to the harbour, where thou wilt find a little ship and ten men therein, and when the Rais shall see thee, he will put out his hand to thee. Give him thy hand and he will take thee up into the ship, and do thou wait there till I come to thee. But 'ware and have a care lest sleep overtake thee this night, or thou wilt repent whenas repentance shall avail thee naught.\" Then the Princess farewelled him and going forth from Nur al-Din, aroused from sleep her women and the rest of the damsels, with whom she betook herself to the church door and knocked; whereupon the ancient dame opened to her and she went forth and found the knights and varlets standing without. They brought her a dapple she-mule and she mounted: whereupon they raised over her head a canopy[FN#535] with curtains of silk, and the knights took hold of the mule's halter. Then the guards[FN#536] encompassed her about, drawn brand in hand, and fared on with her, followed by her, till they brought her to the palace of the King her father. Meanwhile, Nur al-Din abode concealed behind the curtain, under cover of which Miriam and he had passed the night, till it was broad day, when the main door was opened and the church became full of people. Then he mingled with the folk and accosted the old Prioress, the guardian[FN#537] of the shrine, who said to him, \"Where didst thou lie last night?\" Said he, \"In the town as thou badest me.\" Quoth she, \"O my son, thou hast done the right thing; for, hadst thou nighted in the Church, she had slain thee on the foulest wise.\" And quoth he, \"Praised be Allah who hath delivered me from the evil of this night!\" Then he busied himself with the service of the church and ceased not busying till day departed and night with darkness starkened when he arose and opened the offertory-chest and took thence of jewels whatso was light of weight and weighty of worth. Then he tarried till the first watch of the night was past, when he made his way to the postern of the tunnel and opening it, went forth, calling on Allah for protection, and ceased not faring on until, after finding and opening the door, he came to the sea. Here he discovered the vessel moored to the shore near the gate; and her skipper, a tall old man of comely aspect with a long beard, standing in the waist, his ten men being ranged before him. Nur al-Din gave him his hand, as Miriam had bidden him, and the captain took it and pulling him on board of the ship cried out to his crew, saying, \"Cast off the moorings and put out to sea with us, ere day break.\" Said one of the ten, \"O my lord the Captain, how shall we put out now, when the King hath notified us that to-morrow he will embark in this ship and go round about the sea, being fearful for his daughter Miriam from the Moslem thieves?\" But the Rais cried out at them saying, \"Woe to you, O accursed; Dare ye gainsay me and bandy words with me?\" So saying the old captain bared his blade and with it dealt the sailor who had spoken a thrust in the throat, that the steel came out gleaming from his nape; and quoth another of the sailors, \"What hath our comrade done of crime, that thou shouldst cut his throat?\" Thereupon the captain clapped hand to sword and smote the speaker's head, nor did he leave smiting the rest of the sailors till he had slain them all, one after other, and cast the ten bodies ashore. Then he turned to Nur al-Din and cried out at him with a terrible great cry, that made him tremble, saying, \"Go down and pull up the mooring-satke.\" Nur al-Din feared lest he should strike him also with the sword; so he sprang up and leapt ashore and pulling up the stake jumped aboard again, swiftlier than the dazzling leven. The captain ceased not to bid him do this and do that and tack and wear hither and thither and look at the stars, and Nur al-Din did all that he bade him, with heart a-quaking for affright; whilst he himself spread the sails, and the ship fared with the twain into the dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old skipper had made sail he drave the ship, aided by Nur al-Din, into the dashing sea before a favouring gale. Meanwhile, Nur al-Din held on to the tackle immersed in deep thought, and drowned in the sea of solicitude, knowing not what was hidden for him in the future; and whenever he looked at the captain, his heart quaked and he knew not whither the Rais went with him. He abode thus, preoccupied with care and doubt, till it was high day, when he looked at the skipper and saw him take hold of his long beard and pull at it, whereupon it came off in his hand and Nur al-Din, examining it, saw that it was but a false beard glued on. So he straitly considered that same Rais, and behold, it was the Princess Miriam, his mistress and the dearling of his heart, who had contrived to waylay the captain and slay him and skinned off his beard, which she had stuck on to her own face. At this Nur al-Din was transported for you, and his breast broadened and he marvelled at her prowess and the stoutness of her heart and said to her, \"Welcome, O my hope and my desire and the end of mine every wish!\" Then love and gladness agitated him and he made sure of winning to his hopes and his expectancy; wherefore he broke out into song and chanted these couplets,\n\n\"To all who unknown my love for the May * From whom Fate disjoins\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    me O say, I pray,\n'Ask my kith and kin of my love that aye * Ensweetens my verses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to lovely lay:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        For the loss of the tribesmen my life o'er sway!'\nTheir names when named heal all malady; * Cure and chase from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    heart every pain I dree:\nAnd my longings for love reach so high degree * That my Sprite is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     maddened each morn I see,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And am grown of the crowd to be saw and say.\nNo blame in them will I e'er espy: * No! nor aught of solace sans\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    them descry:\nYour love hath shot me with pine, and I * Bear in heart a flame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    that shall never die,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         But fire my liver with fiery ray.\nAll folk my sickness for marvel score * That in darkest night I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    wake evermore\nWhat ails them to torture this heart forlore * And deem right for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     loving my blood t' outpour:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          And yet\u2014how justly unjust are they!\nWould I wot who 'twas could obtain of you * To wrong a youth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     who's so fain of you:\nBy my life and by Him who made men of you * And the spy tell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     aught I complain of you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         He lies, by Allah, in foulest way!\nMay the Lord my sickness never dispel, * Nor ever my heart of its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pains be well,\nWhat day I regret that in love I fell * Or laud any land but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wherein ye dwell:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Wring my heart and ye will or make glad and gay!\nI have vitals shall ever be true to you * Though racked by the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rigours not new to you\nEre this wrong and this right I but sue to you: * Do what you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     will to thrall who to you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Shall ne'er grudge his life at your feet to lay.\"\n\nWhen Nur al-Din ceased to sing, the Princess Miriam marvelled at his song and thanked him therefor, saying, \"Whoso's case is thus it behoveth him to walk the ways of men and never do the deed of curs and cowards.\" Now she was stout of heart and cunning in the sailing of ships over the salt sea, and she knew all the winds and their shiftings and every course of the main. So Nur al-Din said, \"O my lady, hadst thou prolonged this case on me,[FN#538] I had surely died for stress of affright and chagrin, more by token of the fire of passion and love-longing and the cruel pangs of separation.\" She laughed at his speech and rising without stay or delay brought out somewhat of food and liquor; and they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves and made merry. Then she drew forth rubies and other gems and precious stones and costly trinkets of gold and silver and all manner things of price, light of weight and weighty of worth, which she had taken from the palace of her sire and his treasuries, and displayed them to Nur al-Din, who rejoiced therein with joy exceeding. All this while the wind blew fair for them and merrily sailed the ship nor ceased sailing till they drew near the city of Alexandria and sighted its landmarks, old and new, and Pompey's Pillar. When they made the port, Nur al-Din landed forthright and securing the ship to one of the Fulling-Stones,[FN#539] took somewhat of the treasures that Miriam had brought with her, and said to her, \"O my lady, tarry in the ship, against I return and carry thee up into the city in such way as I should wish and will.\" Quoth she, \"It behoveth that this be done quickly, for tardiness in affairs engendereth repentance.\" Quoth he, \"There is no tardiness in me;\" and, leaving her in the ship, went up into the city to the house of the druggist his father's old fried, to borrow of his wife for Miriam veil and mantilla, and walking boots and petticoat-trousers after the usage of the women of Alexandria, unknowing that there was appointed to betide him of the shifts of Time, the Father of Wonders, that which was far beyond his reckoning. Thus it befel Nur al-Din and Miriam the Girdle-girl; but as regards her sire the King of France, when he arose in the morning, he missed his daughter and questioned her women and her eunuchs of her. Answered they, \"O our lord, she went out last night, to go to Church and after that we have no tidings of her.\" But, as the King talked with them, behold, there arose so great a clamour of cries below the palace, that the place rang thereto, and he said, \"What may be the news?\" The folk replied, \"O King, we have found ten men slain on the sea-shore, and the royal yacht is missing. Moreover we saw the postern of the Church, which giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea, wide open; and the Moslem prisoner, who served in the Church, is missing.\" Quoth the King, \"An my ship be lost, without doubt or dispute.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the King of France missed his daughter they brought him tidings of her, saying, \"Thy yacht is lost\"; and he replied, \"An the craft be lost, without dispute or doubt my daughter is in it.\" So he summoned without stay or delay the Captain of the Port and cried out at him, saying, \"By the virtue[FN#540] of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, except thou and thy fighting men overtake my ship forthright and bring it back to me, with those who are therein, I will do thee die the foulest of deaths and make a terrible example of thee!\" Thereupon the captain went out from before him, trembling, and betook himself to the ancient dame of the Church, to whom said he, 'Heardest thou aught from the captive, that was with thee, anent his native land and what countryman he was?\" And she answered, \"He used to say, I come from the town of Alexandria.\" When the captain heard the old woman's words he returned forthright to the port and cried out to the sailors, \"Make ready and set sail.\" So they did his bidding and straightway putting out to sea, fared night and day till they sighted the city of Alexandria at the very time when Nur al-Din landed, leaving the Princess in the ship. They soon espied the royal yacht and knew her; so they moored their own vessel at a distance therefrom and putting off in a little frigate they had with them, which drew but two cubits of water and in which were an hundred fighting-men, amongst them the one-eyed Wazir (for that he was a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil and a wily thief, none could avail against his craft, as he were Abu Mohammed al-Batt\u00e1l[FN#541]), they ceased not rowing till they reached the bark and boarding her, all at once, found none therein save the Princess Miriam. So they took her and the ship, and returning to their own vessel, after they had landed and waited a long while,[FN#542] set sail forthright for the land of the Franks, having accomplished their errand, without a fight or even drawing sword. The wind blew fair for them and they sailed on, without ceasing and with all diligence, till they reached the city of France and landing with the Princess Miriam carried her to her father, who received her, seated on the throne of his Kingship. As soon as he saw her, he said to her, \"Woe to thee, O traitress! What ailed thee to leave the faith of thy fathers and forefathers and the safeguard of the Messiah, on whom is our reliance, and follow after the faith of the Vagrants,[FN#543] to wit, the faith of Al-Islam, the which arose with the sword against the Cross and the Images?\" Replied Miriam, \"I am not at fault, I went out by night to the church, to visit the Lady Mary and seek a blessing of her, when there fell upon me unawares a band of Moslem robbers, who gagged me and bound me fast and carrying me on board the barque, set sail with me for their own country. However, I beguiled them and talked with them of their religion, till they loosed my bonds; and ere I knew it thy men overtook me and delivered me. And by the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar and the Cross and the Crucified thereon, I rejoiced with joy exceeding in my release from them and my bosom broadened and I was glad for my deliverance from the bondage of the Moslems!\" Rejoined the King, \"Thou liest, O whore! O adultress! By the virtue of that which is revealed of prohibition and permission in the manifest Evangel,[FN#544] I will assuredly do thee die by the foulest of deaths and make thee the vilest of examples! Did it not suffice thee to do as thou didst the first time and put off thy lies upon us, but thou must return upon us with thy deceitful inventions?\" Thereupon the King bade kill her and crucify her over the palace gate; but, at that moment the one-eyed Wazir, who had long been enamoured of the Princess, came in to him and said, \"Ho King! saly her not, but give her to me to wife, and I will watch over her with the utmost warding, nor will I go in unto her, till I have built her a palace of solid stone, exceeding high of foundation, so no thieves may avail to climb up to its terrace-roof; and when I have made an end of building it, I will sacrifice thirty Moslems before the gate thereof, as an expiatory offering to the Messiah for myself and for her.\" The King granted his request and bade the priests and monks and patriarchs marry the Princess to him; so they did his bidding, whereupon he bade set about building a strong and lofty palace, befitting her rank and the workmen fell to work upon it. On this wise it betided the Princess Miriam and her sire and the one-eyed Wazir; but as regards Nur al-Din, when he came back with the petticoat-trousers and mantilla and walking boots and all the attire of Alexandrian women which he had borrowed of the druggist's wife, he \"found the air void and the fane afar[FN#545]\";\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Din, \"found the aire void[FN#546] and the fane afar,\" his heart sank within him and he wept floods of tears and recited these verses,[FN#547]\n\n\"The phantom of Soada came by nigh to wake me towards morning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     while my companions were sleeping in the desert:\nBut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    vacant, and the place of visitation distant.\"\n\nThen Nur al-Din walked on along the sea-shore and turned right and left, till he saw folk gathered together on the beach and heard them say, \"O Moslems, there remaineth no honour to Alexandria-city, since the Franks enter it and snatch away those who are therein and return to their own land, at their leisure[FN#548] nor pursued of any of the Moslems or fighters for the Faith!\" Quoth Nur al-Din to them, \"What is to do?\"; and quoth they, \"O my son, one of the ships of the Franks, full of armed men, came down but now upon the port and carried off a ship which was moored here, with her that was therein, and made unmolested for their own land.\" Nur al-Din fell down a-swoon, on hearing these words; and when he recovered they questioned him of his case and he told them all that had befallen him first and last; whereupon they all took to reviling him and railing at him, saying, \"Why couldst thou not bring her up into the town without mantilla and muffler?\" And all and each of the folk gave him some grievous word, berating him with sharp speech, and shooting at him some shaft or reproach, albeit one said, \"Let him be; that which hath befallen him sufficeth him,\" till he again fell down in a fainting-fit. And behold, at this moment, up came the old druggist, who, seeing the folk gathered together, drew near to learn what was the matter and found Nur al-Din lying a-swoon in their midst. So he sat down at his head and arousing him, said to him as soon as he recovered, \"O my son, what is this case in which I see thee?\" Nur al-Din said, \"O uncle, I had brought back in a barque my lost slave-girl from her father's city, suffering patiently all I suffered of perils and hardships; and when I came with her to this port, I made the vessel fast to the shore and leaving her therein, repaired to thy dwelling and took of thy consort what was needful for her, that I might bring her up into the town; but the Franks came and capturing barque and damsel made off unhindered, and returned to their own land.\" Now when the Shaykh, the druggist, heard this, the light in his eyes became night and he grieved with sore grieving for Nur al-Din and said to him, \"O my son, why didst thou not bring her out of the ship into the city without mantilla? But speech availeth not at this season; so rise, O my son, and come up with me to the city; haply Allah will vouchsafe thee a girl fairer than she, who shall console thee for her. Alhamdolillah-praised be Allah-who hath not made thee lose aught by her! Nay, thou hast gained by her. And bethink thee, O my son, that Union and Disunion are in the hands of the Most High King..\" Replied Nur al-Din, \"By Allah, O uncle, I can never be consoled for her loss nor will I ever leave seeking her, though on her account I drink the cup of death!\" Rejoined the druggist, \"O my son, and what art thou minded to do?\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"I am minded to return to the land of the Franks[FN#549] and enter the city of France and emperil myself there; come what may, loss of life or gain of life.\" Quoth the druggist, \"O my son, there is an old saw, 'Not always doth the crock escape the shock'; and if they did thee no hurt the first time, belike they will slay thee this time, more by token that they know thee now with full knowledge.\" Quoth Nur al-Din, \"O my uncle, let me set out and be slain for the love of her straightway and not die of despair for her loss by slow torments.\" Now as Fate determined there was then a ship in port ready to sail, for its passengers had made an end of their affairs[FN#550] and the sailors had pulled up the mooring-stakes, when Nur al-Din embarked in her. So they shook out their canvas and relying on the Compassionate, put out to sea and sailed many days, with fair wind and weather, till behold, they fell in with certain of the Frank cruisers, which were scouring those waters and seizing upon all ships they saw, in their fear for the King's daughter from the Moslem corsairs: and as often as they made prize of a Moslem ship, they carried all her people to the King of France, who put them to death in fulfilment of the vow he had vowed on account of his daughter Miriam. So, seeing the ship wherein was Nur al-Din they boarded her and taking him and the rest of the company prisoners, to the number of an hundred Moslems, carried them to the King and set them between his hands. He bade cut their throats. Accordingly they slaughtered them all forthwith, one after another, till there was none left but Nur al-Din, whom the headsman had left to the last, in pity of his tender age and slender shape. When the King saw him, he knew him right well and said to him, \"Art thou not Nur al-Din, who was with us before?\" Said he, \"I was never with thee: and my name is not Nur al-Din, but Ibrahim.\" Rejoined the King; \"Thou liest, thou art Nur al-Din, he whom I gave to the ancient dame the Prioress, to help her in the service of the church.\" But Nur al-Din replied, \"O my lord, my name is Ibrahim.\" Quoth the King, \"Wait a while,\" and bade his knights fetch the old woman forthright, saying, \"When she cometh and seeth thee, she will know an thou be Nur al-Din or not.\" At this juncture, behold, in came the one-eyed Wazir who had married the Princess and kissing the earth before the King said to him, \"Know, O King, that the palace is finished; and thou knowest how I vowed to the Messiah that, when I had made an end of building it, I would cut thirty Moslems' throats before its doors; wherefore I am come to take them of thee, that I may sacrifice them and so fulfil my vow to the Messiah. They shall be at my charge, by way of loan, and whenas there come prisoners to my hands, I will give thee other thirty in lieu of them.\" Replied the King, 'By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, I have but this one captive left!\" And he pointed to Nur al-Din, saying, \"Take him and slaughter him at this very moment and the rest I will send thee when there come to my hands other prisoners of the Moslems.\" Thereupon the one-eyed Wazir arose and took Nur al-Din and carried him to his palace, thinking to slaughter him on the threshold of the gate; but the painters said to him, \"O my lord, we have two days' painting yet to do: so bear with us and delay to cut the throat of this captive, till we have made an end of our work; haply by that time the rest of the thirty will come, so thou mayst despatch them all at one bout and accomplish thy vow in a single day.\" Thereupon the Wazir bade imprison Nur al-Din.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir bade imprison Nur al-Din, they carried him to the stables and left him there in chains, hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself; for indeed he saw death face to face. Now it fortuned, by the ordinance of Destiny and fore-ordained Fate, that the King had two stallions, own brothers,[FN#551] such as the Chosroe Kings might sigh in vain to possess themselves of one of them; they were called S\u00e1bik and L\u00e1hik[FN#552] and one of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome night. And all the Kings of the isles had said, \"Whoso stealeth us one of these stallions, we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and pearls and gems;\" but none could avail to steal them. Now one of them fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes;[FN#553] whereupon the King gathered together all the farriers in the city to treat him; but they all failed of his cure. Presently the Wazir came into the King; and finding him troubled because of the horse, thought to do away his concern and said to him, \"O King, give me the stallion and I will cure him,\" The King consented and caused carry the horse to the stable wherein Nur al-Din lay chained; but, when he missed his brother, he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed, so that he affrighted all the folk. The Wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the King, who said, \"If this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?\" And he bade his grooms take the other horse and put him with his brother in the Wazir's stables, saying, \"Tell the Minister that the two stallions be a gift from me to him, for the sake of my daughter Miriam.\" Nur al-Din was lying in the stable, chained and shackled, when they brought in the two stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes. Now he had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases; so he said to himself, \"This by Allah is my opportunity! I will go to the Wazir and lie to him, saying, 'I will heal thee this horse': then will I do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes, and he will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life.\" So he waited till the Wazir entered the stable, to look upon the steed, and said to him, \"O my lord, what will be my due, an I heal this horse, and make his eyes whole again?\" Replied the Wazir, \"As my head liveth, an thou cure him, I will spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me!\" And Nur al-Din said, \"O my lord, bid my hands be unbound!\" So the Wazir bade unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass,[FN#554] brayed it and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onion-juice. Then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up, saying in himself, \"Now will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life.\" Then he passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty[FN#555] of cark and care, humbling himself to Allah the Most High and saying, \"O Lord, in Thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with asking and craving!\" Now when the morning morrowed and the sun shone, the Wazir came to the stable and, loosing the bandage from the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than before, by the ordinance of the King who openeth evermore. So he said to Nur al-Din, \"O Moslem, never in the world saw I the like of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge. By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou makest me with wonder to admire, for all the farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse!\" Then he went up to Nur al-Din and, doing off his shackles with his own hand, clad him in a costly dress and made him his master of the Horse; and he appointed him stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables. So Nur al-Din abode awhile, eating and drinking and making merry and bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses; and whoso neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service, he would thrown down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron. Furthermore, he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand, by reason of that which he knew of their value in the Wazir's eyes and his love for them; wherefore the Minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast broadened and he was right glad, unknowing what was to be the issue of his case. Now in the new palace, which the one-eyed Wazir had bought for Princess Miriam, was a lattice-window overlooking his old house and the flat wherein Nur al-Din lodged. The Wazir had a daughter, a virgin of extreme loveliness, as she were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet, and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold, she heard Nur al-Din, singing and solacing himself under his sorrows by improvising these verses,\n\n\"O my Censor who wakest a-morn to see * The joys of life and its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    jubilee!\nHad the fangs of Destiny bitten thee * In such bitter case thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    hadst pled this plea,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nBut from Fate's despight thou art safe this day;- * From her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    falsest fay and her crying 'Nay!'\nYet blame him not whom his woes waylay * Who distraught shall say\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    in his agony,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nExcuse such lovers in flight abhorr'd * Nor to Love's distreses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thine aid afford:\nLest thy self be bound by same binding cord * And drink of Love's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bitterest injury.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nIn His service I wont as the days went by * With freest heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   through the nights to lie;\nNor tasted wake, nor of Love aught reckt * Ere my heart to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   subjection summoned he:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nNone weet of Love and his humbling wrong * Save those he sickened\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   so sore, so long,\nWho have lost their wits 'mid the lover-throng * Draining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  bitterest cup by his hard decree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow oft in Night's gloom he cause wake to rue * Lovers' eyne, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     from eyelids their sleep withdrew;\nTill tears to the railing of torrents grew, * Overflowing cheeks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    , unconfined and free:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow many a man he has joyed to steep * In pain, and for pine hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     he plundered sleep,\u2014\nMade don garb of mourning the deepest deep * And even his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dreaming forced to flee:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'\nHow oft sufferance fails me!

So she went to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down her cheeks; and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she recited these couplets,\n\n\"My life is gone but love-longings remain * And my breast is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    straitened with pine and pain:\nAnd my heart for parting to melt is fain * Yet hoping that union\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    will come again,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And join us in one who now are twain.\nStint your blame to him who in heart's your thrall * With the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wasted frame which his sorrows gall,\nNor with aim of arrow his heart appal * For parted lover is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   saddest of all,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And Love's cup of bitters is sweet to drain!\"\n\nQuoth the Wazir's daughter to her, \"What aileth thee, O Princess, to be thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought?\" Whereupon Miriam recalled the greatness of the delights that were past and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"I will bear in patience estrangement of friend * And on cheeks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rail tears that like torrents wend:\nHaply Allah will solace my sorrow, for He * Neath the ribs of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     unease maketh ease at end.\"\n\nSaid the Wazir's daughter, \"O Princess, let not thy breast be straitened, but come with me straightway to the lattice; for there is with us in the stable[FN#556] a comely young man, slender of shape and sweet of speech, and meseemeth he is a parted lover.\" Miriam asked, \"And by what sign knowest thou that he is a parted lover?\"; and she answered, \"O Queen, I know it by his improvising odes and verses all watches of the night and tides of the day.\" Quoth the Princess in herself, \"If what the Wazir's daughter says be true, these are assuredly the traits of the baffled, the wretched Ali Nur al-Din. Would I knew if indeed he be the youth of whom she speaketh.\" At this thought, love-longing and distraction of passion redoubled on her and she rose at once and walking with the maiden to the lattice, looked down upon the stables, where she saw her love and lord Nur al-Din and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him, knew him with the bestest knowledge of love, albeit he was sick, of the greatness of his affection for her and of the fire of passion, and the anguish of separation and yearning and distraction. Sore upon him was emaciation and he was improvising and saying,\n\n\"My heart is a thrall; my tears ne'er abate * And their rains the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     railing of clouds amate;\n'Twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love; * And whining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and pining for dearest mate.\nAh my burning heat, my desire, my lowe! * For the plagues that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    torture my heart are eight;\nAnd five upon five are in suite of them; * So stand and listen to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     all I state:\nMem'ry, madding thoughts, moaning languishment, * Stress of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  longing love, plight disconsolate;\nIn travail, affliction and strangerhood, * And annoy and joy when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    on her I wait.\nFail me patience and stay for engrossing care * And sorrows my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    suffering soul regrate.\nOn my heart the possession of passion grows * O who ask of what\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   fire in my heart's create,\nWhy my tears in vitals should kindle flame, * Burning heart with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ardours insatiate,\nKnow, I'm drowned in Deluge[FN#557] of tears and my soul * From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Laz\u00e1-lowe fares to H\u00e1wiyah-goal.\"[FN#558]\n\nWhen the Princess Miriam beheld Nur al-Din and heard his loquence and verse and speech, she made certain that it was indeed her lord Nur al-Din; but she concealed her case from the Wazir's daughter and said to her, \"By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, I thought not thou knewest of my sadness!\" Then she arose forthright and withdrawing from the window, returned to her own place, whilst the Wazir's daughter went to her own occupations. The Princess awaited patiently awhile, then returned to the window and sat there, gazing upon her beloved Nur al-Din and delighting her eyes with his beauty and inner and outer grace.

See vol. i. 83; where it applies to oranges and citrons.\n\n[FN#397] 'Andam = Dragon's blood: see vol. iii. 263.\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Jam\u00e1r,\" the palm-pith and cabbage, both eaten by\nArabs with sugar.\n\n[FN#399] Arab. \"Anw\u00e1r\" = lights, flowers (mostly yellow): hence the Moroccan \"N'w\u00e1r,\" with its usual abuse of Wakf or quiescence.\n\n[FN#400] Mr. Payne quotes Eugene From\u00e8ntin, \"Un Et\u00e9 dans le Sahara,\" Paris, 1857, p. 194. Apricot drying can be seen upon all the roofs at Damascus where, however, the season for each fruit is unpleasantly short, ending almost as soon as it begins.\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Jal\u00e1jal\" = small bells for falcons: in Port. cascaveis, whence our word.\n\n[FN#402] Khulanj\u00e1n. Sic all editions; but Khalanj, or Khaulanj adj. Khalanji, a tree with a strong-smelling wood which held in hand as a chaplet acts as perfume, as is probably intended. In Span. Arabic it is the Erica-wood. The \"Muhit\" tells us that is a tree parcel yellow and red growing in parts of India and China, its leaf is that of the Tamarisk (Tarf\u00e1); its flower is coloured red, yellow and white; it bears a grain like mustard-seed (Khardal) and of its wood they make porringers. Hence the poet sings,\n\n\"Yut 'amu 'l-shahdu f\u00ed 'l-jif\u00e1ni, wa yuska * Labanu 'l-Bukhti fi\nKus\u00e1'i 'l-Khalanji:\nHoney's served to them in platters for food; * Camels' milk in\nbowls of the Khalanj wood.\"\nThe pl. Khal\u00e1nij is used by Himy\u00e1n bin Kah\u00e1fah in this \"bayt\",\n\n\"Hatt\u00e1 iz\u00e1 m\u00e1 qazati 'l-Haw\u00e1ij\u00e1 * Wa malaat Hal\u00e1ba-h\u00e1\n'l-Khal\u00e1nij\u00e1:\nUntil she had done every work of hers * And with sweet milk had\nfilled the porringers.\"\n[FN#403] In text Al-Sh\u00e1'ir Al-Walah\u00e1n, vol. iii. 226.\n\n[FN#404] The orange I have said is the growth of India and the golden apples of the Hesperides were not oranges but probably golden nuggets. Captain Rolleston (Globe, Feb. 5, '84, on \"Morocco-Lixus\") identifies the Garden with the mouth of the Lixus River while M. Antichan would transfer it to the hideous and unwholesome Bissagos Archipelago.\n\n[FN#405] Arab. \"Iky\u00e1n,\" the living gold which is supposed to grow in the ground.\n\n[FN#406] For the Kubbad or Captain Shaddock's fruit see vol. ii. 310, where it is misprinted Kub\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#407] Full or Fill in Bresl. Edit. = Arabian jessamine or cork-tree ( ). The Bul. and Mac. Edits. read \"filfil\" = pepper or palm-fibre.\n\n[FN#408] Arab. \"Sumbul al-'Anbari\"; the former word having been introduced into England by patent medicines. \"Sumbul\" in Arab. and Pers. means the hyacinth, the spikenard or the Sign Virgo.\n\n[FN#409] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1n al-Hamal\" lit. = Lamb's tongue.\n\n[FN#410] See in Bresl. Edit. X, 221. Taif, a well-known town in the mountain region East of Meccah, and not in the Holy Land, was once famous for scented goat's leather. It is considered to be a \"fragment of Syria\" (Pilgrimage ii. 207) and derives its name = the circumambulator from its having circuited pilgrim-like round Ka'abah (Ibid.).\n\n[FN#411] Arab. \"Mikhaddah\" = cheek-pillow: Ital. guanciale. In\nBresl. Edit. Mudawwarah (a round cushion) Sinjabiyah (of Ermine).\nFor \"Mudawwarah\" see vol. iv. 135.\n\n[FN#412] \"Coffee\" is here evidently an anachronism and was probably inserted by the copyist. See vol. v. 169, for its first metnion. But \"Kahwah\" may have preserved its original meaning = strong old wine (vol. ii. 261); and the amount of wine-drinking and drunkenness proves that the coffee movement had not set in.\n\n[FN#413] i.e. they are welcome. In Marocco \"L\u00e1 baas\" means, \"I am pretty well\" (in health).\n\n[FN#414] The Rose (Ward) in Arab. is masculine, sounding to us most uncouth. But there is a fem. form Wardah = a single rose.\n\n[FN#415] Arab. \"Akm\u00e1m,\" pl. of Kumm, a sleeve, a petal. See vol. iv. 107 and supra p. 267. The Moslem woman will show any part of her person rather than her face, instinctively knowing that the latter may be recognised whereas the former cannot. The traveller in the outer East will see ludicrous situations in which the modest one runs away with hind parts bare and head and face carefully covered.\n\n[FN#416] Arab. \"Iky\u00e1n\" which Mr. Payne translates \"vegetable gold\" very picturesquely but not quite preserving the idea. See supra p. 272.\n\n[FN#417] It is the custom for fast youths, in Egypt, Syria, and elsewhere to stick small gold pieces, mere spangles of metal on the brows, cheeks and lips of the singing and dancing girls and the perspiration and mask of cosmetics make them adhere for a time till fresh movement shakes them off.\n\n[FN#418] See the same idea in vol. i. 132, and 349.\n\n[FN#419] \"They will ask thee concerning wine and casting of lots; say: 'In both are great sin and great advantages to mankind; but the sin of them both is greater than their advantage.'\" See Koran ii. 216. Mohammed seems to have made up his mind about drinking by slow degrees; and the Koranic law is by no means so strict as the Mullahs have made it. The prohibitions, revealed at widely different periods and varying in import and distinction, have been discussed by Al-Bayz\u00e1wi in his commentary on the above chapter. He says that the first revelation was in chapt. xvi. 69 but, as the passage was disregarded, Omar and others consulted the Apostle who replied to them in chapt. ii. 216. Then, as this also was unnoticed, came the final decision in chapt. v. 92, making wine and lots the work of Satan. Yet excuses are never wanting to the Moslem, he can drink Champagne and Cognac, both unknown in Mohammed's day and he can use wine and spirits medicinally, like sundry of ourselves, who turn up the nose of contempt at the idea of drinking for pleasure.\n\n[FN#420] i.e. a fair-faced cup-bearer. The lines have occurred before: so I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#421] It is the custom of the Arabs to call their cattle to water by whistling; not to whistle to them, as Europeans do, whilst making water.\n\n[FN#422] i.e. bewitching. See vol. i. 85. These incompatible metaphors are brought together by the Saj'a (prose rhyme) in\u2014\"iyah.\"\n\n[FN#423] Mesopotamian Christians, who still turn towards Jerusalem, face the West, instead of the East, as with Europeans: here the monk is so dazed that he does not know what to do.\n\n[FN#424] Arab. \"Bayt Sha'ar\" = a house of hair (tent) or a couplet of verse. Watad (a tentpeg) also is prosodical, a foot when the two first letters are \"moved\" (vowelled) and the last is jazmated (quiescent), e.g. Lakad. It is termed Majm\u00fa'a (united), as opposed to \"Mafr\u00fak\" (separated), e.g. Kabla, when the \"moved\" consonants are disjoined by a quiescent.\n\n[FN#425] Lit. standing on their heads, which sounds ludicrous enough in English, not in Arabic.\n\n[FN#426] These lines are in vol. iii. 251. I quote Mr. Payne who notes \"The bodies of Eastern women of the higher classes by dint of continual maceration, Esther-fashion, in aromatic oils and essences, would naturally become impregnated with the sweet scents of the cosmetics used.\"\n\n[FN#427] These lines occur in vol. i. 218: I quote Torrens for variety.\n\n[FN#428] So we speak of a \"female screw.\" The allusion is to the dove-tailing of the pieces. This personification of the lute has occurred before: but I solicit the reader's attention to it; it has a fulness of Oriental flavour all its own.\n\n[FN#429] I again solicit the reader's attention to the simplicity, the pathos and the beauty of this personification of the lute.\n\n[FN#430] \"They\" for she.\n\n[FN#431] The Arabs very justly make the \"'Andalib\" = nightingale, masculine.\n\n[FN#432] Anw\u00e1r = lights or flowers: See Night dccclxv. supra p. 270.\n\n[FN#433] These couplets have occurred in vol. i. 168; so I quote\nMr. Payne.\n[FN#434] i.e. You may have his soul but leave me his body: company with him in the next world and let me have him in this.\n\n[FN#435] Alluding to the Koranic (cxiii. 1.), \"I take refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak from the mischief of that which He hath created, etc.\" This is shown by the first line wherein occurs the Koranic word \"Gh\u00e1sik\" (cxiii. 3) which may mean the first darkness when it overspreadeth or the moon when it is eclipsed.\n\n[FN#436] \"Malak\" = level ground; also tract on the Nile sea.\nLane M.E. ii. 417, and Bruckhardt Nubia 482.\n\n[FN#437] This sentiment has often been repeated.\n\n[FN#438] The owl comes in because \"B\u00fam\" (pron. boom) rhymes with\nKayy\u00fam = the Eternal.\n\n[FN#439] For an incident like this see my Pilgrimmage (vol. i. 176). How true to nature the whole scene is; the fond mother excusing her boy and the practical father putting the excuse aside. European paternity, however, would probably exclaim, \"The beast's in liquor!\"\n\n[FN#440] In ancient times this seems to have been the universal and perhaps instinctive treatment of the hand that struck a father. By Nur al-Din's flight the divorce-oath became technically null and void for Taj al-Din had sworn to mutilate his son next morning.\n\n[FN#441] So Roderic Random and his companions \"sewed their money between the lining and the waistband of their breeches, except some loose silver for immediate expense on the road.\" For a description of these purses see Pilgrimage i. 37.\n\n[FN#442] Arab. Rashid (our Rosetta), a corruption of the Coptic\nTrashit; ever famous for the Stone.\n\n[FN#443] For a parallel passage in praise of Alexandria see vol. i. 290, etc. The editor or scribe was evidently an Egyptian.\n\n[FN#444] Arab. \"Saghr\" (Thagr), the opening of the lips showing the teeth. See vol. i. p. 156.\n\n[FN#445] Iskandariyah, the city of Iskandar or Alexander the Great, whose \"Soma\" was attractive to the Greeks as the corpse of the Prophet Daniel afterwards was to the Moslems. The choice of site, then occupied only by the pauper village of Rhacotis, is one proof of many that the Macedonian conqueror had the inspiration of genius.\n\n[FN#446] i.e. paid them down. See vol. i. 281; vol. ii. 145.\n\n[FN#447] Arab. \"Baltiyah,\" Sonnini's \"Bolti\" and N\u00e9buleux (because it is dozid-coloured when fried), the Labrus Niloticus from its labra or large fleshy lips. It lives on the \"leaves of Paradise\" hence the flesh is delicate and savoury and it is caught with the \u00e9pervier or sweep-net in the Nile, canals and pools.\n\n[FN#448] Arab. \"Liyyah,\" not a delicate comparison, but exceedingly apt besides rhyming to \"Baltiyah.\" The cauda of the \"five-quarter sheep, whose tails are so broad and thick that there is as much flesh upon them as upon a quarter of their body,\" must not be confounded with the lank appendage of our English muttons. See i. 25, Dr. Burnell's Linschoten (Hakluyt Soc. 1885).\n\n[FN#449] A variant occurs in vol. ix. 191.\n\n[FN#450] Arab. \"Tars Daylami,\" a small shield of bright metal.\n\n[FN#451] Arab. \"Kaukab al-durri,\" see Pilgrimage ii. 82.\n\n[FN#452] Arab. \"Kus\u00faf\" applied to the moon; Khus\u00faf being the solar eclipse.\n\n[FN#453] May Ab\u00fa Lahab's hands perish. . . and his wife be a bearer of faggots!\" Korau cxi. 184. The allusion is neat.\n\n[FN#454] Alluding to the Angels who shoot down the Jinn. See vol. i. 224. The index misprints \"Shib\u00e1h.\"\n\n[FN#455] For a similar scene see Ali Shar and Zumurrud, vol. iv. 187.\n\n[FN#456] i.e. of the girl whom as the sequel shows, her owner had promised not to sell without her consent. This was and is a common practice. See vol. iv. 192.\n\n[FN#457] These lines have occurred in vol. iii. p. 303. I quote\nMr. Payne.\n\n[FN#458] Alluding to the erectio et distensio penis which comes on before dawn in tropical lands and which does not denote any desire for women. Some Anglo-Indians term the symptom signum salutis, others a urine-proud pizzle.\n\n[FN#459] Arab. \"Mohtasib,\" in the Maghrib \"Mohtab,\" the officer charged with inspecting weights and measures and with punishing fraud in various ways such as nailing the cheat's ears to his shop's shutter, etc.\n\n[FN#460] Every where in the Moslem East the slave holds himself superior to the menial freeman, a fact which I would impress upon the several Anti-slavery Societies, honest men whose zeal mostly exceeds their knowledge, and whose energy their discretion.\n\n[FN#461] These lines, extended to three couplets, occur in vol. iv. 193. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#462] \"At this examination (on Judgment Day) Mohammedans also believe that each person will have the book, wherein all the actions of his life are written, delivered to him; which books the righteous will receive in their right hand, and read with great pleasure and satisfaction; but the ungodly will be obliged to take them, against their wills, in their left (Koran xvii. xviii. lxix, and lxxxiv.), which will be bound behind their backs, their right hand being tied to their necks.\" Sale, Preliminary Discourse; Sect. iv.\n\n[FN#463] \"Whiteness\" (bay\u00e1z) also meaning lustre, honour.\n\n[FN#464] This again occurs in vol. iv. 194. So I quote Mr.\nPayne.\n\n[FN#465] Her impudence is intended to be that of a captive\nPrincess.\n\n[FN#466] i.e. bent groundwards.\n\n[FN#467] See vol. iv. 192. In Marocco Za'ar is applied to a man with fair skin, red hair and blue eyes (Gothic blood?) and the term is not complimentary as \"Sultan Yazid Za'ar.\"\n\n[FN#468] The lines have occurred before (vol. iv. 194). I quote Mr. Lane ii. 440. Both he and Mr. Payne have missed the point in \"ba'zu lay\u00e1li\" a certain night when his mistress had left him so lonely.\n\n[FN#469] Arab. \"Raat-hu.\" This apparently harmless word suggests one simlar in sound and meaning which gave some trouble in its day. Says Mohammed in the Koran (ii. 98) \"O ye who believe! say not (to the Apostle) R\u00e1'in\u00e1 (look at us) but Unzurn\u00e1 (regard us).\" \"R\u00e1'in\u00e1\" as pronounced in Hebrew means \"our bad one.\"\n\n[FN#470] By reason of its leanness.\n\n[FN#471] In the Mac. Edit. \"Fifty.\" For a scene which illustrates this mercantile transaction see my Pilgrimage i. 88, and its deduction. \"How often is it our fate, in the West as in the East, to see in bright eyes and to hear from rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed 'Why don't you buy me?' or, worse still, 'Why can't you buy me?'\"\n\n[FN#472] See vol. ii. 165 dragging or trailing the skirts = walking without the usual strut or swagger: here it means assuming the humble manners of a slave in presence of the master.\n\n[FN#473] This is the Moslem form of \"boycotting\": so amongst early Christians they refused to give one another God-speed. Amongst Hind\u00fas it takes the form of refusing \"Hukkah (pipe) and water\" which practically makes a man an outcast. In the text the old man expresses the popular contempt for those who borrow and who do not repay. He had evidently not read the essay of Elia on the professional borrower.\n\n[FN#474] See note p. 273.\n\n[FN#475] i.e. the best kind of camels.\n\n[FN#476] This first verse has occurred three times.\n\n[FN#477] Arab. \"Surayy\u00e1\" in Dictionaries a dim. of Sarw\u00e1 = moderately rich. It may either denote abundance of rain or a number of stars forming a constellation. Hence in Job (xxxviii. 31) it is called a heap (k\u00edmah).\n\n[FN#478] Pleiads in Gr. the Stars whereby men sail.\n\n[FN#479] This is the Eastern idea of the consequence of satisfactory coition which is supposed to be the very seal of love. Westerns have run to the other extreme.\n\n[FN#480] \"Al-R\u00edf\" simply means lowland: hence there is a R\u00edf in the Nile-delta. The word in Europe is applied chiefly to the Maroccan coast opposite Gibraltar (not, as is usually supposed the North-Western seaboard) where the Berber-Shilh\u00e1 race, so famous as the \"Rif pirates\" still closes the country to travellers.\n\n[FN#481] i.e. Upper Egypt.\n\n[FN#482] These local excellencies of coition are described jocosely rather than anthropologically.\n\n[FN#483] See vol. i. 223: I take from Torrens, p. 223.\n\n[FN#484] For the complete ablution obligatory after copulation before prayers can be said. See vol. vi. 199.\n\n[FN#485] Arab. \"Zunn\u00e1r,\" the Greek , for which, see vol. ii. 215.\n\n[FN#486] Miriam (Arabic Maryam), is a Christian name, in Moslem lands. Ab\u00fa Maryam \"Mary's father\" (says Motarrazi on Al-Hariri, Ass. of Alexandria) is a term of contempt, for men are called after sons (e.g. Abu Zayd), not after daughters. In more modern authors Abu Maryam is the name of ushers and lesser officials in the Kazi's court.\n\n[FN#487] This formality, so contrary to our Western familiarity after possession, is an especial sign of good breeding amongst Arabs and indeed all Eastern nations. It reminds us of the \"grand manner\" in Europe two hundred years ago, not a trace of which now remains.\n\n[FN#488] These lines are in Night i. ordered somewhat differently: so I quote Torrens (p. 14).\n\n[FN#489] i.e. to the return Sal\u00e1m\u2014\"And with thee be peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!\" See vol. ii. 146. The enslaved Princess had recognised her father's Wazir and knew that he could have but one object, which being a man of wit and her lord a \"raw laddie,\" he was sure to win.\n\n[FN#490] It is quite in Moslem manners for the bystanders to force the sale seeing a silly lad reject a most advantageous offer for sentimental reasons. And the owner of the article would be bound by their consent.\n\n[FN#491] Arab. \"Wa'llahi.\" \"Bi\" is the original particle of swearing, a Harf al-jarr (governing the genitive as Bi'll\u00e1hi) and suggesting the idea of adhesion: \"Wa\" (noting union) is its substitute in oath-formul\u00e6 and \"Ta\" takes the place of Wa as Ta'll\u00e1hi. The three-fold forms are combined in a great \"swear.\"\n\n[FN#492] i.e. of divorcing their own wives.\n\n[FN#493] These lines have occurred before: I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#494] These lines are in Night xxvi., vol. i. 275: I quote\nTorrens (p. 277), with a correction for \"when ere.\"\n\n[FN#495] This should be \"draws his senses from him as one pulls hair out of paste.\"\n\n[FN#496] R\u00e1ghib and Z\u00e1hid: see vol. v. 141.\n\n[FN#497] Carolus Magnus then held court in Paris; but the text evidently alludes to one of the port-cities of Provence as Marseille which we English will miscall Marseilles.\n\n[FN#498] Here the writer, not the young wife, speaks; but as a tale-teller he says \"hearer\"not \"reader.\"\n\n[FN#499] Kayraw\u00e1n, the Arab. form of the Greek Cyrene which has lately been opened to travellers and has now lost the mystery which enschrouded it. In Hafiz and the Persian poets it is the embodiment of remoteness and secrecy; as we till the last quarter century spoke of the \"deserts of Central Africa.\"\n\n[FN#500] Arab. \"'Inn\u00edn\": alluding to all forms of impotence, from dislike, natural deficiency or fascination, the favourite excuse. Easterns seldom attribute it to the true cause, weak action of the heart; but the Romans knew the truth when they described one of its symptoms as cold feet. \"Clino-pedalis, ad venerem invalidus, ab ea antiqua opinione, frigiditatem pedum concubituris admondum officere.\" Hence St. Francis and the bare-footed Friars. See Glossarium Eroticum Linguae Latin\u00e6, Parisiis, Dondey-Dupr\u00e9, MDCCCXXVI.\n\n[FN#501] I have noted the use of \"island\" for \"land\" in general. So in the European languages of the sixteenth century, insula was used for peninsula, e.g. Insula de Cori = the Corean peninsula.\n\n[FN#502] As has been noticed (vol. i. 333), the monocular is famed for mischief and men expect the mischief to come from his blinded eye.\n\n[FN#503] Here again we have a specimen of \"inverted speech\" (vol. ii. 265); abusive epithets intended for a high compliment, signifying that the man was a tyrant over rebels and a froward devil to the foe.\n\n[FN#504] Arab. \"Bab al-Bahr,\" see vol. iii. 281.\n\n[FN#505] Arab. \"Bat\u00e1rikah\" see vol. ii. 89. The Templars, Knights of Malta and other orders half ecclesiastic, half military suggested the application of the term.\n\n[FN#506] These lines have occurred in vol. i. 280\u2014I quote\nTorrens (p. 283).\n\n[FN#507] Maryam al-Husn containing a double entendre, \"O place of the white doe (R\u00edm) of beauty!\" The girl's name was Maryam the Arab. form of Mary, also applied to the B.V. by Eastern Christians. Hence a common name of Syrian women is \"Husn Maryam\" = (one endowed with the spiritual beauties of Mary: vol. iv. 87). I do not think that the name was \"manufactured by the Arab story-tellers after the pattern of their own names (e.g. Nur al-Din or Noureddin, light of the faith, Tajeddin, crown of faith, etc.) for the use of their imaginary Christian female characters.\"\n\n[FN#508] I may here remind readers that the B\u00e1n, which some Orientalists will write \"Ben,\" is a straight and graceful species of Moringa with plentiful and intensely green foliage.\n\n[FN#509] Arab. \"Am\u00fad al-Saw\u00e1ri\" = the Pillar of Masts, which is still the local name of Diocletian's column absurdly named by Europeans \"Pompey's Pillar.\"\n\n[FN#510] Arab. \"Batiyah,\" also used as a wine-jar (amphora), a flagon.\n\n[FN#511] Arab. \"Al-Kurs\u00e1n,\" evidently from the Ital. \"Corsaro,\" a runner. So the Port. \"Cabo Corso,\" which we have corrupted to \"Cape Coast Castle\" (Gulf of Guinea), means the Cape of Tacking.\n\n[FN#512] Arab. \"Ghur\u00e1b,\" which Europeans turn to \"Grab.\"\n\n[FN#513] Arab. \"Sayyib\" (Thayyib) a rare word: it mostly applies to a woman who leaves her husband after lying once with him.\n\n[FN#514] Arab. \"Bat\u00e1rikah:\" here meaning knights, leaders of armed men as in Night dccclxii., supra p. 256, it means \"monks.\"\n\n[FN#515] i.e. for the service of a temporal monarch.\n\n[FN#516] Arab. \"Sayr\" = a broad strip of leather still used by way of girdle amongst certain Christian religions in the East.\n\n[FN#517] Arab. \"Hal\u00e1wat al-Sal\u00e1mah,\" the sweetmeats offered to friends after returning from a journey or escaping sore peril. See vol. iv. 60.\n\n[FN#518] So Eginhardt was an Erzcapellan and belonged to the ghostly profession.\n\n[FN#519] These lines are in vols. iii. 258 and iv. 204. I quote\nMr. Payne.\n\n[FN#520] Arab. \"Fir\u00e1sah,\" lit. = skill in judging of horse flesh\n(Faras) and thence applied, like \"Kiy\u00e1fah,\" to physiognomy. One\nK\u00e1ri was the first to divine man's future by worldly signs\n(Al-Mayd\u00e1ni, Arab. prov. ii. 132) and the knowledge was\nhereditary in the tribe Mash\u00edj.\n\n[FN#521] Reported to be a \"Hadis\" or saying of Mohammed, to whom are attributed many such shrewd aphorisms, e.g. \"Allah defend us from the ire of the mild (tempered).\"\n\n[FN#522] These lines are in vol. i. 126. I quote Torrens (p. 120).\n\n[FN#523] These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#524] Arab. \"Kh\u00e1k-b\u00e1k,\" an onomatopia like our flip-flap and a host of similar words. This profaning a Christian Church which contained the relics of the Virgin would hugely delight the coffee-house habitu\u00e9s, and the Egyptians would be equally flattered to hear that the son of a Cairene merchant had made the conquest of a Frankish Princess Royal.

And yet the new creed was at once accepted by whole regions of Christians, and Mauritania, which had rejected Roman paganism and Gothic Christianity. This was e.g. Syria and the so-called \"Holy Land,\" not because, as is fondly asserted by Christians, al-Islam was forced upon them by the sword, but on account of its fulfilling a need, its supplying a higher belief, unity as opposed to plurality, and its preaching a more manly attitude of mind and a more sensible rule of conduct. Arabic still preserves a host of words special to the Christian creed; and many of them have been adopted by Moslems but with changes of signification.\n\n[FN#544] i.e. of things commanded and things prohibited.

Zaj \u00e1j bears, however, the meaning of clove-nails (the ripe bud of the clove-shrub) and may possibly apply to one of the manifold \"Alf\u00e1z Adwiyh\" (names of drugs). Here, however, pounded glass would be all sufficient to blind a horse: it is much used in the East especially for dogs affected by intestinal vermicules.\n\n[FN#555] Alluding to the Arab saying \"The two rests\"\n(Al-r\u00e1hat\u00e1ni) \"certainty of success or failure,\" as opposed to\n\"Wisw\u00e1s\" when the mind fluctuates in doubt.\n\n[FN#556] She falls in love with the groom, thus anticipating the noble self-devotion of Miss Aurora Floyd.\n\n[FN#557] Arab. \"T\u00faf\u00e1n\" see vol. v. 156: here it means the\n\"Deluge of Noah.\"\n\n[FN#558] Two of the Hells. See vol. v. 240.\n\n[FN#559] Lit. \"Out upon a prayer who imprecated our parting!\"\n\n[FN#560] The use of masculine for feminine has frequently been noted.

Change of Fortune\n\nThen he had taken his place behind the other passengers in the front of the diligence, and when the vehicle began to shake as the five horses started into a brisk trot all at the same time, he allowed himself to plunge into an intoxicating dream of the future. Like an architect drawing up the plan of a palace, he mapped out his life beforehand. He filled it with dainties and with splendours; it rose up to the sky; a profuse display of allurements could be seen there; and so deeply was he buried in the contemplation of these things that he lost sight of all external objects.\n\nAt the foot of the hill of Sourdun his attention was directed to the stage which they had reached in their journey. They had travelled only about five kilometres[6] at the most. He was annoyed at this tardy rate of travelling. He pulled down the coach-window in order to get a view of the road. He asked the conductor several times at what hour they would reach their destination. However, he eventually regained his composure, and remained seated in his corner of the vehicle with eyes wide open.\n\nThe lantern, which hung from the postilion's seat, threw its light on the buttocks of the shaft-horses. In front, only the manes of the other horses could be seen undulating like white billows. Their breathing caused a kind of fog to gather at each side of the team. The little iron chains of the harness rang; the windows shook in their sashes; and the heavy coach went rolling at an even pace over the pavement. Here and there could be distinguished the wall of a barn, or else an inn standing by itself. Sometimes, as they entered a village, a baker's oven threw out gleams of light; and the gigantic silhouettes of the horses kept rushing past the walls of the opposite houses. At every change of horses, when the harness was unfastened, there was a great silence for a minute. Overhead, under the awning, some passenger might be heard tapping with his feet, while a woman sitting at the threshold of the door screened her candle with her hand. Then the conductor would jump on the footboard, and the vehicle would start on its way again.\n\nAt Mormans, the striking of the clocks announced that it was a quarter past one.\n\n\"So then we are in another day,\" he thought, \"we have been in it for some time!\"\n\nBut gradually his hopes and his recollections, Nogent, the Rue de Choiseul, Madame Arnoux, and his mother, all got mixed up together.\n\nHe was awakened by the dull sound of wheels passing over planks: they were crossing the Pont de Charenton\u2014it was Paris. Then his two travelling companions, the first taking off his cap, and the second his silk handkerchief, put on their hats, and began to chat.\n\nThe first, a big, red-faced man in a velvet frock-coat, was a merchant; the second was coming up to the capital to consult a physician; and, fearing that he had disturbed this gentleman during the night, Frederick spontaneously apologised to him, so much had the young man's heart been softened by the feelings of happiness that possessed it. The wharf of the wet dock being flooded, no doubt, they went straight ahead; and once more they could see green fields. In the distance, tall factory-chimneys were sending forth their smoke. Then they turned into Ivry. Then drove up a street: all at once, he saw before him the dome of the Panth\u00e9on.\n\nThe plain, quite broken up, seemed a waste of ruins. The enclosing wall of the fortifications made a horizontal swelling there; and, on the footpath, on the ground at the side of the road, little branchless trees were protected by laths bristling with nails. Establishments for chemical products and timber-merchants' yards made their appearance alternately. High gates, like those seen in farm-houses, afforded glimpses, through their opening leaves, of wretched yards within, full of filth, with puddles of dirty water in the middle of them. Long wine-shops, of the colour of ox's blood, displayed in the first floor, between the windows, two billiard-cues crossing one another, with a wreath of painted flowers. Here and there might be noticed a half-built plaster hut, which had been allowed to remain unfinished. Then the double row of houses was no longer interrupted; and over their bare fronts enormous tin cigars showed themselves at some distance from each other, indicating tobacconists' shops. Midwives' signboards represented in each case a matron in a cap rocking a doll under a counterpane trimmed with lace. The corners of the walls were covered with placards, which, three-quarters torn, were quivering in the wind like rags. Workmen in blouses, brewers' drays, laundresses' and butchers' carts passed along. A thin rain was falling. It was cold. There was a pale sky; but two eyes, which to him were as precious as the sun, were shining behind the haze.\n\nThey had to wait a long time at the barrier, for vendors of poultry, wagoners, and a flock of sheep caused an obstruction there. The sentry, with his great-coat thrown back, walked to and fro in front of his box, to keep himself warm. The clerk who collected the city-dues clambered up to the roof of the diligence, and a cornet-\u00e0-piston sent forth a flourish. They went down the boulevard at a quick trot, the whipple-trees clapping and the traces hanging loose. The lash of the whip went cracking through the moist air. The conductor uttered his sonorous shout:\n\n\"Look alive! look alive! oho!\" and the scavengers drew out of the way, the pedestrians sprang back, the mud gushed against the coach-windows; they crossed dung-carts, cabs, and omnibuses. At length, the iron gate of the Jardin des Plantes came into sight.\n\nThe Seine, which was of a yellowish colour, almost reached the platforms of the bridges. A cool breath of air issued from it. Frederick inhaled it with his utmost energy, drinking in this good air of Paris, which seems to contain the effluvia of love and the emanations of the intellect. He was touched with emotion at the first glimpse of a hackney-coach. He gazed with delight on the thresholds of the wine-merchants' shops garnished with straw, on the shoe-blacks with their boxes, on the lads who sold groceries as they shook their coffee-burners. Women hurried along at a jog-trot with umbrellas over their heads. He bent forward to try whether he could distinguish their faces\u2014chance might have led Madame Arnoux to come out.\n\nThe shops displayed their wares. The crowd grew denser; the noise in the streets grew louder. After passing the Quai Saint-Bernard, the Quai de la Tournelle, and the Quai Montebello, they drove along the Quai Napol\u00e9on. He was anxious to see the windows there; but they were too far away from him. Then they once more crossed the Seine over the Pont-Neuf, and descended in the direction of the Louvre; and, having traversed the Rues Saint-Honor\u00e9, Croix des Petits-Champs, and Du Bouloi, he reached the Rue Coq-H\u00e9ron, and entered the courtyard of the hotel.\n\nTo make his enjoyment last the longer, Frederick dressed himself as slowly as possible, and even walked as far as the Boulevard Montmartre. He smiled at the thought of presently beholding once more the beloved name on the marble plate. He cast a glance upwards; there was no longer a trace of the display in the windows, the pictures, or anything else.\n\nHe hastened to the Rue de Choiseul. M. and Madame Arnoux no longer resided there, and a woman next door was keeping an eye on the porter's lodge. Frederick waited to see the porter himself. After some time he made his appearance\u2014it was no longer the same man. He did not know their address.\n\nFrederick went into a caf\u00e9, and, while at breakfast, consulted the Commercial Directory. There were three hundred Arnoux in it, but no Jacques Arnoux. Where, then, were they living? Pellerin ought to know.\n\nHe made his way to the very top of the Faubourg Poissonni\u00e8re, to the artist's studio. As the door had neither a bell nor a knocker, he rapped loudly on it with his knuckles, and then called out\u2014shouted. But the only response was the echo of his voice from the empty house.\n\nAfter this he thought of Hussonnet; but where could he discover a man of that sort? On one occasion he had waited on Hussonnet when the latter was paying a visit to his mistress's house in the Rue de Fleurus. Frederick had just reached the Rue de Fleurus when he became conscious of the fact that he did not even know the lady's name.\n\nHe had recourse to the Prefecture of Police. He wandered from staircase to staircase, from office to office. He found that the Intelligence Department was closed for the day, and was told to come back again next morning.\n\nThen he called at all the picture-dealers' shops that he could discover, and enquired whether they could give him any information as to Arnoux's whereabouts. The only answer he got was that M. Arnoux was no longer in the trade.\n\nAt last, discouraged, weary, sickened, he returned to his hotel, and went to bed. Just as he was stretching himself between the sheets, an idea flashed upon him which made him leap up with delight:\n\n\"Regimbart! what an idiot I was not to think of him before!\"\n\nNext morning, at seven o'clock, he arrived in the Rue N\u00f4tre Dame des Victoires, in front of a dram-shop, where Regimbart was in the habit of drinking white wine. It was not yet open. He walked about the neighbourhood, and at the end of about half-an-hour, presented himself at the place once more. Regimbart had left it.\n\nFrederick rushed out into the street. He fancied that he could even notice Regimbart's hat some distance away. A hearse and some mourning coaches intercepted his progress. When they had got out of the way, the vision had disappeared.\n\nFortunately, he recalled to mind that the Citizen breakfasted every day at eleven o'clock sharp, at a little restaurant in the Place Gaillon. All he had to do was to wait patiently till then; and, after sauntering about from the Bourse to the Madeleine, and from the Madeleine to the Gymnase, so long that it seemed as if it would never come to an end, Frederick, just as the clocks were striking eleven, entered the restaurant in the Rue Gaillon, certain of finding Regimbart there.\n\n\"Don't know!\" said the restaurant-keeper, in an unceremonious tone.\n\nFrederick persisted: the man replied:\n\n\"I have no longer any acquaintance with him, Monsieur\"\u2014and, as he spoke, he raised his eyebrows majestically and shook his head in a mysterious fashion.\n\nBut, in their last interview, the Citizen had referred to the Alexandre smoking-divan. Frederick swallowed a cake, jumped into a cab, and asked the driver whether there happened to be anywhere on the heights of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve a certain Caf\u00e9 Alexandre. The cabman drove him to the Rue des Francs Bourgeois Saint-Michel, where there was an establishment of that name, and in answer to his question:\n\n\"M. Regimbart, if you please?\" the keeper of the caf\u00e9 said with an unusually gracious smile:\n\n\"We have not seen him as yet, Monsieur,\" while he directed towards his wife, who sat behind the counter, a look of intelligence. And the next moment, turning towards the clock:\n\n\"But he'll be here, I hope, in ten minutes, or at most a quarter of an hour. Celestin, hurry with the newspapers! What would Monsieur like to take?\"\n\nThough he did not want to take anything, Frederick swallowed a glass of rum, then a glass of kirsch, then a glass of cura\u00e7oa, then several glasses of grog, both cold and hot. He read through that day's Si\u00e8cle, and then read it over again; he examined the caricatures in the Charivari down to the very tissue of the paper. When he had finished, he knew the advertisements by heart. From time to time, the tramp of boots on the footpath outside reached his ears\u2014it was he! and some one's form would trace its outlines on the window-panes; but it invariably passed on.\n\nIn order to get rid of the sense of weariness he experienced, Frederick shifted his seat. He took up his position at the lower end of the room; then at the right; after that at the left; and he remained in the middle of the bench with his arms stretched out. But a cat, daintily pressing down the velvet at the back of the seat, startled him by giving a sudden spring, in order to lick up the spots of syrup on the tray; and the child of the house, an insufferable brat of four, played noisily with a rattle on the bar steps. His mother, a pale-faced little woman, with decayed teeth, was smiling in a stupid sort of way. What in the world could Regimbart be doing? Frederick waited for him in an exceedingly miserable frame of mind.\n\nThe rain clattered like hail on the covering of the cab. Through the opening in the muslin curtain he could see the poor horse in the street more motionless than a horse made of wood. The stream of water, becoming enormous, trickled down between two spokes of the wheels, and the coachman was nodding drowsily with the horsecloth wrapped round him for protection, but fearing lest his fare might give him the slip, he opened the door every now and then, with the rain dripping from him as if falling from a mountain torrent; and, if things could get worn out by looking at them, the clock ought to have by this time been utterly dissolved, so frequently did Frederick rivet his eyes on it. However, it kept going. \"Mine host\" Alexandre walked up and down repeating, \"He'll come! Cheer up! he'll come!\" and, in order to divert his thoughts, talked politics, holding forth at some length. He even carried civility so far as to propose a game of dominoes.\n\nAt length when it was half-past four, Frederick, who had been there since about twelve, sprang to his feet, and declared that he would not wait any longer.\n\n\"I can't understand it at all myself,\" replied the caf\u00e9-keeper, in a tone of straightforwardness. \"This is the first time that M. Ledoux has failed to come!\"\n\n\"What! Monsieur Ledoux?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Monsieur!\"\n\n\"I said Regimbart,\" exclaimed Frederick, exasperated.\n\n\"Ah! a thousand pardons! You are making a mistake! Madame Alexandre, did not Monsieur say M. Ledoux?\"\n\nAnd, questioning the waiter: \"You heard him yourself, just as I did?\"\n\nNo doubt, to pay his master off for old scores, the waiter contented himself with smiling.\n\nFrederick drove back to the boulevards, indignant at having his time wasted, raging against the Citizen, but craving for his presence as if for that of a god, and firmly resolved to drag him forth, if necessary, from the depths of the most remote cellars. The vehicle in which he was driving only irritated him the more, and he accordingly got rid of it. His ideas were in a state of confusion. Then all the names of the caf\u00e9s which he had heard pronounced by that idiot burst forth at the same time from his memory like the thousand pieces of an exhibition of fireworks\u2014the Caf\u00e9 Gascard, the Caf\u00e9 Grimbert, the Caf\u00e9 Halbout, the Bordelais smoking-divan, the Havanais, the Havrais, the B\u0153uf \u00e0 la Mode, the Brasserie Allemande, and the M\u00e8re Morel; and he made his way to all of them in succession. But in one he was told that Regimbart had just gone out; in another, that he might perhaps call at a later hour; in a third, that they had not seen him for six months; and, in another place, that he had the day before ordered a leg of mutton for Saturday. Finally, at Vautier's dining-rooms, Frederick, on opening the door, knocked against the waiter.\n\n\"Do you know M. Regimbart?\"\n\n\"What, monsieur! do I know him? 'Tis I who have the honour of attending on him. He's upstairs\u2014he is just finishing his dinner!\"\n\nAnd, with a napkin under his arm, the master of the establishment himself accosted him:\n\n\"You're asking him for M. Regimbart, monsieur? He was here a moment ago.\"\n\nFrederick gave vent to an oath, but the proprietor of the dining-rooms stated that he would find the gentleman as a matter of certainty at Bouttevilain's.\n\n\"I assure you, on my honour, he left a little earlier than usual, for he had a business appointment with some gentlemen. But you'll find him, I tell you again, at Bouttevilain's, in the Rue Saint-Martin, No. 92, the second row of steps at the left, at the end of the courtyard\u2014first floor\u2014door to the right!\"\n\nAt last, he saw Regimbart, in a cloud of tobacco-smoke, by himself, at the lower end of the refreshment-room, near the billiard-table, with a glass of beer in front of him, and his chin lowered in a thoughtful attitude.\n\n\"Ah! I have been a long time searching for you!\"\n\nWithout rising, Regimbart extended towards him only two fingers, and, as if he had seen Frederick the day before, he gave utterance to a number of commonplace remarks about the opening of the session.\n\nFrederick interrupted him, saying in the most natural tone he could assume:\n\n\"Is Arnoux going on well?\"\n\nThe reply was a long time coming, as Regimbart was gargling the liquor in his throat:\n\n\"Yes, not badly.\"\n\n\"Where is he living now?\"\n\n\"Why, in the Rue Paradis Poissonni\u00e8re,\" the Citizen returned with astonishment.\n\n\"What number?\"\n\n\"Thirty-seven\u2014confound it! what a funny fellow you are!\"\n\nFrederick rose.\n\n\"What! are you going?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! I have to make a call\u2014some business matter I had forgotten! Good-bye!\"\n\nFrederick went from the smoking-divan to the Arnoux's residence, as if carried along by a tepid wind, with a sensation of extreme ease such as people experience in dreams.\n\nHe found himself soon on the second floor in front of a door, at the ringing of whose bell a servant appeared. A second door was flung open. Madame Arnoux was seated near the fire. Arnoux jumped up, and rushed across to embrace Frederick. She had on her lap a little boy not quite three years old. Her daughter, now as tall as herself, was standing up at the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Allow me to present this gentleman to you,\" said Arnoux, taking his son up in his arms. And he amused himself for some minutes in making the child jump up in the air very high, and then catching him with both hands as he came down.\n\n\"You'll kill him!\u2014ah! good heavens, have done!\" exclaimed Madame Arnoux.\n\nBut Arnoux, declaring that there was not the slightest danger, still kept tossing up the child, and even addressed him in words of endearment such as nurses use in the Marseillaise dialect, his natal tongue: \"Ah! my fine picheoun! my ducksy of a little nightingale!\"\n\nThen, he asked Frederick why he had been so long without writing to them, what he had been doing down in the country, and what brought him back.\n\n\"As for me, I am at present, my dear friend, a dealer in fa\u00efence. But let us talk about yourself!\"\n\nFrederick gave as reasons for his absence a protracted lawsuit and the state of his mother's health.\n\nHe laid special stress on the latter subject in order to make himself interesting. He ended by saying that this time he was going to settle in Paris for good; and he said nothing about the inheritance, lest it might be prejudicial to his past.\n\nThe curtains, like the upholstering of the furniture, were of maroon damask wool. Two pillows were close beside one another on the bolster. On the coal-fire a kettle was boiling; and the shade of the lamp, which stood near the edge of the chest of drawers, darkened the apartment. Madame Arnoux wore a large blue merino dressing-gown. With her face turned towards the fire and one hand on the shoulder of the little boy, she unfastened with the other the child's bodice. The youngster in his shirt began to cry, while scratching his head, like the son of M. Alexandre.\n\nFrederick expected that he would have felt spasms of joy; but the passions grow pale when we find ourselves in an altered situation; and, as he no longer saw Madame Arnoux in the environment wherein he had known her, she seemed to him to have lost some of her fascination; to have degenerated in some way that he could not comprehend\u2014in fact, not to be the same. He was astonished at the serenity of his own heart. He made enquiries about some old friends, about Pellerin, amongst others.\n\n\"I don't see him often,\" said Arnoux. She added:\n\n\"We no longer entertain as we used to do formerly!\"\n\nWas the object of this to let him know that he would get no invitation from them? But Arnoux, continuing to exhibit the same cordiality, reproached him for not having come to dine with them uninvited; and he explained why he had changed his business.\n\n\"What are you to do in an age of decadence like ours? Great painting is gone out of fashion! Besides, we may import art into everything. You know that, for my part, I am a lover of the beautiful. I must bring you one of these days to see my earthenware works.\"\n\nAnd he wanted to show Frederick immediately some of his productions in the store which he had between the ground-floor and the first floor.\n\nDishes, soup-tureens, and washhand-basins encumbered the floor. Against the walls were laid out large squares of pavement for bathrooms and dressing-rooms, with mythological subjects in the Renaissance style; whilst in the centre, a pair of whatnots, rising up to the ceiling, supported ice-urns, flower-pots, candelabra, little flower-stands, and large statuettes of many colours, representing a negro or a shepherdess in the Pompadour fashion. Frederick, who was cold and hungry, was bored with Arnoux's display of his wares. He hurried off to the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, where he ordered a sumptuous supper, and while eating, said to himself:\n\n\"I was well off enough below there with all my troubles! She scarcely took any notice of me! How like a shopkeeper's wife!\"\n\nAnd in an abrupt expansion of healthfulness, he formed egoistic resolutions. He felt his heart as hard as the table on which his elbows rested. So then he could by this time plunge fearlessly into the vortex of society. The thought of the Dambreuses recurred to his mind. He would make use of them. Then he recalled Deslauriers to mind. \"Ah! faith, so much the worse!\" Nevertheless, he sent him a note by a messenger, making an appointment with him for the following day, in order that they might breakfast together.\n\nFortune had not been so kind to the other.\n\nHe had presented himself at the examination for a fellowship with a thesis on the law of wills, in which he maintained that the powers of testators ought to be restricted as much as possible; and, as his adversary provoked him in such a way as to make him say foolish things, he gave utterance to many of these absurdities without in any way inducing the examiners to falter in deciding that he was wrong. Then chance so willed it that he should choose by lot, as a subject for a lecture, Prescription. Thereupon, Deslauriers gave vent to some lamentable theories: the questions in dispute in former times ought to be brought forward as well as those which had recently arisen; why should the proprietor be deprived of his estate because he could furnish his title-deeds only after the lapse of thirty-one years? This was giving the security of the honest man to the inheritor of the enriched thief. Every injustice was consecrated by extending this law, which was a form of tyranny, the abuse of force! He had even exclaimed: \"Abolish it; and the Franks will no longer oppress the Gauls, the English oppress the Irish, the Yankee oppress the Redskins, the Turks oppress the Arabs, the whites oppress the blacks, Poland\u2014\u2014\"\n\nThe President interrupted him: \"Well! well! Monsieur, we have nothing to do with your political opinions\u2014you will have them represented in your behalf by-and-by!\"\n\nDeslauriers did not wish to have his opinions represented; but this unfortunate Title XX. of the Third Book of the Civil Code had become a sort of mountain over which he stumbled. He was elaborating a great work on \"Prescription considered as the Basis of the Civil Law and of the Law of Nature amongst Peoples\"; and he got lost in Dunod, Rogerius, Balbus, Merlin, Vazeille, Savigny, Traplong, and other weighty authorities on the subject. In order to have more leisure for the purpose of devoting himself to this task, he had resigned his post of head-clerk. He lived by giving private tuitions and preparing theses; and at the meetings of newly-fledged barristers to rehearse legal arguments he frightened by his display of virulence those who held conservative views, all the young doctrinaires who acknowledged M. Guizot as their master\u2014so that in a certain set he had gained a sort of celebrity, mingled, in a slight degree, with lack of confidence in him as an individual.\n\nHe came to keep the appointment in a big paletot, lined with red flannel, like the one S\u00e9n\u00e9cal used to wear in former days.\n\nHuman respect on account of the passers-by prevented them from straining one another long in an embrace of friendship; and they made their way to V\u00e9four's arm-in-arm, laughing pleasantly, though with tear-drops lingering in the depths of their eyes. Then, as soon as they were free from observation, Deslauriers exclaimed:\n\n\"Ah! damn it! we'll have a jolly time of it now!\"\n\nFrederick was not quite pleased to find Deslauriers all at once associating himself in this way with his own newly-acquired inheritance. His friend exhibited too much pleasure on account of them both, and not enough on his account alone.\n\nAfter this, Deslauriers gave details about the reverse he had met with, and gradually told Frederick all about his occupations and his daily existence, speaking of himself in a stoical fashion, and of others in tones of intense bitterness. He found fault with everything; there was not a man in office who was not an idiot or a rascal. He flew into a passion against the waiter for having a glass badly rinsed, and, when Frederick uttered a reproach with a view to mitigating his wrath: \"As if I were going to annoy myself with such numbskulls, who, you must know, can earn as much as six and even eight thousand francs a year, who are electors, perhaps eligible as candidates. Ah! no, no!\"\n\nThen, with a sprightly air, \"But I've forgotten that I'm talking to a capitalist, to a Mondor,[7] for you are a Mondor now!\"\n\nAnd, coming back to the question of the inheritance, he gave expression to this view\u2014that collateral successorship (a thing unjust in itself, though in the present case he was glad it was possible) would be abolished one of these days at the approaching revolution.\n\n\"Do you believe in that?\" said Frederick.\n\n\"Be sure of it!\" he replied. \"This sort of thing cannot last. There is too much suffering. When I see into the wretchedness of men like S\u00e9n\u00e9cal\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Always S\u00e9n\u00e9cal!\" thought Frederick.\n\n\"But, at all events, tell me the news? Are you still in love with Madame Arnoux? Is it all over\u2014eh?\"\n\nFrederick, not knowing what answer to give him, closed his eyes and hung down his head.\n\nWith regard to Arnoux, Deslauriers told him that the journal was now the property of Hussonnet, who had transformed it. It was called \"L'Art, a literary institution\u2014a company with shares of one hundred francs each; capital of the firm, forty thousand francs,\" each shareholder having the right to put into it his own contributions; for \"the company has for its object to publish the works of beginners, to spare talent, perchance genius, the sad crises which drench,\" etc.\n\n\"You see the dodge!\" There was, however, something to be effected by the change\u2014the tone of the journal could be raised; then, without any delay, while retaining the same writers, and promising a continuation of the feuilleton, to supply the subscribers with a political organ: the amount to be advanced would not be very great.\n\n\"What do you think of it? Come! would you like to have a hand in it?\"\n\nFrederick did not reject the proposal; but he pointed out that it was necessary for him to attend to the regulation of his affairs.\n\n\"After that, if you require anything\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Thanks, my boy!\" said Deslauriers.\n\nThen, they smoked puros, leaning with their elbows on the shelf covered with velvet beside the window. The sun was shining; the air was balmy. Flocks of birds, fluttering about, swooped down into the garden. The statues of bronze and marble, washed by the rain, were glistening. Nursery-maids wearing aprons, were seated on chairs, chatting together; and the laughter of children could be heard mingling with the continuous plash that came from the sheaf-jets of the fountain.\n\nFrederick was troubled by Deslauriers' irritability; but under the influence of the wine which circulated through his veins, half-asleep, in a state of torpor, with the sun shining full on his face, he was no longer conscious of anything save a profound sense of comfort, a kind of voluptuous feeling that stupefied him, as a plant is saturated with heat and moisture. Deslauriers, with half-closed eyelids, was staring vacantly into the distance. His breast swelled, and he broke out in the following strain:\n\n\"Ah! those were better days when Camille Desmoulins, standing below there on a table, drove the people on to the Bastille. Men really lived in those times; they could assert themselves, and prove their strength! Simple advocates commanded generals. Kings were beaten by beggars; whilst now\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe stopped, then added all of a sudden:\n\n\"Pooh! the future is big with great things!\"\n\nAnd, drumming a battle-march on the window-panes, he declaimed some verses of Barth\u00e9lemy, which ran thus:\n\n\"'That dread Assembly shall again appear,\nWhich, after forty years, fills you with fear,\nMarching with giant stride and dauntless soul'[8]\n\u2014I don't know the rest of it! But 'tis late; suppose we go?\"\n\nAnd he went on setting forth his theories in the street.\n\nFrederick, without listening to him, was looking at certain materials and articles of furniture in the shop-windows which would be suitable for his new residence in Paris; and it was, perhaps, the thought of Madame Arnoux that made him stop before a second-hand dealer's window, where three plates made of fine ware were exposed to view. They were decorated with yellow arabesques with metallic reflections, and were worth a hundred crowns apiece. He got them put by.\n\n\"For my part, if I were in your place,\" said Deslauriers, \"I would rather buy silver plate,\" revealing by this love of substantial things the man of mean extraction.\n\nAs soon as he was alone, Frederick repaired to the establishment of the celebrated Pomad\u00e8re, where he ordered three pairs of trousers, two coats, a pelisse trimmed with fur, and five waistcoats. Then he called at a bootmaker's, a shirtmaker's, and a hatter's, giving them directions in each shop to make the greatest possible haste. Three days later, on the evening of his return from Havre, he found his complete wardrobe awaiting him in his Parisian abode; and impatient to make use of it, he resolved to pay an immediate visit to the Dambreuses. But it was too early yet\u2014scarcely eight o'clock.\n\n\"Suppose I went to see the others?\" said he to himself.\n\nHe came upon Arnoux, all alone, in the act of shaving in front of his glass. The latter proposed to drive him to a place where they could amuse themselves, and when M. Dambreuse was referred to, \"Ah, that's just lucky! You'll see some of his friends there. Come on, then! It will be good fun!\"\n\nFrederick asked to be excused. Madame Arnoux recognised his voice, and wished him good-day, through the partition, for her daughter was indisposed, and she was also rather unwell herself. The noise of a soup-ladle against a glass could be heard from within, and all those quivering sounds made by things being lightly moved about, which are usual in a sick-room. Then Arnoux left his dressing-room to say good-bye to his wife. He brought forward a heap of reasons for going out:\n\n\"You know well that it is a serious matter! I must go there; 'tis a case of necessity. They'll be waiting for me!\"\n\n\"Go, go, my dear! Amuse yourself!\"\n\nArnoux hailed a hackney-coach:\n\n\"Palais Royal, No. 7 Montpensier Gallery.\" And, as he let himself sink back in the cushions:\n\n\"Ah! how tired I am, my dear fellow! It will be the death of me! However, I can tell it to you\u2014to you!\"\n\nHe bent towards Frederick's ear in a mysterious fashion:\n\n\"I am trying to discover again the red of Chinese copper!\"\n\nAnd he explained the nature of the glaze and the little fire.\n\nOn their arrival at Chevet's shop, a large hamper was brought to him, which he stowed away in the hackney-coach. Then he bought for his \"poor wife\" pine-apples and various dainties, and directed that they should be sent early next morning.\n\nAfter this, they called at a costumer's establishment; it was to a ball they were going.\n\nArnoux selected blue velvet breeches, a vest of the same material, and a red wig; Frederick a domino; and they went down the Rue de Laval towards a house the second floor of which was illuminated by coloured lanterns.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs they heard violins playing above.\n\n\"Where the deuce are you bringing me to?\" said Frederick.\n\n\"To see a nice girl! don't be afraid!\"\n\nThe door was opened for them by a groom; and they entered the anteroom, where paletots, mantles, and shawls were thrown together in a heap on some chairs. A young woman in the costume of a dragoon of Louis XIV.'s reign was passing at that moment. It was Mademoiselle Rosanette Bron, the mistress of the place.\n\n\"Well?\" said Arnoux.\n\n\"'Tis done!\" she replied.\n\n\"Ah! thanks, my angel!\"\n\nAnd he wanted to kiss her.\n\n\"Take care, now, you foolish man! You'll spoil the paint on my face!\"\n\nArnoux introduced Frederick.\n\n\"Step in there, Monsieur; you are quite welcome!\"\n\nShe drew aside a door-curtain, and cried out with a certain emphasis:\n\n\"Here's my lord Arnoux, girl, and a princely friend of his!\"\n\nFrederick was at first dazzled by the lights. He could see nothing save some silk and velvet dresses, naked shoulders, a mass of colours swaying to and fro to the accompaniment of an orchestra hidden behind green foliage, between walls hung with yellow silk, with pastel portraits here and there and crystal chandeliers in the style of Louis XVI.'s period. High lamps, whose globes of roughened glass resembled snowballs, looked down on baskets of flowers placed on brackets in the corners; and at the opposite side, at the rear of a second room, smaller in size, one could distinguish, in a third, a bed with twisted posts, and at its head a Venetian mirror.\n\nThe dancing stopped, and there were bursts of applause, a hubbub of delight, as Arnoux was seen advancing with his hamper on his head; the eatables contained in it made a lump in the centre.\n\n\"Make way for the lustre!\"\n\nFrederick raised his eyes: it was the lustre of old Saxe that had adorned the shop attached to the office of L'Art Industriel. The memory of former days was brought back to his mind. But a foot-soldier of the line in undress, with that silly expression of countenance ascribed by tradition to conscripts, planted himself right in front of him, spreading out his two arms in order to emphasise his astonishment, and, in spite of the hideous black moustaches, unusually pointed, which disfigured his face, Frederick recognised his old friend Hussonnet. In a half-Alsatian, half-negro kind of gibberish, the Bohemian loaded him with congratulations, calling him his colonel. Frederick, put out of countenance by the crowd of personages assembled around him, was at a loss for an answer. At a tap on the desk from a fiddlestick, the partners in the dance fell into their places.\n\nThey were about sixty in number, the women being for the most part dressed either as village-girls or marchionesses, and the men, who were nearly all of mature age, being got up as wagoners, 'longshoremen, or sailors.\n\nFrederick having taken up his position close to the wall, stared at those who were going through the quadrille in front of him.\n\nAn old beau, dressed like a Venetian Doge in a long gown or purple silk, was dancing with Mademoiselle Rosanette, who wore a green coat, laced breeches, and boots of soft leather with gold spurs. The pair in front of them consisted of an Albanian laden with yataghans and a Swiss girl with blue eyes and skin white as milk, who looked as plump as a quail with her chemise-sleeves and red corset exposed to view. In order to turn to account her hair, which fell down to her hips, a tall blonde, a walking lady in the opera, had assumed the part of a female savage; and over her brown swaddling-cloth she displayed nothing save leathern breeches, glass bracelets, and a tinsel diadem, from which rose a large sheaf of peacock's feathers. In front of her, a gentleman who had intended to represent Pritchard,[9] muffled up in a grotesquely big black coat, was beating time with his elbows on his snuff-box. A little Watteau shepherd in blue-and-silver, like moonlight, dashed his crook against the thyrsus of a Bacchante crowned with grapes, who wore a leopard's skin over her left side, and buskins with gold ribbons. On the other side, a Polish lady, in a spencer of nacarat-coloured velvet, made her gauze petticoat flutter over her pearl-gray stockings, which rose above her fashionable pink boots bordered with white fur. She was smiling on a big-paunched man of forty, disguised as a choir-boy, who was skipping very high, lifting up his surplice with one hand, and with the other his red clerical cap. But the queen, the star, was Mademoiselle Loulou, a celebrated dancer at public halls. As she had now become wealthy, she wore a large lace collar over her vest of smooth black velvet; and her wide trousers of poppy-coloured silk, clinging closely to her figure, and drawn tight round her waist by a cashmere scarf, had all over their seams little natural white camellias. Her pale face, a little puffed, and with the nose somewhat retrouss\u00e9, looked all the more pert from the disordered appearance of her wig, over which she had with a touch of her hand clapped a man's grey felt hat, so that it covered her right ear; and, with every bounce she made, her pumps, adorned with diamond buckles, nearly reached the nose of her neighbour, a big medi\u00e6val baron, who was quite entangled in his steel armour. There was also an angel, with a gold sword in her hand, and two swan's wings over her back, who kept rushing up and down, every minute losing her partner who appeared as Louis XIV., displaying an utter ignorance of the figures and confusing the quadrille.\n\nFrederick, as he gazed at these people, experienced a sense of forlornness, a feeling of uneasiness. He was still thinking of Madame Arnoux and it seemed to him as if he were taking part in some plot that was being hatched against her.\n\nWhen the quadrille was over, Mademoiselle Rosanette accosted him. She was slightly out of breath, and her gorget, polished like a mirror, swelled up softly under her chin.\n\n\"And you, Monsieur,\" said she, \"don't you dance?\"\n\nFrederick excused himself; he did not know how to dance.\n\n\"Really! but with me? Are you quite sure?\" And, poising herself on one hip, with her other knee a little drawn back, while she stroked with her left hand the mother-of-pearl pommel of her sword, she kept staring at him for a minute with a half-beseeching, half-teasing air. At last she said \"Good night! then,\" made a pirouette, and disappeared.\n\nFrederick, dissatisfied with himself, and not well knowing what to do, began to wander through the ball-room.\n\nHe entered the boudoir padded with pale blue silk, with bouquets of flowers from the fields, whilst on the ceiling, in a circle of gilt wood, Cupids, emerging out of an azure sky, played over the clouds, resembling down in appearance. This display of luxuries, which would to-day be only trifles to persons like Rosanette, dazzled him, and he admired everything\u2014the artificial convolvuli which adorned the surface of the mirror, the curtains on the mantelpiece, the Turkish divan, and a sort of tent in a recess in the wall, with pink silk hangings and a covering of white muslin overhead. Furniture made of dark wood with inlaid work of copper filled the sleeping apartment, where, on a platform covered with swan's-down, stood the large canopied bedstead trimmed with ostrich-feathers. Pins, with heads made of precious stones, stuck into pincushions, rings trailing over trays, lockets with hoops of gold, and little silver chests, could be distinguished in the shade under the light shed by a Bohemian urn suspended from three chainlets. Through a little door, which was slightly ajar, could be seen a hot-house occupying the entire breadth of a terrace, with an aviary at the other end.\n\nHere were surroundings specially calculated to charm him. In a sudden revolt of his youthful blood he swore that he would enjoy such things; he grew bold; then, coming back to the place opening into the drawing-room, where there was now a larger gathering\u2014it kept moving about in a kind of luminous pulverulence\u2014he stood to watch the quadrilles, blinking his eyes to see better, and inhaling the soft perfumes of the women, which floated through the atmosphere like an immense kiss.\n\nBut, close to him, on the other side of the door, was Pellerin\u2014Pellerin, in full dress, his left arm over his breast and with his hat and a torn white glove in his right.\n\n\"Halloa! 'Tis a long time since we saw you! Where the deuce have you been? Gone to travel in Italy? 'Tis a commonplace country enough\u2014Italy, eh? not so unique as people say it is? No matter! Will you bring me your sketches one of these days?\"\n\nAnd, without giving him time to answer, the artist began talking about himself. He had made considerable progress, having definitely satisfied himself as to the stupidity of the line. We ought not to look so much for beauty and unity in a work as for character and diversity of subject.\n\n\"For everything exists in nature; therefore, everything is legitimate; everything is plastic. It is only a question of catching the note, mind you! I have discovered the secret.\" And giving him a nudge, he repeated several times, \"I have discovered the secret, you see! just look at that little woman with the head-dress of a sphinx who is dancing with a Russian postilion\u2014that's neat, dry, fixed, all in flats and in stiff tones\u2014indigo under the eyes, a patch of vermilion on the cheek, and bistre on the temples\u2014pif! paf!\" And with his thumb he drew, as it were, pencil-strokes in the air. \"Whilst the big one over there,\" he went on, pointing towards a fishwife in a cherry gown with a gold cross hanging from her neck, and a lawn fichu fastened round her shoulders, \"is nothing but curves. The nostrils are spread out just like the borders of her cap; the corners of the mouth are rising up; the chin sinks: all is fleshy, melting, abundant, tranquil, and sunshiny\u2014a true Rubens! Nevertheless, they are both perfect! Where, then, is the type?\" He grew warm with the subject. \"What is this but a beautiful woman? What is it but the beautiful? Ah! the beautiful\u2014tell me what that is\u2014\u2014\"\n\nFrederick interrupted him to enquire who was the merry-andrew with the face of a he-goat, who was in the very act of blessing all the dancers in the middle of a pastourelle.\n\n\"Oh! he's not much!\u2014a widower, the father of three boys. He leaves them without breeches, spends his whole day at the club, and lives with the servant!\"\n\n\"And who is that dressed like a bailiff talking in the recess of the window to a Marquise de Pompadour?\"\n\n\"The Marquise is Mademoiselle Vandael, formerly an actress at the Gymnase, the mistress of the Doge, the Comte de Palazot. They have now been twenty years living together\u2014nobody can tell why. Had she fine eyes at one time, this woman? As for the citizen by her side, his name is Captain d'Herbigny, an old man of the hurdy-gurdy sort that you can play on, with nothing in the world except his Cross of the Legion of Honour and his pension. He passes for the uncle of the grisettes at festival times, arranges duels, and dines in the city.\"\n\n\"A rascal?\" said Frederick.\n\n\"No! an honest man!\"\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\nThe artist was going on to mention the names of many others, when, perceiving a gentleman who, like Moli\u00e8re's physician, wore a big black serge gown opening very wide as it descended in order to display all his trinkets:\n\n\"The person who presents himself there before you is Dr. Des Rogis, who, full of rage at not having made a name for himself, has written a book of medical pornography, and willingly blacks people's boots in society, while he is at the same time discreet. These ladies adore him. He and his wife (that lean ch\u00e2telaine in the grey dress) trip about together at every public place\u2014aye, and at other places too. In spite of domestic embarrassments, they have a day\u2014artistic teas, at which verses are recited. Attention!\"\n\nIn fact, the doctor came up to them at that moment; and soon they formed all three, at the entrance to the drawing-room, a group of talkers, which was presently augmented by Hussonnet, then by the lover of the female savage, a young poet who displayed, under a court cloak of Francis I.'s reign, the most pitiful of anatomies, and finally a sprightly youth disguised as a Turk of the barrier. But his vest with its yellow galloon had taken so many voyages on the backs of strolling dentists, his wide trousers full of creases, were of so faded a red, his turban, rolled about like an eel in the Tartar fashion, was so poor in appearance\u2014in short, his entire costume was so wretched and made-up, that the women did not attempt to hide their disgust. The doctor consoled him by pronouncing eulogies on his mistress, the lady in the dress of a 'longshorewoman. This Turk was a banker's son.\n\nBetween two quadrilles, Rosanette advanced towards the mantelpiece, where an obese little old man, in a maroon coat with gold buttons, had seated himself in an armchair. In spite of his withered cheeks, which fell over his white cravat, his hair, still fair, and curling naturally like that of a poodle, gave him a certain frivolity of aspect.\n\nShe was listening to him with her face bent close to his. Presently, she accommodated him with a little glass of syrup; and nothing could be more dainty than her hands under their laced sleeves, which passed over the facings of her green coat. When the old man had swallowed it, he kissed them.\n\n\"Why, that's M. Oudry, a neighbor of Arnoux!\"\n\n\"He has lost her!\" said Pellerin, smiling.\n\nA Longjumeau postilion caught her by the waist. A waltz was beginning. Then all the women, seated round the drawing-room on benches, rose up quickly at the same time; and their petticoats, their scarfs, and their head-dresses went whirling round.\n\nThey whirled so close to him that Frederick could notice the beads of perspiration on their foreheads; and this gyral movement, more and more lively, regular, provocative of dizzy sensations, communicated to his mind a sort of intoxication, which made other images surge up within it, while every woman passed with the same dazzling effect, and each of them with a special kind of exciting influence, according to her style of beauty.\n\nThe Polish lady, surrendering herself in a languorous fashion, inspired him with a longing to clasp her to his heart while they were both spinning forward on a sledge along a plain covered with snow. Horizons of tranquil voluptuousness in a ch\u00e2let at the side of a lake opened out under the footsteps of the Swiss girl, who waltzed with her bust erect and her eyelashes drooping. Then, suddenly, the Bacchante, bending back her head with its dark locks, made him dream of devouring caresses in a wood of oleanders, in the midst of a storm, to the confused accompaniment of tabours. The fishwife, who was panting from the rapidity of the music, which was far too great for her, gave vent to bursts of laughter; and he would have liked, while drinking with her in some tavern in the \"Porcherons,\"[10] to rumple her fichu with both hands, as in the good old times. But the 'longshorewoman, whose light toes barely skimmed the floor, seemed to conceal under the suppleness of her limbs and the seriousness of her face all the refinements of modern love, which possesses the exactitude of a science and the mobility of a bird. Rosanette was whirling with arms akimbo; her wig, in an awkward position, bobbing over her collar, flung iris-powder around her; and, at every turn, she was near catching hold of Frederick with the ends of her gold spurs.\n\nDuring the closing bar of the waltz, Mademoiselle Vatnaz made her appearance. She had an Algerian handkerchief on her head, a number of piastres on her forehead, antimony at the edges of her eyes, with a kind of paletot made of black cashmere falling over a petticoat of sparkling colour, with stripes of silver; and in her hand she held a tambourine.\n\nBehind her back came a tall fellow in the classical costume of Dante, who happened to be\u2014she now made no concealment any longer about it\u2014the ex-singer of the Alhambra, and who, though his name was Auguste Delamare, had first called himself Ant\u00e9nor Delamarre, then Delmas, then Belmar, and at last Delmar, thus modifying and perfecting his name, as his celebrity increased, for he had forsaken the public-house concert for the theatre, and had even just made his d\u00e9but in a noisy fashion at the Ambigu in Gaspardo le P\u00e9cheur.\n\nHussonnet, on seeing him, knitted his brows. Since his play had been rejected, he hated actors. It was impossible to conceive the vanity of individuals of this sort, and above all of this fellow. \"What a prig! Just look at him!\"\n\nAfter a light bow towards Rosanette, Delmar leaned back against the mantelpiece; and he remained motionless with one hand over his heart, his left foot thrust forward, his eyes raised towards heaven, with his wreath of gilt laurels above his cowl, while he strove to put into the expression of his face a considerable amount of poetry in order to fascinate the ladies. They made, at some distance, a great circle around him.\n\nBut the Vatnaz, having given Rosanette a prolonged embrace, came to beg of Hussonnet to revise, with a view to the improvement of the style, an educational work which she intended to publish, under the title of \"The Young Ladies' Garland,\" a collection of literature and moral philosophy.\n\nThe man of letters promised to assist her in the preparation of the work. Then she asked him whether he could not in one of the prints to which he had access give her friend a slight puff, and even assign to him, later, some part. Hussonnet had forgotten to take a glass of punch on account of her.\n\nIt was Arnoux who had brewed the beverage; and, followed by the Comte's groom carrying an empty tray, he offered it to the ladies with a self-satisfied air.\n\nWhen he came to pass in front of M. Oudry, Rosanette stopped him.\n\n\"Well\u2014and this little business?\"\n\nHe coloured slightly; finally, addressing the old man:\n\n\"Our fair friend tells me that you would have the kindness\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"What of that, neighbour? I am quite at your service!\"\n\nAnd M. Dambreuse's name was pronounced. As they were talking to one another in low tones, Frederick could only hear indistinctly; and he made his way to the other side of the mantelpiece, where Rosanette and Delmar were chatting together.\n\nThe mummer had a vulgar countenance, made, like the scenery of the stage, to be viewed from a distance\u2014coarse hands, big feet, and a heavy jaw; and he disparaged the most distinguished actors, spoke of poets with patronising contempt, made use of the expressions \"my organ,\" \"my physique,\" \"my powers,\" enamelling his conversation with words that were scarcely intelligible even to himself, and for which he had quite an affection, such as \"morbidezza,\" \"analogue,\" and \"homogeneity.\"\n\nRosanette listened to him with little nods of approbation. One could see her enthusiasm bursting out under the paint on her cheeks, and a touch of moisture passed like a veil over her bright eyes of an indefinable colour. How could such a man as this fascinate her? Frederick internally excited himself to greater contempt for him, in order to banish, perhaps, the species of envy which he felt with regard to him.\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz was now with Arnoux, and, while laughing from time to time very loudly, she cast glances towards Rosanette, of whom M. Oudry did not lose sight.\n\nThen Arnoux and the Vatnaz disappeared. The old man began talking in a subdued voice to Rosanette.\n\n\"Well, yes, 'tis settled then! Leave me alone!\"\n\nAnd she asked Frederick to go and give a look into the kitchen to see whether Arnoux happened to be there.\n\nA battalion of glasses half-full covered the floor; and the saucepans, the pots, the turbot-kettle, and the frying-stove were all in a state of commotion. Arnoux was giving directions to the servants, whom he \"thee'd\" and \"thou'd,\" beating up the mustard, tasting the sauces, and larking with the housemaid.\n\n\"All right,\" he said; \"tell them 'tis ready! I'm going to have it served up.\"\n\nThe dancing had ceased. The women came and sat down; the men were walking about. In the centre of the drawing-room, one of the curtains stretched over a window was swelling in the wind; and the Sphinx, in spite of the observations of everyone, exposed her sweating arms to the current of air.\n\nWhere could Rosanette be? Frederick went on further to find her, even into her boudoir and her bedroom. Some, in order to be alone, or to be in pairs, had retreated into the corners. Whisperings intermingled with the shade. There were little laughs stifled under handkerchiefs, and at the sides of women's corsages one could catch glimpses of fans quivering with slow, gentle movements, like the beating of a wounded bird's wings.\n\nAs he entered the hot-house, he saw under the large leaves of a caladium near the jet d'eau, Delmar lying on his face on the sofa covered with linen cloth. Rosanette, seated beside him, had passed her fingers through his hair; and they were gazing into each other's faces. At the same moment, Arnoux came in at the opposite side\u2014that which was near the aviary. Delmar sprang to his feet; then he went out at a rapid pace, without turning round; and even paused close to the door to gather a hibiscus flower, with which he adorned his button-hole. Rosanette hung down her head; Frederick, who caught a sight of her profile, saw that she was in tears.\n\n\"I say! What's the matter with you?\" exclaimed Arnoux.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders without replying.\n\n\"Is it on account of him?\" he went on.\n\nShe threw her arms round his neck, and kissing him on the forehead, slowly:\n\n\"You know well that I will always love you, my big fellow! Think no more about it! Let us go to supper!\"\n\nA copper chandelier with forty wax tapers lighted up the dining-room, the walls of which were hidden from view under some fine old earthenware that was hung up there; and this crude light, falling perpendicularly, rendered still whiter, amid the side-dishes and the fruits, a huge turbot which occupied the centre of the tablecloth, with plates all round filled with crayfish soup. With a rustle of garments, the women, having arranged their skirts, their sleeves, and their scarfs, took their seats beside one another; the men, standing up, posted themselves at the corners. Pellerin and M. Oudry were placed near Rosanette. Arnoux was facing her. Palazot and his female companion had just gone out.\n\n\"Good-bye to them!\" said she. \"Now let us begin the attack!\"\n\nAnd the choir-boy, a facetious man with a big sign of the cross, said grace.\n\nThe ladies were scandalised, and especially the fishwife, the mother of a young girl of whom she wished to make an honest woman. Neither did Arnoux like \"that sort of thing,\" as he considered that religion ought to be respected.\n\nA German clock with a cock attached to it happening to chime out the hour of two, gave rise to a number of jokes about the cuckoo. All kinds of talk followed\u2014puns, anecdotes, bragging remarks, bets, lies taken for truth, improbable assertions, a tumult of words, which soon became dispersed in the form of chats between particular individuals. The wines went round; the dishes succeeded each other; the doctor carved. An orange or a cork would every now and then be flung from a distance. People would quit their seats to go and talk to some one at another end of the table. Rosanette turned round towards Delmar, who sat motionless behind her; Pellerin kept babbling; M. Oudry smiled. Mademoiselle Vatnaz ate, almost alone, a group of crayfish, and the shells crackled under her long teeth. The angel, poised on the piano-stool\u2014the only place on which her wings permitted her to sit down\u2014was placidly masticating without ever stopping.\n\n\"What an appetite!\" the choir-boy kept repeating in amazement, \"what an appetite!\"\n\nAnd the Sphinx drank brandy, screamed out with her throat full, and wriggled like a demon. Suddenly her jaws swelled, and no longer being able to keep down the blood which rushed to her head and nearly choked her, she pressed her napkin against her lips, and threw herself under the table.\n\nFrederick had seen her falling: \"'Tis nothing!\" And at his entreaties to be allowed to go and look after her, she replied slowly:\n\n\"Pooh! what's the good? That's just as pleasant as anything else. Life is not so amusing!\"\n\nThen, he shivered, a feeling of icy sadness taking possession of him, as if he had caught a glimpse of whole worlds of wretchedness and despair\u2014a chafing-dish of charcoal beside a folding-bed, the corpses of the Morgue in leathern aprons, with the tap of cold water that flows over their heads.\n\nMeanwhile, Hussonnet, squatted at the feet of the female savage, was howling in a hoarse voice in imitation of the actor Grassot:\n\n\"Be not cruel, O Celuta! this little family f\u00eate is charming! Intoxicate me with delight, my loves! Let us be gay! let us be gay!\"\n\nAnd he began kissing the women on the shoulders. They quivered under the tickling of his moustaches. Then he conceived the idea of breaking a plate against his head by rapping it there with a little energy. Others followed his example. The broken earthenware flew about in bits like slates in a storm; and the 'longshorewoman exclaimed:\n\n\"Don't bother yourselves about it; these cost nothing. We get a present of them from the merchant who makes them!\"\n\nEvery eye was riveted on Arnoux. He replied:\n\n\"Ha! about the invoice\u2014allow me!\" desiring, no doubt, to pass for not being, or for no longer being, Rosanette's lover.\n\nBut two angry voices here made themselves heard:\n\n\"Idiot!\"\n\n\"Rascal!\"\n\n\"I am at your command!\"\n\n\"So am I at yours!\"\n\nIt was the medi\u00e6val knight and the Russian postilion who were disputing, the latter having maintained that armour dispensed with bravery, while the other regarded this view as an insult. He desired to fight; all interposed to prevent him, and in the midst of the uproar the captain tried to make himself heard.\n\n\"Listen to me, messieurs! One word! I have some experience, messieurs!\"\n\nRosanette, by tapping with her knife on a glass, succeeded eventually in restoring silence, and, addressing the knight, who had kept his helmet on, and then the postilion, whose head was covered with a hairy cap:\n\n\"Take off that saucepan of yours! and you, there, your wolf's head! Are you going to obey me, damn you? Pray show respect to my epaulets! I am your commanding officer!\"\n\nThey complied, and everyone present applauded, exclaiming, \"Long live the Mar\u00e9chale! long live the Mar\u00e9chale!\" Then she took a bottle of champagne off the stove, and poured out its contents into the cups which they successively stretched forth to her. As the table was very large, the guests, especially the women, came over to her side, and stood erect on tiptoe on the slats of the chairs, so as to form, for the space of a minute, a pyramidal group of head-dresses, naked shoulders, extended arms, and stooping bodies; and over all these objects a spray of wine played for some time, for the merry-andrew and Arnoux, at opposite corners of the dining-room, each letting fly the cork of a bottle, splashed the faces of those around them.\n\nThe little birds of the aviary, the door of which had been left open, broke into the apartment, quite scared, flying round the chandelier, knocking against the window-panes and against the furniture, and some of them, alighting on the heads of the guests, presented the appearance there of large flowers.\n\nThe musicians had gone. The piano had been drawn out of the anteroom. The Vatnaz seated herself before it, and, accompanied by the choir-boy, who thumped his tambourine, she made a wild dash into a quadrille, striking the keys like a horse pawing the ground, and wriggling her waist about, the better to mark the time. The Mar\u00e9chale dragged out Frederick; Hussonnet took the windmill; the 'longshorewoman put out her joints like a circus-clown; the merry-andrew exhibited the man\u0153uvres of an orang-outang; the female savage, with outspread arms, imitated the swaying motion of a boat. At last, unable to go on any further, they all stopped; and a window was flung open.\n\nThe broad daylight penetrated the apartment with the cool breath of morning. There was an exclamation of astonishment, and then came silence. The yellow flames flickered, making the sockets of the candlesticks crack from time to time. The floor was strewn with ribbons, flowers, and pearls. The pier-tables were sticky with the stains of punch and syrup. The hangings were soiled, the dresses rumpled and dusty. The plaits of the women's hair hung loose over their shoulders, and the paint, trickling down with the perspiration, revealed pallid faces and red, blinking eyelids.\n\nThe Mar\u00e9chale, fresh as if she had come out of a bath, had rosy checks and sparkling eyes. She flung her wig some distance away, and her hair fell around her like a fleece, allowing none of her uniform to be seen except her breeches, the effect thus produced being at the same time comical and pretty.\n\nThe Sphinx, whose teeth chattered as if she had the ague, wanted a shawl.\n\nRosanette rushed up to her own room to look for one, and, as the other came after her, she quickly shut the door in her face.\n\nThe Turk remarked, in a loud tone, that M. Oudry had not been seen going out. Nobody noticed the maliciousness of this observation, so worn out were they all.\n\nThen, while waiting for vehicles, they managed to get on their broad-brimmed hats and cloaks. It struck seven. The angel was still in the dining-room, seated at the table with a plate of sardines and fruit stewed in melted butter in front of her, and close beside her was the fishwife, smoking cigarettes, while giving her advice as to the right way to live.\n\nAt last, the cabs having arrived, the guests took their departure. Hussonnet, who had an engagement as correspondent for the provinces, had to read through fifty-three newspapers before his breakfast. The female savage had a rehearsal at the theatre; Pellerin had to see a model; and the choir-boy had three appointments. But the angel, attacked by the preliminary symptoms of indigestion, was unable to rise. The medi\u00e6val baron carried her to the cab.\n\n\"Take care of her wings!\" cried the 'longshorewoman through the window.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, Mademoiselle Vatnaz said to Rosanette:\n\n\"Good-bye, darling! That was a very nice evening party of yours.\"\n\nThen, bending close to her ear: \"Take care of him!\"\n\n\"Till better times come,\" returned the Mar\u00e9chale, in drawling tones, as she turned her back.\n\nArnoux and Frederick returned together, just as they had come. The dealer in fa\u00efence looked so gloomy that his companion wished to know if he were ill.\n\n\"I? Not at all!\"\n\nHe bit his moustache, knitted his brows; and Frederick asked him, was it his business that annoyed him.\n\n\"By no means!\"\n\nThen all of a sudden:\n\n\"You know him\u2014P\u00e8re Oudry\u2014don't you?\"\n\nAnd, with a spiteful expression on his countenance:\n\n\"He's rich, the old scoundrel!\"\n\nAfter this, Arnoux spoke about an important piece of ware-making, which had to be finished that day at his works. He wanted to see it; the train was starting in an hour.\n\n\"Meantime, I must go and embrace my wife.\"\n\n\"Ha! his wife!\" thought Frederick. Then he made his way home to go to bed, with his head aching terribly; and, to appease his thirst, he swallowed a whole carafe of water.\n\nAnother thirst had come to him\u2014the thirst for women, for licentious pleasure, and all that Parisian life permitted him to enjoy. He felt somewhat stunned, like a man coming out of a ship, and in the visions that haunted his first sleep, he saw the shoulders of the fishwife, the loins of the 'longshorewoman, the calves of the Polish lady, and the head-dress of the female savage flying past him and coming back again continually. Then, two large black eyes, which had not been at the ball, appeared before him; and, light as butterflies, burning as torches, they came and went, ascended to the cornice and descended to his very mouth.\n\nFrederick made desperate efforts to recognise those eyes, without succeeding in doing so. But already the dream had taken hold of him. It seemed to him that he was yoked beside Arnoux to the pole of a hackney-coach, and that the Mar\u00e9chale, astride of him, was disembowelling him with her gold spurs.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[6] A little over three miles.\u2014Translator.\n\n[7] Mondor was a celebrated Italian charlatan, who, in the seventeenth century, settled in Paris and made a large fortune.\u2014Translator.\n\n[8]\n\"Elle repara\u00eetra, la terrible Assembl\u00e9e,\nDont, apr\u00e8s quarante ans, votre t\u00eate est troubl\u00e9e,\nColosse qui sans peur marche d'un pas puissant.\"\n\n[9] This probably refers to the English astronomer of that name.\u2014Translator.\n\n[10] The \"Porcherons\" was the name given to an old quarter of Paris famous for its taverns, situated between the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre and the Rue de Saint-Lazare.\u2014Translator.", "http://genius.com/Gustave-flaubert-sentimental-education-chap-7-annotated"], "1355694": ["The Toronto Song by\u00a0Three\u00a0Dead Trolls In A Baggie", "The Toronto Song Lyrics\n\nI hate the skydome and the CN tower too\nI hate Nathan Phillip's square and the Ontario Zoo\nThe rent's too high, the air's unclean\nThe beaches are dirty and the people are mean\nAnd the women are big and the men are dumb\nAnd the children are loopy cuz they live in a slum!\nThe water is polluted and their mayor's a dork\nThey dress real bad and they think they're New York\nIn Toronto, Ontario-o-o\n\nYou know, actually, I, I think I pretty much hate all of Ontario\n(Oh yeah, me too!)\nI hate Thunder Bay and Ottawa, Kitchener, Windsor, and Oshawa\nLondon sucks and the Great Lakes suck and Sarnia sucks and Turkey point sucks\n\nI took a trip to Ontario to visit Brian Mulroney\n(Moosonee sucks and Beaverton sucks and Brighton sucks and Guelph sucks too)\nHe beat me up and he stole my pants and he put me in a tree\n\n(Peterborough, Narva, and [inaudible] suck, [inaudible] and Uxbridge suck!)\nI went to see the Maple Leafs and got hit in the head with a puck\n(Ah, I-I don't even know how they did it really, I mean, I was playing the organ at the time!)\nONTARIO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O SUCKS\n\nYep, actually now that I think about it\nI think I pretty much hate every gosh darn province and territory in our country\nOh yeah-except Alberta!

Directly we speak of tendencies or movements we commit to, the belief that there is some force, in\ufb02uence, outer pressure that is strong enough to stamp itself upon a whole group of different writers so that all their writing has a certain common likeness.\n\n\u2014Virginia Woolf, \u201cThe Leaning Tower,\u201d lecture delivered to the Workers\u2019 Educational Association, Brighton (May 1940)CONTEXTS AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY 322\nINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY:\nCAI BEGINNINGS 324\nCOGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI RESEARCH 325\nKINDS OF DIGITAL MEDIA LEARNING 327\nPIONEERING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 346\nCHALLENGING QUESTIONS 351\nCONCLUSION 356\nREFERENCES 358\n\nWith full acknowledgement of the warning from the 1940 lecture by Virginia Woolf, this chapter begins by presenting a theory of mind, knowing only too well, that \u201ca whole group of different\u201d learning theorists cannot \ufb01nd adequate coverage under one umbrella. Nor should they. However, there is a movement occurring, a form of social activism created by the affordances of social media, an infrastructure that was built incrementally during two to three decades of hard scholarly research that brought us to this historic time and place. To honor the convergence of theories and technologies, this paper revisits the Points of Viewing Theory to provide researchers, teachers, and the public with an opportunity to discuss and perhaps change the epistemology of education from its formal structures to more Do-It-Yourself (DIY) learning environments that dig deeper and better into content knowledge. As the saying goes, we live in interesting times. Let\u2019s not make this saying a curse. Let\u2019s \u201cdeschool\u201d society as Ivan Illich suggested in 1971 and design more equitable systems of learning across mediated platforms.\n\nThe Points of Viewing Theory (POV-T) is the foundation on which this chapter on computers, the Internet, social media, embodied cognition, and interactive digital media learning environments, including games for learning, is constructed. According to this theory developed by Ricki Goldman (formerly Ricki Goldman-LSegall) learners actively layer their viewpoints and their interpretations to elicit patterns, themes, and groupings of ideas that lead to a deep understanding of the content under investigation and to reach agreements\u2014if only partial (Goldman, 2007; Goldman-Segall, 1996a, 1998a). POV-T is not limited to making meaning with from a solitary standpoint. Indeed, the purpose of applying POV-T is to enable learners to learn from one another by seeing each other\u2019s viewpoints through perspective-taking as well as to be able to see their own changing perspectives on a subject in diverse contexts and settings. As Rowland points out: \u201cWe come to know through interpretation, dialog, and negotiation of meaning with...others, through a conversation with manipulation of the materials of a situation\u201d (Rowland, 2004, p. 43).\n\nThe theory, \ufb01rst developed by Goldman in the 1990s, also strengthens content knowledge by layering the ideas of participants and stakeholders in a shared learning environment using a range of methods, tools, and \u201cdocuments.\u201d POV-T also provides a framework for \ufb01nding underlying patterns that lead to agreements. Tools that make evident this theory are called perspectivity technologies because they provide a platform for multiloguing (Goldman-Segall, 1994), a place and space for building cultures or communities of practice where one \u201ccatches sight\u201d of the other while participating in learning. Given the problematics of living in a complex global society facing enormous cultural, social, environmental, and economic differences of opinion, this theory is critical for communicating with each other and reaching what Ivan Illich calls conviviality (1973), Clifford Geertz calls commensurability (1973), and Goldman-Segall (1995) calls con\ufb01gurational validity\u2014a form of thick communication, which emerges from using media tools to layer views and perspectives into agreements.\n\nPOV-T incorporates how each person at different times and contexts will understand the same content whether it is a process, event, document in any media, or action \u201cwith new eyes.\u201d Research on what Black (2010) calls the embodied/grounded cognitive perspective takes advantage not only of our visual perceptual systems for learning, but also our entire full body perceptual systems. Recent brain scanning research has shown that many cognitive tasks that were thought to be purely symbolic actually involved a multisensory perceptual simulation. The best preparation for such task requires a fully embodied learning experience. The use of computer game-like learning environments (such as the Wii and Kinect) will continue to open the doors for exploration into how the social mind makes sense of experiences. Moreover, given the rise of social media and games for learning, as well as the recent \ufb01ndings on the plasticity of mental interpretations, the brain\u2019s capacity for mental mirroring, and the intimate relationship between emotion and social intelligence that shows how minds can be recon\ufb01gured with changes to embodied experiences, the Points of Viewing Theory, a foundational theory of minds presented in this chapter, is the one that can move forward our understanding of learning with computers from the advent of early instructionist approaches to more recent constructionist and socioconstructionist applications.\n\nIn this chapter, the authors explore a range of concepts and tools that have been designed for learning. The authors expect that readers will create new con\ufb01gurations as they read the text. Indeed, that is the idea behind the theory\u2014to learn from both a layering of each other\u2019s ideas as well as from the diverse perspectives each of us, as solitary readers (if there is such a thing) can make meaning of different contexts to build knowledge, together.\n\nCONTEXTS AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY\n\nWe start by unfolding how the Points of Viewing Theory provides us with a lens from which to better connect the writings of past and present leading theorists. We do this to tease out some of the sticky webs that confuse policy makers and academicians, as well as to envision future directions. The underlying theme running through this chapter is that many routes combining a vast array of perspectives are needed to shape an educationally sound approach to learning and teaching with digital media technologies. There is no one \ufb01x, no one solution. Rather, there must be an openness to appreciate diversity and a layering of points of viewing.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the age-old debate between empiricism and idealism shifted: science could be used to not only observe the external world with microscopes and telescopes, but also to change, condition, and control behavior. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov experimented with dogs, calling his theory conditioning. Dogs \u201clearned\u201d to salivate to the sound of a bell that had previously accompanied their eating, even without receiving the food. Pavlov\u2019s theory of conditioning played a central role in inspiring John B. Watson, who is often cited as the founder of behaviorist psychology. In 1913, Watson, while continuing to work with animals, applied Pavlov\u2019s theories to children, believing that people act according to the stimulation of their nervous system and can just as easily as dogs be conditioned to learn. A turbulent personal turn of events\u2014leading to his dismissal from Johns Hopkins University\u2014extended Watson\u2019s behaviorist approach into the domain of marketing. He landed a prime job as vice-president of J. Walter Thompson, one of the largest U.S. advertising companies, and helped change the course of advertising forever (Daniels, 2000). As media, education, and business enter a convergent course in this 21st century with new tools for learning and the new knowledge industry, behaviorist theories remain a strong and silent partner y.\n\nA leading proponent of behaviorism, Edward Thorndike, with his 1899 article on \u201cAnimal Intelligence\u201d and subsequent book Educational Psychology in 1903, is often called the founder of the \ufb01eld of educational psychology. His educational psychology book made recommendations for teaching students, based on his research on animals (the Law of Effect and the Law of Exercise that establish connections between stimuli and responses). (He conducted studies with students, and not only animals, using this same basic framework.) The leading behaviorist in the educational domain, Burrhus Frederic (B.F.) Skinner, contributed the idea of operant conditioning\u2014how positive and negative reinforcement (reward and punishment) can be used as stimuli to shape how humans respond. With this variation, the theory of behavior modi\ufb01cation was born. All human actions are seen to be shaped (caused) by the stimulus of the external world on the body. In short, there is no reasoning mind creating reality, merely a hard-wired system that responds to what it experiences from external sources. Infamous for designing the glass \u201cAir Crib,\u201d which his daughter\u2014observed, measured, and \u201ctaught\u201d how to behave\u2014spent time living in, Skinner not only practiced what he preached, but also led the way for even more elaborate experiments to prove how educators could shape, reinforce, and manipulate humans through repeated drills. Much of this early work resurfaced in electronic learning systems today.\n\nWhat was salient in the behaviorist approach was that the proponents addressed the role of external stimuli\u2014that our bodies send messages to the brain that can be interpreted. What was missed was selectivity of the brain in interpreting how perceptions affect not only behavior, but create new perspectives layered on both internal predispositions and previously acquired interpreted experiences. In this chapter we propose that interactions among genetics, experience, and ongoing perceptual reactions along with what is felt in the whole body and interpreted in the mind are paramount to learning.\n\nIn short, even with the advent of new man-machine studies in the post\u2013World War II period, the role of perspectivity has been missing as a key part of the interpretive executive functioning of the brain Nevertheless, with the advent of the computer, intrepid behavioral scientists persisted in designing and using drill-and-practice methods to improve memorization tasks (e.g., Suppes, 1966). They turned to an examination of the role and ef\ufb01cacy of computers and technology in education, a subject understood in a behaviorist research agenda that valued measurable results and formal experimental methods, as Koschmann (1996, pp. 5\u20136) notes in his critique of the period. Accordingly, proponents of Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s asked how the computer (an external stimulus) affects (modi\ufb01es) the individual (a hard-wired learning system). Their research questions focused on how the process of learning could be improved by using the computer.\n\nWe see these classic debates between empiricism and idealism as being connected with bifurcation and a dualistic world view. It was not possible at the time to understand how the working of the brain, a network of perceptions, could be connected with perspectives, the interpretations that people as individuals and as a society, make. In short, an embodied notion of how learning is not internally nor externally \u201clocated.\u201d A holistic view of the world did not seem possible then, and for many scholars today, unfortunately, it still is an enigma.\n\nAn alternative approach to CAI is rooted in studying the individual mind and conducting experiments on how the mind works. The mind as a site of research (and not just idealization or speculation) has its modern roots in the work of Jean Piaget (b. 1896), a natural scientist trained in zoology but most renowned for his work as a developmental psychologist and epistemologist. After becoming disillusioned with standardized testing methodology at the Sorbonne in France, Piaget returned to Geneva in 1921 to dedicate the rest of his academic life to studying the child\u2019s conception of time (Piaget, 1969), space (Piaget & Inhelder, 1956), number (Piaget 1952) and the world (Piaget, 1930). Although the idea that children could do things at one age that they could not do at another was not new, it was Piaget who was able to lay out a blueprint for children\u2019s conceptual development at different stages of their lives. For example, the classic theory of conservation eludes the young child: a tall glass contains more water than a short one even if the young child pours the same water from one glass into the other. Until Piaget, no one had conducted a body of experiments asking children to think about these phenomena and then mapped the diverse views that children use to solve problems into categories. By closely observing, recording his observations, and applying these to an emerging developmental theory of mind, Piaget and his team of researchers in Geneva developed the famous hierarchy of thinking stages: sensori-motor, preoperational, concrete, and formal. Piaget did not limit all thinking into these four rigid categories but rather used them as a way to deepen discussion on how children learn.\n\nWhat is fundamentally different in Piaget\u2019s conception of mind is that unlike the behaviorist view that the external world affects the individual\u2014a uni-directional approach with no input from the individual\u2014the process of constructivist learning occurs in the mind of the child encountering, exploring, and theorizing about the world as the world is encountered as it moved through preset stages of life. The child\u2019s mind assimilates new events into existing cognitive structures and the cognitive structures accommodate the new event, changing the existing structures in a continually interactive process. Schema are formed as the child assimilates new events and moves from a state of disequilibrium to equilibrium, a state only to be put back into disequilibrium every time the child meets new experiences that cannot \ufb01t the existing schema. Beers (2001) has called the assimilation/accommodation process a dialectical inter-action among person, objects of creation (artifacts), and the curricular world in which the artifacts are created.\n\nHowever, Piaget also believed that learning is a spontaneous, individual cognitive process, distinct from the sort of socialized and nonspontaneous instruction one might \ufb01nd in formal education, and that these two are in a somewhat antagonistic relationship. Critiquing Piaget\u2019s constructivism, the great Soviet psychologist L. S. Vygotsky wrote:\n We believe that the two processes\u2014the development of spontaneous and of nonspontaneous concepts\u2014are related and constantly in\ufb02uence each other. They are parts of a single process: the development of concept formation, which is affected by varying external and internal conditions but is essentially a unitary process, not a con\ufb02ict of antagonistic, mutually exclusive forms of mentation. (Vygotsky, 1962, p. 85)Vygotsky heralded a departure from individual mind to social mind, and, as under his in\ufb02uence, educational theorizing moved away from its individual-focused origins and toward more socially or culturally situated perspectives. The paradigmatic approaches of key theorists in learning technology re\ufb02ect this change as contributions from anthropology and social psychology gained momentum throughout the social sciences. The works of Vygotsky and the Soviet cultural-historical school (notably A. R. Luria and A. N. Leontiev), when translated into English, began to have a major in\ufb02uence, especially through the interpretations and stewardship of educational psychologists like Sylvia Scribner, Jerome Bruner, and Michael Cole (Bruner, 1990; Cole & Engestrom, 1993; Cole & Wertsch, \u00a81996; Scribner & Cole, 1981). Vygotsky focused on the role of social context and mediating tools (language, writing, etc.) in the development of the individual, and argued that one cannot study the mind of a child without examining the \u201csocial milieu, both institutional and interpersonal\u201d in which she \ufb01nds herself (Katz & Lesgold, 1993). Vygotsky\u2019s in\ufb02uence, along with that of pragmatist philosopher John Dewey\u2019s seminal Democracy in Education (1916), opened up the study of technology in learning beyond individual cognition, thereby revealing its role in fostering social interaction and the betterment of a diverse, interconnected society. The ground in the last decade of the 20th century thus became fertile for a growing range of new media and computational environments for learning, teaching, and research based on new advances in brainbased cognitive science coupled with a socially mediated and distributed approach to the acqusition of knowledge (Pea & Bransford et al., 2000). This critical dichotomy between postpositivism and interpretivism would provide the philosophical inspiration for learning sciences research on technology in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century. But the path to social constructionism at the end of the 20th century \ufb01rst took a circuitous route through computeraided instruction.\n\nINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY:\nCAI BEGINNINGS\n\nAn examination of the theoretical roots of computers in education exposes its behaviorist beginnings: The computer could reinforce activities that would bring about more ef\ufb01cient learning. For some, this meant \u201ccheaper,\u201d for others, \u201cfaster,\u201d and for yet others, it meant without needing a teacher (see Bromley, 1998, for a discussion). The oldest such tradition of computing in education is Computer-Aided Instruction, or CAI. This approach dates back to the early 1960s, notably in two research projects, at Stanford under Patrick Suppes (1966), and the PLATO project at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under Donald Bitzer and Dan Alpert (1970). Both projects utilized the then-new \u201ctime-sharing\u201d computer systems to create learning opportunities for individual students. The potential existed for a time-sharing system to serve hundreds or even thousands of students simultaneously, and this economy of scale was one of the main drivers of early CAI research. A learner could sit at a terminal and engage in a textual dialogue with the computer system: question and answer. As such, CAI can be situated mostly within the behavioral paradigm (Koschmann, 1996, p. 6), though its research is also informed by cognitive science (e.g., Suppes applied new cognitive learning and memory theories to guide the interactions with students).\n\nThe Stanford CAI project explored elementary school mathematics and science education, and the researchers worked with local schools to produce a formidable amount of research data (Suppes, Jerman, & Brian, 1968; Suppes & Morningstar, 1972). Suppes began with tutorial instruction as the key model, and saw that the computer could provide individualized tutoring on a far greater scale than was economically possible before. Suppes envisioned computer tutoring on three levels: the simplest is drill-and-practice work, in which the computer administers a question-and-answer session with the student, judging responses correct or incorrect, and keeping track of data from the sessions. The second level was a more direct instructional approach: The computer would give information to the student, and then quiz the student on the information, possibly allowing for different constructions or expressions of the same information. In this sense, the computer acts much like a textbook. The third level was to be more sophisticated dialogic systems, in which a more traditional tutor-tutee relationship could be emulated (Suppes, 1966). Clearly, the simple drill-and practice model is the easiest to actually implement, and as such the bulk of the early Stanford research uses this model, especially in the context of elementary school arithmetic (Suppes et al., 1968).\n\nThe research results from the Stanford experiments are not surprising: students do tend to improve over time with practice. For the time (the 1960s), however, to be able to automate the process was a signi\ufb01cant achievement. More interesting from our perspective are the re\ufb02ections Suppes offers, regarding the design of the human-computer interface: How and when should feedback be given? How can the system be tailored to different cognitive styles? How best to leverage the unprecedented amount of quantitative data the system collected about each student\u2019s performance and progress? (Suppes, 1966). These questions still form the cornerstone of much educational technology research.\n\nThe PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) project at UIUC had a somewhat different focus (Alpert & Bitzer, 1970). Over several incarnations of the PLATO system through the 1960s, Bitzer, Alpert, and their team worked at the problems of integrating CAI into university teaching on a large scale, as indeed it began to be from the late 1960s. The task of taking what was then enormously expensive equipment and systems and making it economically viable in order to have individualized tutoring for students drove the development of the systems, and led PLATO to a long career in CAI\u2014in fact, the direct descendants of the original PLATO system are still being used and developed. The PLATO project introduced some of the \ufb01rst instances of computer-based manipulables, student-to-student conferencing, and computer-based \u201cdistance\u201d education (Woolley, 1994).\n\nFrom these beginnings, CAI and the models it provides for educational technology are now the oldest tradition in educational computing. While only partly integrated in the school system, CAI is widely used in corporate training environments, in remedial programs, and has had something of a resurgence with the advent of the World Wide Web as online training has become popular. It is worth noting that the company Suppes started with Richard Atkinson at Stanford in 1967, Computer Curriculum Corporation, and NovaNet, a PLATO descendant spun off from UIUC in 1993 were both recently acquired by Pearson Education, the world\u2019s largest educational publisher (Pearson Education, 2000).\nCOGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI RESEARCH\nIn order to historically situate the development of learning technology, it is also important to appreciate the impact of the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d (Gardner, 1985) on both education and technology.\n\nFor our purposes, the contribution of cognitive science is twofold. First, the advent of the digital computer in the 1940s led quickly to research on arti\ufb01cial intelligence(AI). By the 1950s, AI was already a substantial research program at universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. And while AI research has not yet\u2014nor, we believe, is likely to\u2014produced an arti\ufb01cial mind, the legacy of AI research has had an enormous in\ufb02uence on our presentday computing paradigms, from information management to feedback and control systems and from personal computing to the notion of programming languages. All derive in large part from a full half-century of research in AI.\n\nSecond, cognitive science\u2014speci\ufb01cally the contributions of Piagetian developmental psychology and AI research\u2014gave the world the \ufb01rst practical models of mind, thinking, and learning. Prior to the cognitive revolution, our understanding of thinking was oriented either psychoanalytically or philosophically, out of the Western traditions of metaphysics and epistemology, or empirically, via behaviorism. In the latter case, as mentioned earlier, cognition was regarded as a black box between stimulus and response. Since no empirical study of the contents of this box was possible, speculation as to what went on inside was both discouraged and ignored. Cognitive science, especially by way of AI research, opened the box. For the \ufb01rst time, researchers could work from a model of mind and mental processes. In 1957, AI pioneer Herbert Simon went so far as to predict that AI would soon provide the substantive model for psychological theory, in the same way that Newton\u2019s calculus had once done for physics (Turkle, 1984, p. 244). Despite the subsequent humbling of AI\u2019s early enthusiasm, the effect this thinking has had on research in psychology and education and even the popular imagination (consider the commonplace notion of one\u2019s \u201cshort term memory\u201d) is vast.\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant thread or thrust of early AI research was Allen Newell and Herbert Simon\u2019s \u201cinformation processing\u201d model at Carnegie-Mellon University. This research sought to develop a generalized problem solving mechanism, based on the idea that problems in the world could be represented as internal states in a machine and operated on algorithmically. Newell and Simon saw the mind as a \u201cphysical symbol system\u201d or \u201cinformation processing system\u201d (Simon, 1981 [1969], p. 27), and believed that such a system is the \u201cnecessary and suf\ufb01cient means\u201d for intelligence (p. 28). One of the venerable traditions of this model is the chess-playing computer, long bandied as exemplary of intelligence. Ironically, world chess master Gary Kasparov\u2019s historic defeat to IBM\u2019s \u201cDeep Blue\u201d supercomputer in 1997 had far less rhetorical punch than AI critic (and chess novice) Hubert Dreyfus\u2019 defeat in 1965, but the legacy of the information processing approach cannot be underestimated.\n\nYet it would be unfair to equate all of classical AI research with Newell and Simon\u2019s approach. Signi\ufb01cantly, research programs at Stanford and MIT, though perhaps lower pro\ufb01le, made signi\ufb01cant contributions to the \ufb01eld. Two threads in particular are worthy of comment here. One was the development of \u201cexpert systems,\u201d concerned with the problem of knowledge representation\u2014 for example Edward Feigenbaum\u2019s DENDRAL, a system that contained large amounts of domain-speci\ufb01c information in biology. Another was Terry Winograd\u2019s 1970 program, SHRDLU, which \ufb01rst tackled the issue of indexicality and reference in an arti\ufb01cial microworld (Gardner,1985). As Gardner points out, these developments demonstrated that Newell and Simon\u2019s \u201cgeneralized\u201d problem-solving approach would give way to more situated, domain speci\ufb01c approaches.\n\nThe culmination of this approach results in the Cognitive Tutors out of Carnegie Mellon University. These are both a successful product widely used in schools  www.carnegielearning.com) and an active ongoing research project (coordinated through the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center: www.learnlab.org). The Cognitive Tutors apply John Anderson\u2019s ACTR (Anderson, 1993) cognitive architecture (which is descended from Newell and Simon\u2019s) to represent the knowledge to be taught (mostly If-Then production rules) then this knowledge is represented in the tutor so that it can understand what the student is doing when solving problems and provide \u201cintelligence\u201d feedback (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995). These tutors show impressive results in tests compared to classroom instruction and when compared to traditional CAI (like the Suppes kind): they do around one effect size (one standard deviation) better than classroom instruction\u2014tradition CAI does 0.3 effect size better than classroom instruction so the Cognitive Tutors are 3 times as effective as traditional CAI (J. Kulik & C. Kulik, 1991). However, these Cognitive Tutors are effective at teaching how to solve problems in areas like high school algebra and geometry; there is some question remaining whether they can also teach an understanding of why these solution methods work.\n\nAt MIT in the 1980s, Marvin Minsky\u2019s work led to a theory of the \u201csociety of minds\u201d\u2014that, rather than intelligence being constituted in a straightforward representational and algorithmic way, intelligence is seen as the emergent property of a complex of subsystems working independently (Minsky, 1986). The notion of emergent AI, more recently explored through massively parallel computers, has with the availability of greater computing power in the 1980s and 1990s become the mainstream of AI research (Turkle, 1995, pp. 126\u2013127). Interestingly, Gardner (1985) points out that the majority of computing\u2014and therefore AI\u2014 research has been located within the paradigm de\ufb01ned by Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and George Boole in the 19th century. Babbage and Lovelace are commonly credited with the basic idea\nof the programmable computer; Lady Ada Agusta, Countess of Lovelace (also known as Ada Lovelace), in famous quote in Note 6 of her translation of the 1842 paper by L. F. Menabrea\u2014written more than 170 years ago, called Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, neatly sums it up:\nThe analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.George Boole\u2019s contribution was the notion that a system of binary states (0 and 1) could suf\ufb01ce for the representation and transformation of logical propositions. But computing research began to \ufb01nd and transcend the limits of this approach. The rise of emergent AI was characterized as \u201cwaking up from the Boolean dream\u201d (Douglas Hofstadter, quoted in Turkle, p., 135). In this model, intelligence is seen as a property emergent from, or at least observable in, systems of suf\ufb01cient complexity. Intelligence is thus not de\ufb01ned by programmed rules, but by adaptive behavior within an environment.\n\nFrom internal representation to situated action. The idea of taking contextual factors seriously became important outside of pure AI research as well. A notable example was the reception given to Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s famous program, ELIZA. When it \ufb01rst appeared in 1966, ELIZA was not intended as serious AI; it was an experiment in creating a simple conversational interface to the computer\u2014outputting canned statements in response to certain \u201ctrigger\u201d phrases inputted by a user. But ELIZA, with her re\ufb02ective responses sounding a bit like a Rogerian analyst, became something of a celebrity\u2014much to Weizenbaum\u2019s horror (Turkle, 1995, p. 105). The popular press and even some psychiatrists took ELIZA quite seriously. Weizenbaum argued against ELIZA\u2019s use as a psychiatric tool, and against mixing up human beings and computers in general, but ELIZA\u2019s fame has endured. The interface and relationship that ELIZA demonstrates has proved signi\ufb01cant in and of itself, regardless of what computational sophistication may or may not lie behind it.\n\nAnother contextualist effort took place at Xerox\u2019 Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s, where a team led by Alan Kay developed the foundation for the \u201cpersonal computing\u201d paradigm we know today. Kay\u2019s team is most famous for developing the mouse-and-windows interface\u2014which Brenda Laurel (1990) later called the direct manipulation interface. However, at a more fundamental level, the Xerox PARC researchers de\ufb01ned a model of computing that branched away from a formalist, rulesdriven approach, and toward a notion of the computer as curriculum: an environment for designing, creating, and using digital tools. This approach partly came from explicitly thinking of children as the designers of computing technology. Kay wrote:\nWe were thinking about learning as being one of the mainn effects we wanted to have happen. Early on, this led to a 90-degree rotation of the purpose of the user interface from \u201caccess to functionality\u201d to \u201cenvironment in which users learn by doing.\u201d This new stance could now respond to the echoes of Montessori and Dewey, particularly the former, and got me, on rereading Jerome Bruner, to think beyond the children\u2019s curriculum to a \u201ccurriculum of user interface.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)In the late 1980s, Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores\u2019 Understanding Computers and  ognition: A New Foundation for Design (1986) heralded a new direction in AI and intelligent systems design. Instead of a rationalist, computational model of mind, Winograd and Flores described the emergence of a decentered and situated approach. The book drew on the phenomenological thinking of Martin Heidegger, the biology of perception work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and the speech-act theory of John Austin and John Searle to call for a situated model of mind-in-the-world, capable of (or dependent on) commitment and intentionality in real relationships. Winograd and Flores\u2019 work raised signi\ufb01cant questions about the assumptions of a functionalist, representational model of cognition, arguing that such a view is based on highly questionable assumptions about the nature of human thought and action.\n\nIn short, the question of how these AI and cognitive science developments have affected the role of technology in the educational arena can be summed up in the ongoing debate between instructionist \u201ctutoring\u201d systems and constructivist \u201ctoolkits.\u201d While the earliest applications of AI to instructional systems attempted to operate by creating a model of knowledge or a problem domain and then managing a student\u2019s progress in terms of deviation from that model (Suppes, 1966; Wenger, 1987), later and arguably more sophisticated construction systems looked more like toolkits for exploring and re\ufb02ecting on one\u2019s thinking in a particular realm (Papert, 1980; Brown & Burton, 1978;Lajoi and Derry, 1993).\n\nKINDS OF DIGITAL MEDIA LEARNING\n\nWhen theorizing about the role of digital media learning environments in learning, the tendency is often to use an instrumentalist and instructionist approach\u2014the computer, for example, is a useful tool for gathering or presenting information (which is often and incorrectly equated with knowledge). Even within the constructionist paradigm, the social dimension of the learning experience is forgotten, focusing only on the individual child. And, even when we remember the Vygotskian zone of proximal development (ZPD) with its emphasis on the socially mediated context of learning, we tend to overlook the differences that individuals themselves have in their learning styles when they approach the learning experience. And even when we consider group and individual differences, we fail to examine that individuals themselves try out many styles depending on the knowledge domain being studied and the context within which they are participating. And, most importantly, even when the idea that individuals have diverse points of viewing the world is acknowledged, technologists and new media designers often do little to construct learning environments that truly encourage social construction and knowledge creation.\n\nDesigning and building tools as perspectivity technologies, we argue, enables learners to participate as members of communities experiencing and creating new worlds from the points of viewing of their diverse personal identities while contributing to the public good of the digital commons. Using perspectivity technologies, learners\u2014like stars in a constellation\u2014are connected to each other within a force that enables them to change their position and viewpoint yet stay linked within the larger and also moveable construct of the total con\ufb01guration of many constellations, galaxies, and universes. It is within the elastic tension among all the players in the community\u2014the learner, the teacher, the content, the artifacts created, and most importantly the context of the forces within which they communicate\u2014that new knowledge in, around, and about the world is created.\n\nThe next section has been organized less chronologically and more functionally, examining technologies from a variety of perspectives: as information sources, curricular areas, communications media, tools, environments, partners, scaffolds, and \ufb01nally, as perspectivity toolkits.\n\nWe also return to the importance of using the Points of Viewing Theory as a framework for designing new media applications and tools. These assorted technology approaches are not intended to be mutually exclusive; they are headers that often illustrate one aspect of a technology from a particular angle. How a technology should be characterized depends on how it used in situ. A learning technology may be designed in a monological fashion while in the context of use it becomes dialogical with the presence of human actors (Bakhtin, 1981; Wegerif, 2007). And vice versa\u2014technologies designed from a social constructionist framework may \ufb01nd their promise betrayed if used to serve instructionist goals and a single prevailing world view. With the explosion of ubiquitous learning with handheld devices in recent years, eroding the\ntraditional distinction between formal and informal learning, the potential for complex, meaningful, dialogically rich learning is greater than it has ever been (Burbules, Q1 2009). Within this context, it is essential to consider how perspectivity technologies can better accommodate these changes and provide a guiding light for future research and development.\n\nDigital Media for Information\n\nWhen we investigate how meaning is made, we can no longer assume that actual social meanings, materially made, consist only in the verbal-semantic and linguistic contextualizations (paradigmatic, syntagmatic, intertextual) by which we have previously de\ufb01ned them. We must now consider that meaning-in-use organizes, orients, and presents, directly or implicitly, through the resources of multiple semiotic systems. (Lemke, 1998)\n\nAccess to information has been the dominant mythology of computers in education for many educators. Not taking the time to consider how new media texts bring with them new ways of understanding them, educators and educational technologists have often tried to add computers to learning as one would add salt to a meal. The idea of technology as information source has captured the imagination of school administrators, teachers, and parents hoping that problems of education could be solved by providing each student with access to the most current knowledge (Graves, 1999). It is no different these days: legislators and policy makers are still trying to bridge the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d As of 2012, the state of Maine is the only state in the United States with an Internet-connected computer on every desktop.\n\nAlthough a growing number of postmodern theorists and semioticians see computers and new media technologies astexts to deconstruct (Landow, 1992; Lemke, 2001), it is more common to see computers viewed as textbooks. In spite of Lemke\u2019s reminder that these new media texts require translation and not only digestion, the computer is commonly seen as merely a more ef\ufb01cient method of providing instruction and training, with information equated with knowledge. Learners working with courseware are presented with information and then tested or questioned on it, much as they would using traditional textbooks. The computer can automatically mark student responses to questions and govern whether or not the student moves on to the next section, freeing the teacher from this task\u2014an economic advantage noted by many educational technology thinkers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, multimedia\u2014audio, graphics, and video\u2014dominated the educational technology landscape. Curriculum and learning resources, \ufb01rst distributed as textbook and accompanying \ufb02oppy-disc, began to be distributed on videodisc or CD-ROM, media formats able to handle large amounts of multiple media information. In the best cases, multimedia resources employed hypertext or hypermedia (Landow, 1992; Swan, 1994) as navigation schemes, encouraging nonlinear traversal of content. Hypermedia, as such, represented a signi\ufb01cant break with traditional, linear instructional design models, encouraging users to explore resources by following links between discrete chunks of information rather than simply following a programmed course. One of the best early exemplars was Apple Computer\u2019s classic Visual Almanac: An Interactive Multimedia Kit (1989), which enabled students to explore rich multimedia vignettes about interesting natural phenomena as well as events from history and\nthe arts.\n\nThe rise of Internet and search engines such as Google has stimulated the production of computer-based curriculum resources once again. As a sort of universal multimedia platform, the web\u2019s ability to reach a huge audience very inexpensively has led to its widespread adoption in schools, training centers, corporations, and, signi\ufb01cantly, the home. More than packaged curriculum, however, the use of the Internet and World Wide Web as an open-ended research tool has had an enormous impact on classrooms. Since the software for browsing the web is free (or nearly free) and the technology and skills required to use it are so widespread, the costs of using the web as a research tool are largely limited to the costs of hardware and connectivity. This makes it an obvious choice for teachers and administrators often unsure of how to best allocate technology funds. The popular reputation of the web as a universal library or as access to the world\u2019s information (much more so that its reputation as a den of pornographers and pedophiles) has led to a popular mythology of children reaching \u201cbeyond the classroom walls\u201d to\ntap directly into rich information sources, communicate with scientists and experts, and expand their horizons to a global view. Of course, such discourse needs to be examined in the light of day: the web is a source of bad information as well as good, and we must also remember that downloading is not equivalent to learning. As early as 2000, Roger Schank observed that,\n\n[A]ccess to the Web is often cited as being very important to education, for example, but is it? The problem in the schools is not that the libraries are insuf\ufb01cient. The Web is, at its best, an improvement on information access. It provides a better library for kids, but the library wasn\u2019t what was broken. (Schank, 2000)\n\nIndeed he made a good point that the problem is elsewhere, yet within a short decade the \u201cpossibility\u201d of better use of the access to a universe of materials has arrived. In a similar vein, \u201ccorrespondence schools\u201d\u2014both university-based and private businesses dating back to the 19th century\u2014are mirrored in today\u2019s crop of online distance learning providers (Noble, 1999).\n\nIn the classic distance education model, a student enrolls, receives curriculum materials in the mail, works through the material and submits assignments to an \u201cinstructor\u201d or \u201ctutor\u201d by mail. Hopefully, the student completes everything successfully and receives accreditation. Adding computers and networks to this model changes little, except for lowering the costs of delivery and management substantially (consider the cost savings of replacing human tutor/markers with an AI system). Again, in one decade it is not uncommon for leading universities to offer high-quality online degrees. Most programs have some courses that are available to students and the \u201cpush-back\u201d from resistant faculty who associated DoIt-Yourself (DIY) learning has all but disappeared. Anya Kamenetz\u2019s 2010 DIYU: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education became an instant read across higher education with blogs and tweets that raised fear throughout the academic establishment.\n\nThe title of a May 3, 2010, article in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Seth Godin was \u201cThe Coming Meltdown in Higher Education (as Seen by a Marketer).\u201d Jay Cross and colleagues  from the Internet Time Alliance, created the 2010 version of his \u201cunbook,\u201d which he and his friends call Working Smarter: Informal Learning in the Cloud. Updates to the unbook can be found regularly by Cross and friends at www.internettime.com. Despite this current groundswell, the basic pedagogical questions about education remain: To what extent do learners in isolation actually learn? The introduction of electronic communication and conferencing systems into distance education environments has no doubt be shown to improve student\u2019s experiences (Hiltz & Goldman, 2004), and this has certainly been a widespread Q2 development, but the economic and educational challenges driving online learning still make it an ambivalent choice for both students and educators concerned with the learning process and accreditation. It will take a new system of evaluation of credentials before institutional bricks and mortar will become even close to obsolete. After two decades of knowing introducing technologies into day-today work and study, institutions of higher education are \ufb01nally responding with full force to create new kinds of learning environments that include formal and informal learning (ateliers and open community labs) as well as online mixed with face-to-face (f2f) classroom learning.\n\nThe next major hurdle will be addressing global learning, a subject that New York University, for example, has moved into with full force with branches in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, not to mention satellite programs and infrastructure in Buenos Aires, Paris, London, Florence, Acra, Singapore, Prague, London, Tel Aviv, and more recently, Madrid. Digital Media for Literacy in STEM Economic urgency and a chronic labor shortage in IT (Information Technologies) and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professions and the increasingly changing needs for updating computers and networks in the workplace continue to drive the demands for gaining design and computational literacy.\n\nLearning in both formal and informal settings, including businesses and schools, requires access to information and people who can design, built, and create curricular learning environments in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary areas. Although the \ufb01eld of technology studies as a program area has existed in high schools and universities since the 1970s, it is interesting how much variation there is in the curriculum, across grade levels, from region to region, and from school to school\u2014perhaps increasingly so as years go by. Apart from the U.S. College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Curriculum, which is focused on professional computer programming, what one school or teacher implements as the \u201ccomputer science\u201d or \u201cinformation technology\u201d curriculum is highly varied, and probably dependent on individual teachers\u2019 notions and attitudes toward what is important.\n\nThe range includes straightforward computer programming (as in the AP curriculum), multimedia production (Roschelle, Kaput, Stroup, & Kahn, 1998), technology management (Wolfson & Willinsky, 1998), exploratory learning (Harel & Papert, 1991), textbook learning about bits and bytes, and so on. Standards are hard to come by because the \ufb01eld is so varied and changing. A most straightforward conclusion one may draw from looking at our economy, workplace, and prospects for the future is that computer-based technologies are  increasingly part of how we work. It follows simply that knowing how to effectively use computers is a requirement for many jobs or careers. This basic idea drives the \u201cjob skills\u201d approach to computers in education. In this model, computer hardware and software, particularly of\ufb01ce productivity and data processing software are the cornerstone of technology curriculum, because skill with these applications is what \u201cemployers are looking for.\u201d One can \ufb01nd this model at work in most high schools and it is dominant in retraining and economic development programs.\n\nAnd although its simple logic is easy to grasp, perhaps this model is a reminder that simple  ideas can be limiting. Heeding this dilemma, Seymour Papert, invoking curriculum theorist Paolo Freire, writes,\nIf \u201ccomputer skill\u201d is interpreted in the narrow sense of technical knowledge about computers, there is nothing the children can learn now that is worth banking. By the time they grow up, the computer skills required in the workplace will have evolved into something fundamentally different. But what makes the argument truly ridiculous is that the very idea of banking computer knowledge for use one day in the workplace undermines the only really important \u201ccomputer skill\u201d: the skill and habit of using the computer in doing whatever one is doing. (Papert, 1992, p. 51)Papert\u2019s critique of computer skills leads to a discussion of \u201ccomputer literacy,\u201d a term almost as old as computers themselves, and one that is notoriously elusive. As far back as 1985, Douglas Noble noted that no one is sure what exactly computer literacy is, but everyone seems to agree that it is good for us (Noble, 1985, p. 64).\n\nSharon Derry and Daniel Zalles (2011) go beyond a theory of literacy to exploring how literacy is important for scienti\ufb01c civic reasoning. They propose \u201cthat active, collective citizenship through responsible civic reasoning, empowered by tools of science and technology, is an important educational goal of our time.\u201d They challenge the public to explore the connection between societal phenomenon and discipline-based science, using a sixstep approach: (1) seeking consensus around what is worth studying; (2) leveraging the power structures to ensure adequate funding; (3) operationalizing systematic research; (4) employing a \u201cculture of principled, unbiased, constructive critical discourse\u201d; (5) \ufb01nding evidence for setting policy and taking civic action; and (6) evaluating effectiveness. In short, they argue that a civil society requires that children be literate/\ufb02uent with both civics and technologies.\n\nWe suggest that the two books by John Willinsky, The New Literacy (1990) and The Access Principle: The Case of Open Access to Research and Scholarship (2006) expand on the idea that one needs to be \u201cliterate in literacy\u201d (p. 236), a phrase we now change to literate in digital literacies. Willinsky\u2019s The New Literacy emerges from the roots of popular culture, the Progressive Education Movement and even further back to the Romantics. It is grounded in the critical and yet inspirational work that can be reached through the thoughtful inquiry of teachers and students working together to rede\ufb01ne a new kind of learning place. In essence, the school becomes the language of this new literacy. Fifteen years later in The Access Principle, Willinsky focuses more on how we come to know and share what we know in open access digital environments.\n\nPointing to a long history to make knowledge public, Willinsky encourages the movement of cloistered knowledges held in most part by institutional repositories toward the democratization of knowledge.\n[A]n open access to scholarly publishing is not simply a side issues, a matter of bussiness plans and delivery systems, in the pursuit of truth.... Rather, the potential expansion in the circulation of ideas is much about the quality of truth pursued in such settings. I would argue that the global scale of knowledge\u2019s circulation is critical to its very claim as knowledge. (2006, p. 34).Certainly, Willinsky could not have predicted what came to be called the Arab Spring in 2011. In this time of protest against the existing regimes in individual countries (Tunesia, Egypt, Syria, etc.) that are embodied in the \ufb01ght for greater freedom across the Arab world, we can see how easy to use and accessible mobile technologies as well as social media software such as Twitter and Facebook gave access to information that led to communities sharing their perspectives and critiquing existing traditions of truth through a more negotiated understanding of what was felt and understood on the ground. Although it is unclear how the quality of truth can ever be reached in complex international con\ufb02icts, perhaps, what can be found in these contested spaces is incremental agreements that bring about verisimilitude, understanding, and a more general acceptance that differences of experiences and viewpoints can be negotiated through access to knowledge, resources, and power to make changes for the good of society, a quest that the Points of Viewing Theory was designed to facilitate. If Michel Foucault\u2019s book Power/Knowledge (1980) ever needed a rereading, it is in this particular time when our media tools help both laypeople and professionals interpret information in the quest to build a more just society.\n\nStill, in this chapter, we must address what the nature of computer literacy with new media technology in STEM learning in education is. Early attempts to de\ufb01ne computer literacy come from such in\ufb02uential \ufb01gures as J. C. R. Licklider, one of the founders of what is now the Internet, and whose notion of computer literacy drew much on John Dewey\u2019s ideas about a democratic populus of informed citizens. As computers became almost ubiquitous in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century, people began what now seems like a lifelong exploration to understand the role of these new technologies in their lives. The inevitable reduction of \u201ccomputer literacy\u201d to a laundry list of knowledge and skills (compare with E. D. Hirsch\u2019s controversial Cultural Literacy) prompted Papert to respond with appeals to the richness of what \u201cliteracy\u201d means:\nWhen we say \u201cX is a very literate person,\u201d we do not mean that X is highly skilled at deciphering phonics. At the least, we imply that X knows literature, but beyond this we mean that X has certain ways of understanding the world that derive from an acquaintance with literary culture. In the same way, the term computer literacy should refer to the kinds of knowing that derive from computer culture. (1992, p. 52, italics added)Other contributions to the notion of digital literacy remain rooted in the particular perspectives of their contributors. Alan Kay (1996) wrote of an \u201cauthoring literacy.\u201d Journalist Paul Gilster (2000) talked about \u201cdigital literacy.\u201d Andrea diSessa (1998; 2000), creator of the Boxer environment,  wrote extensively on \u201ccomputational literacy,\u201d a notion he projected that will rise above the banality of earlier conceptions.\n\nClearly, by computational literacy I do not mean a casual familiarity with a machine that  computes. In retrospect, I \ufb01nd it remarkable that society has allowed such a shameful debasing of the term literacy in its conventional use in connection with computers. (diSessa 2000, p. 5) Spiro, Collins, and Ramchandran (2007), an educational pioneer of how learning changes with hypermedia, multimedia, and now web-base interactive media, explained how learners become literate using the global and well-known approach called Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT). Using the following analogy of \u201ccrisscrossing landscapes,\u201d they weave a way for learners to gain \u201cdeep learning\u201d in knowledge domains that are \u201cillstructured.\u201d When one criss-crosses landscapes of knowledge in many directions (the main instructional metaphor of CFT, drawn from Wittgenstein, a revisiting is not a repeating. The result is knowledge representations whose strength is determined not by a single conceptual thread running through all or most parts of the domain\u2019s representation, but rather from the overlapping of many shorter conceptual \u201c\ufb01bers\u201d (Wittgenstein, 1953), as be\ufb01ts an ill-structured domain. (Spiro, Collins, & Ramchandran, 2007, p. 96)\n\nThe dif\ufb01culty of coming to terms with computer or digital literacy in any straightforward way has led Mary Bryson and Suzanne de Castell (1998) to identify the \u201cmiracle worker\u201d discourse that results, in which \u201cexperts\u201d are called on to step into a situation and implement the wonders that technology promises.\n[W]e hear that what is essential for the implementation and integration of technology in the classroom is that teachers should become \u201ccomfortable\u201d using it...we have a master code capable of utilizing in one platform what for the entire history of our species thus far has been irreducibly different kinds of things... every conceivable form of information can now be combined with every other kind to create a different form of communication, and what we seek is comfort and familiarity? (de Castell, Bryson, & Jenson, 2000, italics added)Familiarity and comfort, indeed! Bring on the affordances, they are proposing! However dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, some sense of \u201cliteracy\u201d is going to be an inescapable part of thinking about digital technology and learning. If we move beyond a simple instrumental view of the computer and what it can do, and take seriously how it changes the ways in which we relate to our world, then the issue of how we relate to such technologies, in the complex sense of a literacy, will remain crucial.\n\nDigital Media as Thinking Tool\nDavid Jonassen is perhaps best known in the educational technology domain as the educator connected with bringing to prominence the idea of computer as mind tool (1996, 2005). Breaking rank with his previous instructionist approach detailing what he termed frames for instruction (Duffy; Jonassen, 1992), Jonassen\u2019s later work re\ufb02ects the inspiration of leading constructionist thinkers like Seymour Papert. One of the classic quotations on the use of the computer as a tool from Papert\u2019s landmark book, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (1980), is:\nFor me, the phrase \u201ccomputer as pencil\u201d evokes the kind of uses I imagine children of the future making of computers. Pencils are used for scribbling as well as writing, doodling as well as drawing, for illicit notes as well as for of\ufb01cial assignments. (Papert, 210)Although Papert did not predict Facebook and Twitter, he did say that technologies of the future would enable \u201cillicit notes.\u201d Although it is easy to think of the computer as a simple tool\u2014a  technological device that we use to accomplish a certain task as we use a pen, abacus, canvas, ledger book, \ufb01le cabinet, and so on\u2014a tool can be much more than just a better pencil. It can be a vehicle for interacting with our intelligence\u2014a thinking tool and a creative tool. For example, a popular notion is that learning mathematics facilitates abstract and analytic thinking. This does not mean that mathematics can be equated with abstract thinking. The computer as a tool enables learners of mathematics to play with the elements that create the structures of the discipline. To use Papert\u2019s example, children using the Logo programming language explore mathematics and geometry by manipulating a virtual \u201cturtle\u201d on the screen to act out movements that form geometric entities (Papert, 1980). Children programming in Logo think differently about their thinking, becoming epistemologists. As Papert would say, Logo is not just a better pencil for doing mathematics but a tool for thinking more deeply about mathematics, by creating procedures and programs, structures within structures, constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed into larger wholes.\n\nPapert led a groundbreaking series of research projects that brought computing technology to schoolchildren using Logo. In Mindstorms, Papert explained that Logo puts children in charge of creating computational objects\u2014originally, by programming a mechanical \u201cturtle\u201d (a 1.5-foot-round object that could be programmed to move on the \ufb02oor and could draw a line on paper as it moved around), and then later a \u201cvirtual\u201d turtle that moved on the computer screen. A proteg\u00b4 e of Jean Piaget, Papert was concerned with the dif\ufb01cult transition from \u201cconcrete\u201d to \u201cformal\u201d thinking. Papert saw the computer as the tool that could make the abstract concrete:\nStated most simply, my conjecture is that the computer can concretize (and personalize) the formal. Seen in this light, it is not just another powerful educational tool. It is unique in providing us with the means for addressing what Piaget and many others see as the obstacle which is overcome in the passage from child to adult thinking. (Papert, 1980, p. 21)Beyond Piaget\u2019s notion of constructivism, the theory of constructionism focused its lens less on the stages of thought production and more on the artifacts that learners build as creative expressions of their understanding.\n\nPapert understood the computer as not merely being a tool (in the sense of a hammer) but as an object-to-think-with that facilitates novel ways of thinking. Constructionism\u2014the N word as opposed to the V word\u2014 shares constructivism\u2019s connotation of learning as building knowledge structures irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it\u2019s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (Papert,1991, p. 1)\n\nBy the late 1980s, the research conducted by the Learning and Epistemology Research Group at MIT was one of the most in\ufb02uential forces in learning technology research. A large-scale intensive research project called Project Headlight was conducted at the Hennigan School in Boston, studying all manner of phenomena around the experience of schoolchildren and Logo-equipped computers. A snapshot of this research is found in the edited volume, Constructionism (Harel & Papert, 1991), which covers the perspectives of sixteen researchers. For example, Aaron Falbel and Ricki Goldman-Segall situated their research in Illich\u2019s theory of conviviality as described in Tools for Conviviality (Illich, 1973)\u2014a theory that, in its simplest form, recommends tools be simple to use, accessible to all, and bene\ufb01cial for humankind. Falbel worked with children to create animation from original drawings and to think of themselves as convivial learners (Falbel, 19XX). Goldman-Segall conducted a three-year\ndigital video ethnography of children\u2019s thinking styles in computer-rich learning cultures and created a computerbased video analysis tool called Learning Constellations to analyze her video cases (1990). In Judy Sachter\u2019s work, children explored their understanding of  three-dimensional rotation and computer graphics, leading the way for understanding how children understand gaming (Sachter, 19XX).\n\nAt the same time, Mitchell Resnick, Steve Ocko, and Fred Martin designed smart LEGO bricks (crickets) controlled by Logo ((Martin, 1995; Martin & Resnick, 1993; Resnick & Ocko, 1991). These Lego objects could be programmed to move according to Logo commands. Researcher Nira Granott asked adult learners to deconstruct how and why these Lego robotic creatures moved in the way they did. Her goal was to understand the construction of internal cognitive structures that allow an interactive relationship between creator and user (Granott,1991). Granott\u2019s theory of how diverse individuals understand the complex movements of Lego/Logo \u201ccreatures\u201d was woven into a new fabric, which Resnick\u2014working with Lego/Logo robots\u2014called distributed constructionism (Resnick, 1991, 1994). Uri Wilensky, with Resnick, deepened the theoretical framework around the behavior of complex systems, introducing a \u201clevels\u201d framework (Resnick & Wilensky, 1998; Wilensky & Reisman, 2006; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999).\n\nTo model, describe, predict and explain emergent phenomena in complex systems, Resnick and Wilensky designed StarLogo; Wilensky has more recently designed the more widely used successor, NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) which also includes a module for conducting participatory simulations (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). Wilensky, a mathematician concerned with expanding mathematics education, connected it more to science education and to probability (Wilensky, 1993), is often cited for his asking a simple question to young people: How do geese \ufb02y in formation? The answers that young people give show how interesting yet dif\ufb01cult emergent phenomena are to describe.\n\nMathematics was an important frame for much of the research conducted in Project Headlight. Papert himself was a noted mathematician. In one study at the Hennigan School, Idit Harel worked with groups of children creating games in Logo for other children to use in learning about fractions (1991). The idea that children could be designers of their own learning  environments was developed further by Yasmin Kafai who introduced computer design to understand how girls and boys think when playing and designing games, a topic of great interest to video game designers (Kafai, 1993, 1996). Kafai spent more than a decade creating a range of video game environments for girls and boys to design environments for learning (and now works with more tactile digial textures). Kafai connected the world of playing and designing to the life of the classroom in a number of studies in the 1990s and early 2000s. Here current work at the University of Pennsylvania focuses on topics connected with the Learning Sciences, constructionism, games, virtual worlds, and gender.\n\nSeymour Papert\u2019s legacy continues to grow and morph as his \ufb01rst generation of students from the early years at the MIT Media Lab expand their research in various academic and industry homes: Uri Wilensky at Northwestern University, Idit Harel at her company, WorldWideWorkshop, Carol Strohecker at the University of North Carolina, Edith Ackermann at MIT, Yasmin Kafai at the University of Pennsylvania, Mitchel Resnick at MIT, Ricki Goldman at New York University, Nira Granott at the University of Texas, Dallas, Fred Martin at University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Susan Imholz at Pepperdine, Yasmin Kafai at University of Pennsylvania, and David Schaffer at University at Wisconsin, Madison. Sustained for over thirty years now, this community of researchers has studied a range of learning environments using games, tools, robots, and video data analysis systems using a Papertian constructionist perspective that continues to spread among new generations of scholars.\n\nConstructionism may have taken on a more social, ecological and distributed approach than Papert \ufb01rst proposed, but these changes are to be expected given the changes in technologies in this same period.\n\nDigital Media for Scaffolding\n\nThe computer asscaffold is yet another alternative to tool, environment, or partner. This version makes reference to Vygotsky\u2019s construct of the zone of proximal development (ZPD).\n[T]he distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86)The scaffold metaphor originally referred to the role of the teacher, embodying the characteristics of providing support, providing a supportive tool, extending the learner\u2019s range, allowing the learner to accomplish tasks not otherwise possible, and being selectively usable (Green\ufb01eld, 1984, p. 118). Vygotsky\u2019s construct has been picked up by designers of educational software, in particular the CSILE project at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).\n\nAt OISE, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter worked toward developing a collaborative knowledge-building environment and asked how learners (children) could be given relatively more control over the ZPD through directing the kinds of questions that drive educational inquiry (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). The CSILE environment provided a scaffolded conferencing and notetaking environment in which learners themselves could be in charge of the questioning and inquiry of collaborative work\u2014something more traditionally controlled by the teacher\u2014in such a way that kept the endeavor from degenerating into chaos.\n\nAnother example of technological scaffolding comes from George Landow\u2019s research into using hypertext and hypermedia\u2014nonlinear, reader-driven text and media\u2014in the study of English literature (Landow & Delany, 1993). In Landow\u2019s research, a student could gain more information about some aspect of Shakespeare, for example, by following any number of links presented in an electronic document. A major component of Landow\u2019s work was his belief in providing students with the context of the subject matter. The technological scaffolding provides a way of managing that context\u2014so that it is not so large, or complicated, or daunting that it prevents learners from exploring, but \ufb02exible and inviting enough to encourage exploration beyond the original text. The question facing future researchers of these non-linear and alternately structures technologies may be this: Can the computer environment create a place in which the context or the culture, as anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) would say, is felt, understood, and can be communicated to others? More controversially, perhaps, can these technologies be designed and guided by the learners themselves without losing the richness that direct engagement with experts and teachers can offer them?\n\nDigital Media for Cognitive Partnering\n\nSomewhere amid conceiving of computing technology as arti\ufb01cial mind and conceiving of it as communications medium is the notion of computer as partner. This somewhat more romanticized version of \u201ctechnology as tool\u201d puts more emphasis on the communicative and interactive aspects of computing. A computer is more than a tool like the pencil that one writes with because, in some sense, it writes back. And although this idea has surely existed since early AI and ITS research, it wasn\u2019t until an important article in the early 1990s (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991) that the idea of computers as \u201cpartners in cognition\u201d was truly elaborated.\n\nAs early as the 1970s, Gavriel Salomon had been exploring the use of media (television in particular) and its effect upon childhood cognition (Salomon, 1979). Well versed in Marshall McLuhan\u2019s (1964) adage, the medium is the message, later to become the medium is the massage, Salomon has built a bridge between those who propose an instrumentalist view of media (media effects theory) and those who understand media to be a cultural artifact in and of itself. Along these lines, in 1991, Salomon, David Perkins, and Tamar Globerson drew a very important distinction:\nEffects with technology obtained during partnership with it, and effects of it in terms of the transferable cognitive residue that this partnership leaves behind in the form of better mastery of \u201cskills and strategies.\u201d (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991, p. 2)Their article came at a time when the effects of computers on learners were being roundly criticized (Pea & Kurland, 1987; Sloan, 1985), and helped break new ground toward a more distributed view of knowledge and learning (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1996 [1989]; Pea, 1985 &1993). To conceive of the computer as a partner in cognition\u2014or learning, or work\u2014is to admit it into the cultural milieu, to foreground the idea that the machine, in some way has agency or at least in\ufb02uence in our thinking.\n\nIf we ascribe agency to the machine, we are going some way toward anthropomorphizing it, a topic Sherry Turkle has written about extensively (Turkle, 1984, 1995). Goldman-Segall writes of her partnership with digital research tools as \u201ca partnership of intimacy and immediacy\u201d (1998a, p. 33). MIT interface theorist Andrew Lippman de\ufb01ned interactivity as mutual activity and  interruptibility (Brand, 1987), and Alluquere Rosanne Stone goes further, referring to the partnership with machines as \u201ca prosthetic device\u201d for constructing desire (Stone, 1995). Computers are, as Alan Kay envisioned in the early 1970s, personal machines.\n\nThe notion of computers as cognitive partners is further exempli\ufb01ed in research conducted by anthropologist Lucy Suchman at Xerox. Suchman\u2019s Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human- Machine Communication explored the difference between rational, purposive plans, and circumstantial, negotiated, situated actions. Rather than actions being imperfect copies of rational plans, Suchman showed how \u201cplans\u201d are idealized representations of real-world actions. With this in mind, Suchman argued that, rather than working toward more and more elaborate computational models of purposive action, researchers give priority to the contextual situatedness of practice:\nA basic research goal for studies of situated action, therefore, is to explicate the relationship between structures of action and the resources and constraints afforded by physical and social circumstances. (Suchman, 1987, p. 179)Suchman\u2019s colleagues at Xerox PARC in the 1980s designed tools as structures within working contexts; innovative technologies such as collaborative design boards, real-time virtual meeting spaces, and video conferencing between co-workers were a few of the environments at PARC where people could scaffold their existing practices.\n\nMedia for Social Constructionism\n\nHistorically, constructivist learning theories were rooted in the epistemologies of social  on structivist philosopher John Dewey, social psychologist Lev Vygotsky, developmental and cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Knowledge of the world is seen to be constructed through experience; the role of education is to guide the learner through experiences that provide opportunities to construct knowledge about the world. In Piaget\u2019s version, this process is structured by the sequence of developmental stages. In Vygostsky\u2019s cultural-historical version, the process is mediated by the tools and contexts of the child\u2019s sociocultural environment. As a result of the in\ufb02uence of Vygotsky\u2019s work, researchers in a variety of institutions view the computer and new media technologies as environments, drawing on the notion that learning happens best for children when they are engaged in creating personally meaningful digital media artifacts and sharing them publicly. Learning and Epistemology Group, the Center for Children and Technology, Vanderbilt\u2019s Cognition and Technology Group, TERC, the Concord Consortium in Boston, Georgia Tech, and SRI are just a few of the exemplary research settings involved in the exploration of learning and teaching using technologies as learning environments during the 1990s. Several of these communities (SRI International, Stanford, Berkeley, and the Concord Consortium) formed an association called CILT, the Center for Innovation in Learning and Teaching, which became a hub for researchers from many institutions. More recently, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center called LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments), was established. It is hosted at the University of Washington in partnership with Stanford University and SRI International.\n\nThe range of methodological perspectives employed in these various research institutions, however, is as diverse as might be expected. Moreover, the discussion about what constitutes good research varied from community to community with some using mostly qualitative methods and others using quantitative measures and methods. Qualitative research methods, with their emphasis on case studies and in-depth analyses, best describe the conclusions of a study that is constructionist by design. Constructionists tend to be interested in digging around in the complexity of a small set of events while instructionists tend to focus on the organization of a larger set of variables. An instructionist tends to \ufb01rst look at a whole system and then break the whole into smaller units to be learned or processed; constructionists build up. They put together small units and combine micro-procedures into the elements\u2014or chunks\u2014of larger structures and wholes. This does not mean that constructionists do not have plans as they tinker or play with computational objects. Far from it; constructionists have plans which are in continual \ufb02ux as the parts of any whole program are built, assembled, and integrated (Suchman, 1987). Even the smallest change in a procedure can dramatically alter the outcome of a program. The designer/constructionist \u201ctweaks\u201d code at both top and bottom levels in the in\ufb01nite re\ufb01nement of an artifact.\n\nWhen individuals and groups create digital media artifacts, those artifacts then inhabit the learning environment, creating an ecology that we share with one another and with our media constructions. Technology can be seen as an expressive tool that allows learners to manipulate objects-to-think-with and through exploration and re\ufb02ection to come to more formal understandings of systems and relationships. Technology is thus not just an instrument we use within an environment, but is part of the social and ecological environment itself.\n\nDigital Media for Collaborative and Distance Learning\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant advancement of collaborative learning with computers is the development of the ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community, which hosts a bi-annual conference and a journal called the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. In a 1996 article, Timothy Koschmann suggested that the major educational technology paradigm of the late 1990s would be CSCL, a close relative of the emerging \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). Educational technology, Koschmann pointed out, is now concerned with collaborative activities, largely using networks and computer conferencing facilities. Whether CSCL constitutes a paradigm shift is a question that is yet to be answered, but Koschmann\u2019s identi\ufb01cation of the trend is well noted. Two oft-cited research papers by Margaret Riel (and colleagues) into this category: Margaret Riel, James Levin, and colleagues on \u201cteleprenticeship\u201d (Levin, Riel, Miyake, & Cohen, 1987) and \u201clearning circles\u201d (Riel, 1993, 1996). Learning circles connected many students at great distances\u2014classroom to classroom as much as student to student\u2014in large-scale collaborative learning.\n\nHiltz and Turoff\u2019s Network Nation (1978), although originally concerned mostly with business communications and management science, explored teaching and learning with network technologies, applying their insights to practical problems of teaching and learning online. In general, the more the course is oriented to teaching basic skills (such as deriving mathematical proofs), the more the lecture is needed in some form as an ef\ufb01cient means of delivering illustrations of skills. However, the more the course involves pragmatics, such as interpretations of case studies, the more valuable is the CMC [Computer Mediated Communication] mode of delivery. (Hiltz & Turoff, 1993 [1978], p. 471)\n\n(Looking a bit further back in time, one needs to re\ufb02ect for a moment on the earliest beginnings of this research. It is often credited to the work of Douglas Engelbart at SRI in the 1960s (Bootstrap Institute, 1994). Englebart\u2019s work centered on the oNLine System (NLS), a combination of hardware and software that facilitated the \ufb01rst networked collaborative computing, setting the stage for workgroup computing, document management systems, electronic mail, and the \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW).\n\nThe \ufb01rst computer conference management information system, EMISARI, was created by Murray Turoff while working in the U.S. Of\ufb01ce of Emergency Preparedness in the late 1960s and was used for monitoring disruptions and managing crises. Turoff continued developing networked, collaborative computing at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in the 1970s working with Starr Roxanne Hiltz. Turoff and Hiltz founded the \ufb01eld of computer-mediated communication (CMC) with their landmark book, The Network Nation (1993 [1978]). The book describes a new world of computer conferencing and communications, and is to this day impressive in its comprehensive insightfulness. Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s work inspired a generation of computer mediated communication researchers, notably including technology theorist Andrew Feenberg (1987) at San Diego State University, and Virtual-U founder Linda Harasim (1990, 1993) at Simon Fraser University.\n\nParallel to the early development of CMC, research in CAI (Computer Assisted Learning) began to take seriously the possibilities of connecting students over networks. As mentioned earlier, the PLATO system at the University of Illinois was probably the \ufb01rst large-scale distributed CAI\nsystem. PLATO was a large time-sharing system, designed (and indeed economically required) to support thousands of users connecting from networked terminals. In the 1970s, PLATO began to offer peer-to-peer conferencing features, making it one of the \ufb01rst online educational\ncommunities (Woolley, 1994).\n\nDistance education researchers were interested in CMC, too, as an adjunct to or replacement for more traditional modes of communication, such as audio teleconferencing and the postal service. The British Open University was an early testbed of online conferencing. A. W. Bates (1988), and Alexander Romiszowski and Johan de Haas (1989) were looking into the opportunities presented by Q5 computer conferencing and the challenges of conducting groups in these text-only environments. Bates has written extensively about the management and planning of technology-based distance education, drawing on two decades of experience building \u201copen learning\u201d systems in the United Kingdom and Canada (Bates, 1995).\n\nIn the 1990s, Hiltz wrote extensively about Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) and education. Her 1994 book, The Virtual Classroom, elaborates a methodology for conducting education in computer-mediated environments emphasizing the importance of assignments using group collaboration to improve motivation. Hiltz hoped that students would share their assignments with the community rather than being \u201cmailed\u201d to the instructor. Hiltz was surely on a pioneering player in online learning during the late 1980s and early 1990s inspiring researchers around the world to realize the promise of \u201canyplace, anytime\u201d learning (Harasim, 1993) and study the dynamics of teachers and learners in online asynchronous conferencing systems.\n\nRoxanne Hiltz and Ricki Goldman (2005), in their collaboration on an edited book called Learning Together Online: Research on Asynchronous Learning Networks discuss the past, present, and future educational research on Asynchronous Networked Learning (ALN) community. In their \ufb01nal chapter the researchers remind us that being part of a social network is about growing a culture of learners. Using the example of jazz players, they note that,\n[W]hile some artists say they \ufb01nd that the required social networking keeps them away from their real passion, creating their works, many maintain that the continual push and pull with...the social world of their artistry enables them to see things with a greater perspective when returning to their work. What we are describing is a culture where the learners drive to create is appreciated, the artifacts that are created have a public sphere to be shown in, and the system is supported because it offers important values to the healthfulness of society. In short, cultures are created supporting members\u2019 activities and these cultures then produce sub-cultures while affecting changes to the overall culture. (Goldman & Hiltz, 2005.)In the early 1990s, students, teachers, and researchers around the world began to engage in networked collaborative projects. At the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at Northwestern University, the Collaborative Visualization (Co-Vis) project involved groups of young people in different schools conducting experiments and gathering scienti\ufb01c data on weather patterns (Edelson, Pea, & Gomez, 1996). Research at the Multimedia Ethnographic Research Lab (MERLin) at the University of British Columbia focused on how young people, teachers, and researchers conducted ethnographic investigations on a complex environmental crisis at Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island (Goldman-Segall, 1994), with the aim of communicating with other young people in diverse locations. The Global Forest project was centered on a CDROM database of video but used the World Wide Web to allow participants from around the world to share diverse points of viewing and interpretation of the video data. At the TERC research center, large-scale collaborative projects were designed in conjunction with the National Geographic Society Kids Network (Feldman, Konold, & Q6 Coulter, 2000; Tinker, 1996).\n\nThe TERC project was concerned with \u201cnetwork science\u201d and as with Riel\u2019s learning circles, multiple classrooms collaborated together, in this case gathering environmental science data and sharing in its analysis. For example, in the NGS Kids Network Acid Rain unit, students collect data about acid rain in their own communities, submit these data to the central database, and retrieve the full set of data collected by hundreds of schools. When examined by students, the full set of data may reveal patterns of acidity in rainfall that no individual class is able discover by itself based on its own data. Over time, the grid of student measurements would have the potential to be much more \ufb01nely grained than anything available to scientists, and this would become a potential resource for scientists to use. (Feldman, Konold, & Coulter, 2000, p. 7) One of the most interesting developments in CMC since the advent of the Internet is immersive virtual reality environments\u2014particularly MUDs and MOOs\u2014within which learners can meet, interact, and collaboratively work on research or constructed artifacts (Bruckman,\n1998; Dede, 1994; Haynes & Holmevik, 1998).\n\nVirtual environments, along with the popular but less interesting \u201cchat\u201d systems on the Internet, add synchronous communications to the synchronous modes so extensively researched and written about since Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s early work. One could position these immersive, virtual environments as perspectivity technologies as they create spaces for participants to create and share their worlds. There were many who predicted the cultural, social, economic, and educational impact of the Internet as a site for collaboration. Indeed, from the standpoint of the 21st century, most nonmaterial collaborations and works created collaboratively, in some way, involve the Internet. The result is that all education computing is a communications system, involving distributed systems, peerto-peer communication, telementoring, or some similar construct\u2014quite as Roxanne Star Hiltz and Murray Turoff predicted in the 1970s. Along with \u201csocial media\u201d as a common activity, perspectivity technologies (technologies which enable, encourage, and expand users\u2019 points of viewing) can be designed to create more democratic, interactive, convivial, and contextual communication that involve stakeholders\u2019 decisions (Goldman-Segall, 2000;Goldman & Dong, 2009). Goldman and Dong also discus the POV-T in relation to multimedia representations for teaching, learning, and research in socially networked\nlearning environments.\n\nThe Internet has clearly opened up enormous possibilities for shared learning. The emergence of broad standards for Internet software has lent a stability and relative simplicity to learning software. Moreover, the current widespread availability and use of Internet technologies could be said to mark the end of CMC as a research \ufb01eld unto itself, as it practically merges CMC with all manner of other conceptualizations of new media technological devices: CAI, intelligent tutoring systems, simulations, robotics, smart boards, wireless communications, wearable technologies, pervasive technologies, and even smart appliances.\n\nDigital Media as Perspectivity-Sharing\n\nSocial media and interactive video and computer games are engaging because they involve the perspectives and opinions of users who contribute to their networked communities. Using Perspectivity Technologies learners/participants become collaborators, curators, creators, and builders, layering their viewpoints and becoming connected with each other in ways that enable commensurability. Commensurabilty is a state where understanding of each other\u2019s cultures is reached, if only temporarily. One could trace the \ufb01rst glimmer of perspectivity technologies to Xerox\u2019 PARC in the 1970s. There, Alan Kay was inventing what we now recognize as the \u201cpersonal computer,\u201d a small, customizable device with substantial\ncomputing power, mass storage, and the ability to handle multiple media formats. Kay\u2019s advances, while simply pedestrian today, were at the time revolutionary. Kay\u2019s vision of small, self-contained personal computers was without precedent, as was his vision of how they would be used: as personalized media construction toolkits that would usher in a new kind of literacy. With this literacy would start the discourse between technology as scienti\ufb01c tool and technology as personal expression. The particular aim of [Xerox\u2019 Learning Research Group] was to \ufb01nd the equivalent of writing\u2014that is, learning and thinking by doing in a medium\u2014our new \u201cpocket universe.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)\n\nAt Bank Street College in the 1980s, a video and videodisc project called \u201cThe Voyage of the Mimi\u201d immersed learners in scienti\ufb01c exploration of whales and Mayan cultures. Learners identi\ufb01ed strongly with the student characters in the video stories. Similarly, the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) were working on video-based units in an attempt to involve students in scienti\ufb01c inquiry (Martin, 1987). \u201cThe Adventures of Jasper Woodbury\u201d was a series of videodisc-based adventures, which provided students with engaging content and contexts for solving mysteries and mathematical problems (Vanderbilt Learning Technology Center website). While both of these environments were outstanding exemplars of students using various media forms to get to know the people and the culture within the story structures, the lasting contribution is not only one of enhanced mathematical or social studies understanding, but rather a connection to people who are engaged in real-life inquiry.\n\nWith an AI orientation, computer scientist, inventor, and educator Elliot Soloway at the University of Michigan built tools to enable learners to create personal hypermedia documents, reminiscent of Kay\u2019s personalized media construction toolkits. Soloway and his colleagues continue to\nstudy project-based science through the design of sophisticated technologies developed for distributed knowledge construction since their landmark article called \u201cThe casebook of project practices: An example of an interactive multimedia system for professional development\u201d (Krajcik, Soloway, Blumenfeld, Marx, Ladewski, Bos & Hayes, 1996). Complementary pioneering work started by Marcia Linn at Berkeley analyzed the cognition of students who wrote programs in the computer language LISP, and Andrea diSessa, also at Berkeley, who studied students learning physics using his program called Boxer.\n\nFor diSessa, physics deals with,\n[A] rather large number of fragments rather than one or even any small number of integrated structures one might call \u201ctheories.\u201d Many of these fragments can be understood as simple abstractions from common experiences that are taken as relatively primitive in the sense that they generally need no explanation; they simply happen. (diSessa,1988, p. 52)Andrea diSessa\u2019s theory of physics resonates strongly with the notion of bricolage, a term \ufb01rst used by the French structural anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss (1968) to describe a person who builds from pieces and does not have a speci\ufb01c plan at the onset of the project. Levi-Strauss was often used as a point of departure for cognitive scientists interested in the analysis of fragments rather than in building broad generalizations from top-down rationalist structures. By the 1990s, French social theory has indeed in\ufb01ltrated the cognitive paradigm, legitimizing cultural analysis.\n\nStrongly in\ufb02uenced by the notion of bricolage, Goldman-Segall\u2019s (now Goldman) early digital ethnographies of children\u2019s thinking (1990, 1991, 1998) and more recent collaborative studies with her colleagues about girls\u2019 prototyping video games to promote mathematics learning in low socio-economic communities are rich examples of perspectivity theory. In these works, Goldman establishes unique partnerships among viewer, author, and media texts; a set of partnerships that revolves around, and is revolved around, the constant recognition of cultural connections as core factors in using new-media technologies.\n\nSituating her digital ethnographic work in Clifford Geertz\u2019s notion of the thick description, Goldman explores the tenuous, and often permeable, layered relations between creator, user, and media artifact through an online environment for video analysis (1989, 1998). A video segment, for example, is the representation of a moment in the making of cultures. A video object is a cultural object and also a \u201cpersonal subject-to think-with,\u201d something to turn around and reshape together. And, just as we change it through our manipulation, so it changes both our cultural possibilities and us. A fuller description of this theory can be found in the volume, Video Research in the Learning Sciences (Goldman, Pea, Barron & Derry, 2007), published with 67 learning science video researchers.\n\nAnother example of a perspectivity technology is described in the doctoral work of Maggie Beers who explored preservice teachers\u2019 learning modern languages to build and critique digital artifacts connecting self and other (Beers, 2001; Beers & Goldman-Segall, 2001). Beers has shown how groups of preservice teachers create video artifacts as representations of their various cultures in order to share and understand each others\u2019 perspectives as an integral part of learning a foreign language. The self becomes a strong reference point for understanding others while engaged in many contexts with media tools and artifacts.\n\nAnother exemplary application of perspectivity theory is demonstrated by Gerry Stahl. Stahl has been working on the idea of perspective and technology at the University of Colorado for more than a decade. His WebGuide forms the technical foundation into an investigation of the role of artifacts in collaborative knowledge building for deepening perspective. Drawing on Vygotsky\u2019s theories of cultural mediation, Stahl\u2019s work develops models of collaborative knowledge building, and the role of shared cultural artifacts\u2014and particularly digital media artifacts\u2014in that process (Stahl, 1999).\n\nIn sum, perspectivity technologies enhance, motivate, and provide new opportunities for learning, teaching, and research because they address how the personal point of view connects with evolving discourse communities. Perspectivity thinking tools enable knowledge-based cultures to grow, creating both real and virtual communities within the learning environment to share information, to alter the self/other relationship, and to open the door to a deeper, richer partnership with our technologies and one another. Just as a language changes as speakers alter the original form, so does the nature of discourse-communities change as cultures spread and variations of meanings are coconstructed.\n\nDigital Media for Playing and Learning With Games\n\nVideo and computer games are popular and motivating environments, and there have been calls to use them as a way to get students more engaged in education and to use them as effective environments for learning (e.g., Prensky, 2007). James Gee (2007) makes the case that video games have many of the characteristics that learning science researchers often recommend for the design of effective learning environments. When well-designed digital games represent conceptual play spaces in which learners/players can work in teams or by themselves to creatively solve problems, develop and test hypotheses, and investigate the game system and its rules (Barab, Sadler, Heiselt, Hickey, & Zuiker, 2007; Shaffer, 2006), learners can play at their own pace, set their own goals, and regulate their own exploration behaviors in an environment that also engages them on behavioral, cognitive, and emotional levels (Domagk, Schwartz, & Plass, 2010). However, the results from studies of how people learn content from and with video games are mixed. This suggests that careful research is needed to show under what conditions games are effective for learning.\n\nWhat we do know at this time is that experimental research has shown strong improvements of basic perceptual and cognitive processes as a result of playing certain video games. Several studies have shown that action games, that is, video games that require players to divide their attention over multiple targets (e.g., Halo), result in signi\ufb01cant increases in players\u2019 contrast sensitivity, as well as in the players\u2019 ability to do divided attention tasks, which is a basic attention cognitive skill (Green & Bavelier, 2003; Green\ufb01eld, deWinstanley, Kilpatrick, & Kaye, 1994). Play of video games using visual and spatial skills (e.g., Tetris) also increases those basic cognitive processes (Subrahmanyam & Green\ufb01eld, 1994); and, play of action video games (e.g., Unreal Tournament) results in increased spatial resolution and visual acuity (Green & Bavelier, 2007).\n\nTo understand the bene\ufb01t of using video games in a learning context, one needs to examine their potential future function in the learning process. Heuristics of existing games suggest four such functions: (1) prepare for future learning, (2) teach new knowledge or skills, (3) automate existing knowledge or skills, and (4) acquire 21st-century skills (Plass, Perlin, & Isbister, 2010). Preparation for future learning. Games to prepare for future learning do not aim to teach speci\ufb01c knowledge or skills, but to provide learners with a shared experience based on which content can be taught. Game genres typically used for such games therefore include adventure\ngames, open-ended simulation games, and role-playing games where students have an opportunity to take on different perspectives through role playing. Research by Hammer and Black (2009) suggests that the best use of video games in content (and perhaps other) learning might be in providing experience with the subject matter that will lead to better future learning of related material from a more formal learning setting.\n\nIn one study, Hammer and Black looked at expert players of the Civilization history simulation game and found that these expert players did not know any more about the historical content contained in the game than expert players of another unrelated game (Sim City) did. So far, this is consistent with the comparison research on content learning with video games. However, this study also examined how much the expert Civilization players would learn from reading a college textbook chapter on related historical content, and found that the Civilization players learned much more from reading the chapter than the expert players of the Sim City comparison game. Thus, having the experience of grappling with historical issues in the game may have provided the players with a set of experiences, as John Dewey (1938) said, that better prepared them for future learning from a more formal learning approach (Bransford & Schwartz, 2001).\n\nA related approach is the Teachable Agents Project at Vanderbilt. Using the Teachable Agents system, students learn by creating a concept map for a topic (e.g., river ecology) that then becomes what their online agent (avatar) knows about the topic. The system then puts questions to the agent and the students can see how well they know the topic by how well the agent does (and revise their and their agents\u2019 knowledge by changing the concept map and trying again). There is even a version where students\u2019 agents can \u201cplay\u201d against each other in a simulated TV quiz show, so that the students can see which concept maps work the best. Experimental research studies showed that students learning with Teachable Agents learned better (especially causal chains) than alternative approaches like standard classroom instruction and using concept maps. Teach new knowledge and skills. A strong case can be made that most if not all games teach the learner new knowledge or skills (Gee, 2007). However, the effectiveness or ef\ufb01cacy of games for learning at a large scale has not yet been suf\ufb01ciently investigated. Disagreement among researchers exists whether the very features that make games motivating and engaging\u2014the use of narratives to provide context and relevance, the design of emotional experiences, opportunities for discovery and exploration, and the use of compelling visual representations\u2014 facilitate learning or whether they introduce extraneous cognitive processing demands on working memory that suppress learning (Kirschner, Sweller, &Clark, 2006).\n\nStudies that have compared learning academic content (as opposed to attention and visual-spatial cognitive skills) have shown negative results for learning from video games. For example, Egenfeldt-Nielsen (2005) compared learning about European history from playing a history simulation game to learning the same content in a classroom, and found that students learned more from the classroom. Similarly, Mayer, MacNamara, and Adams (2011) found that students learned more about ecology by merely going through PowerPoint slides than they did from playing an ecology simulation game. On the other hand, qualitative and observational studies have showed student learning from video games (Barab, Zuiker, Warren, Hickey, Ingram-Goble, Kwon, & Herring., 2007; Squire, 2004). These results suggest that more sophisticated research methods have to be employed that use both qualitative and quantitative data in an interwoven way, such as through the adoption of POV-T (1998), to investigate the effectiveness of games for the acquisition of new knowledge and skills.\n\nThe game-plus approach is de\ufb01ned entails game learning in conjunction with other activities. Consistent with this games-plus approach, Steinkuehler and Duncan\u2019s (2009) found that players of Massively Multiplayer Online Games like World of Warcraft show informal scienti\ufb01c reasoning skills in online discussion forums that are supplements to the games and where players share their experiences. Another study consistent with this approach is Ahn (2007) and Black (2011) who looked at college undergraduates learning from an entrepreneurship simulation game (from Harvard Business School) as part of an entrepreneurship college course. The study found that students learned much more from playing the game (multiple times) when they also re\ufb02ected on and articulated their business and game-playing strategies, and related them to background readings in textbooks for the course (this is like the college textbook reading in the Hammer and Black study). They did not learn nearly as much from the game play if they did not re\ufb02ect on how it relates to this background reading.\n\nAll of the video game studies covered so far involve students learning from playing video games. However, a different, but effective, approach to video games and learning is to have students learn by creating video games themselves. Early studies by Harel (1991) and Kafai (1995) showed that students learned more about both fractions and computer programming (the Logo programming language designed for kids) if they created educational software or computer games to teach other students about fractions than they did if they learned about fractions and computer programming separately. Building on this work, Harel (now Harel Caperton) has established an online social networking environment called World Wide Workshop for kids to learn by creating online games (www.worldwideworkshop.org/). In related more recent work, Fadjo and Black (2011) have found that having students act out what they want their video game avatars to do, then programming a simple video game in which the avatars perform these actions (see discussion of embodied cognition in this chapter), is a more effective way for students to learn the programming and math skills than having them learn in alternative ways.\n\nIn a games and gender study involving the game Rapunsel, designed to teach middle school girls how to program by using a Java-like language to customize the avatars in the game, the strongest impact of the game was not on cognitive learning outcomes. After using the game for only four sessions, students\u2019 general self-ef\ufb01cacy, programming-related self-ef\ufb01cacy, and self-esteem increased signi\ufb01cantly, suggesting that games are able to impact learners\u2019 identity formation in a way that positively changes their attitudes toward their ability to perform science-related tasks (Plass, Goldman, Flanagan, & Perlin, 2009).\n\nAutomate existing knowledge or skills. The majority of games used for learning do not aim to teach signi\ufb01can't new knowledge or skills, but are designed to help the learner automate existing skills, such as basic arithmetic, algebra, Newtonian mechanics, history, or others. Game genres used for such games therefore typically include puzzle games, platformers, labyrinth games, and race games, often implemented as relatively short mini games. Research has shown that such games provide a venue for players to use their knowledge of biological and physical science topics, such as the water cycle (Lim, Nonis, & Hedberg, 2006) and principles of electromagnetism (Squire, Barnett, Grant, & Higginbotham, 2004), as well as math topics, such as measurement, whole numbers, equations, and graphing (Ke & Grabowski, 2007).\n\nChildren as young as six years of age have been found to develop stronger numeracy skills after playing computer games that provide practice in number sense and counting (Rasanen, Salminen, Wilson, Aunio, & Dehaene, 2009). At the high school level, videogames have been found to be effective tools for the reinforcement of algebra skills in an immersive three dimensional environment (Kebritchi, Hirumi, & Bai, 2010) as well as computer science concepts integrated into a labyrinth game (Papastergiou, 2009).\n\nAcquire 21st-century skills. Many games do not aim to teach academic knowledge or skills, or to automate existing knowledge or skills, but rather focus on the development of skills that has collectively have come to be known as 21st-century Skills, although most of them have been recognized for many decades, if not centuries, to be important predictors of success in life. These skills include creative problem solving, communication skills, team collaboration, emotional intelligence, and many others. Game genres typically used for such games include adventure games and role-playing games with large numbers of players, which are known as MMOs (Massive Multiplayer Games). Studies have shown that such games facilitate the acquisition of systems based reasoning and social knowledge construction (Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2009), collaborative problem solving (Squire, 2004), and civic thinking (Bagley & Shaffer, 2009).\n\nAll of the studies cited above assume that the games used in the investigations were well designed to facilitate learning. However, as Plass, Homer, and Hayward (2009) have shown, the design of games for learning is a highly complex and dif\ufb01cult process for which very little theory based, empirically validated guidance for designers exist. Another line of research has therefore been concerned with the identi\ufb01cation of design patterns for effective games for learning. This research, which is in part based on research of the design of effective simulations, has shown that icons are effective visual representations of key information, especially for younger learners and learners with low prior knowledge in the subject matter (Homer & Plass, 2010; Plass, Homer, Milne, Jordan, Kalyuga, Kim, & Lee, 2009;).\n\nOther research has investigated the mode of play for games teaching math skills, comparing collaborative play and competitive play to a single player version of a game. Results indicate that players enjoy playing with others more (in collaborative or competitive mode) and solve more problems in the competitive mode, but that they acquire a higher math \ufb02uency, an expression of the acquired math skills, when playing by themselves. A \ufb01nal study investigated the use of different learning mechanics in a game to teach middle school geometry. Players were asked to solve missing angles in order to clear the path for their avatar to free a peer from imprisonment. One mechanic was designed to require the player to compute the correct value of the missing angle and enter this number as response, whereas another mechanic asked\nlearners to identify which rule (e.g., complementary angles rule, supplementary angles rule, opposite angles rule, or the like) they would apply to solve the problem. Results suggest that computing the correct angles value was more situationally interesting than identifying the correct rule.\n\nHowever, participants in the rule condition were found to perform better in the game than those in the number condition. Results further suggest that in the number condition, but not the rule condition, playing more levels in the game diminishes the gain from pretest to posttest (Plass, Homer, Hayward et al., 2011). Games are an emerging medium for learning that requires research concerning both its effectiveness for learning and related design patterns. This research topic would bene\ufb01t from mixed methods, or what Goldman and colleagues call Quisitive Research (Goldman, Crosby, Swan & Shea, 2005; Goldman-Segall, 1996, Goldman,2007). In quisitive research perspectives from a fuller range of stakeholders use both quantitative and qualitative research methods along with emerging digital text and video tools for data analysis in order to investigate this topic further.\n\nEmotion, Empathy, Affective Computing, and Pespective-Taking\n\nThe history of emotional and social learning can be said to date back to the works by John Dewey\u2019s Experience in Education. It became a \u201cmantra\u201d of the Civil Rights Movement as well as the progressive, cooperative, and the whole child movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, the cluster of terms being used includes: social and emotional, empathetic learning, affective computing, and perpective-taking learning. According to Zins and Elias (2006):\n[S]ocial and emotional learning (SEL) is the capacity to recognize and manage emotions, solve problems effectively, and establish positive relationships with others...SEL is the process of acquiring and effectively applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to recognize and manage emotions; developing caring and concern for others; making responsible decisions; establishing positive relationships; and handling challenging situations capably. (Zin & Elias, 2006, p. 1)A series of research projects under computer scientist, Rosalind Picard, are aimed at investigating the emotional and environmental aspects of digital technologies. This work on \u201caffective computing\u201d (Picard, 1997, 2010) researches areas that include computer recognition of human affect, computer synthesis of affect, wearable computers, and affective interaction with computers. (See www.media.mit.edu/affect/). Needless to add, emotional learning has been of interest in the use of persuasive technologies in political and product advertising campaigns, as Ian Bogost (2007) points out. In educational research on gaming, interest in the emotional aspect of designing games for social good and as well as on developing historical empathy are currently at the forefront of renewed interest in emotions and learning.\n\nBelman and Flanagan (2010) argue that \u201cgames are particularly well-suited to supporting educational or activist programs in which the fostering of empathy is a key method or goal.\u201d As we discussed in the previous section, there is growing interest in harnessing the power of games for education. Belman and Flanagan ask: Why not design games to advance empathy and social activism? Some software interaction designers and academics have proposed that engaging players on the emotional level is a key element of their use. Sasha Barab and his colQ7 leagues (2005) designed Quest Atlantis, for example, which promotes children\u2019s educational and activist pursuits by engaging them with a fantasy that resonates at an emotional meta-level of cognition. Belman and Flanagan suggest that activist designers would \ufb01nd it useful to encourage empathetic play, a mode of play in which players intentionally try to infer the thoughts and feelings of people or groups represented in the game, and/or they prepare themselves for an emotional response, for example by looking for similarities between themselves and characters in the game. (Belman & Flanagan, 2010, p. 5-15)\n\nTaking a curricular and epistemological perspective, James Diamond, asks: How does game play in a history video game in\ufb02uence students\u2019 achievement of historical empathy? Although historical empathy is a construct that connotes \u201cperspective taking-in-historical-context\u201d, Diamond includes theory of mind in the construct. Using the video game, Mission US, he describes not only if players\u2019 abilities to achieve historical empathy change in the course of game play, but how students play and if their playing can inform future designs of games constructed to help students contextualize other people\u2019s thinking and behaviors (Diamond, 2012). Ashby and Lee (Ashby & Lee, 1987; Lee & Ashby, 2001)\u2014who are often cited as the pioneers of work on empathy in history education\u2014would be pleased to read this emerging work by Diamond.\n\nEmotional learning, including empthy development, is a major thematic for the future of educational research with digital media environments. Moreover, emotional learning along with social learning using social media, and embodied learning using interactive Wii and Kinectlike environments constitute the convergence of, not only new digital media technologies, but also a new paradigm of learning that depends upon the willingness of learners to share viewpoints and knowledge with each other. As Picard (2010), in an article titled \u201cEmotion Research by the People, for the People\u201d asks, how do we remind ourselves as researchers that the public as well must become part of the scholarly discourse, and that together we explore this new domain called emotional learning and perspective-taking.\nToday when a child teaches a distinguished scientist to upload video on the Internet, when non- researchers can participate in scienti\ufb01c labeling from home, and when gathering autonomic nervous system data 24/7 is as easy as slipping on a sweatband, emotion research is ready for a major leap forward. Ordinary people can gather data, upload it, compare their patterns, share what they learn, and if they wish, share it with scientists for emotion research. Research can be done by the people, for the people. Of course scientists still have to be involved: there is no substitute for deep scholarly study across experiments and for the rigorous development and test of new hypotheses and theories. At the same time, there is no longer any excuse for leaving people out of \ufb01ndings. Emotion research can bene\ufb01t all its participants, scientists and laypeople, instead of becoming academic in the modern de\ufb01nition. (Picard, 2010, italics added)Digital Media for Embodied Cognition/Learning\n\nSome of the current criticisms of traditional formal learning suggest that: learning can be fragile and lacking in depth; learning does not become a part of the way the student thinks about and interacts with the everyday world; and students too often forget what they have learned after the end of the learning events if it does not get applied to relevant situations outside the learning setting. In the 2010s, as new technological environments such as Wiis and Kinect allow for a more physical interaction, this technology along with an embodied cognition approach may provide a new approach on what it means to learn.\n\nAlong with the increased interest in emotions, the nervous system, neurobiology, as well as tools for leaving traces of our activities and emotional responses, cognitive science has also taken on this term to use Gibbs\u2019 (2006) statement that \u201cconceptual systems and thought processes are shaped by body-based interactions and experiences in the world\u201d (Kwah and Goldman., 2011). In this same paper, they add that emotional experiences in\ufb02uence cognition and must play a role in engagement in learning. As Gibbs so aptly wrote: \u201cThe brain is certainly part of an integrated dynamic system devoted to the momentby-moment embodied dynamic of everyday life\u201d (p. 9). He goes on to claim that \u201cthe regularities in people\u2019s kinesthetic-tactile experience not only constitutes the core of their self-conceptions as persons, but form the foundation for higher-order cognition (p. 15). We emphasize that an embodied approach can provide guidance for the design of new kinds of learning environments that can make knowledge more accessible, useable, and bene\ufb01cial for society, in accordance with the three tenets of Ivan Illich\u2019 de\ufb01nition of convivial tools (1973). For the purpose of this paper on the advances of digital media and how they affect learning, it mean that embodied digital media tools and environments can provide an alternative to the scenario of designing learning for the\nsolitary person sitting in front of a monitor.\n\nOne increasingly prominent approach to cognition is called embodied or perceptually grounded learning approach.This approach proposes that a full understanding of something involves being able to create a mental perceptual simulation of it when retrieving the information or reasoning about it (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg, 1997). Both behavior and neuroimaging results have shown that many psychological phenomena that were thought to be purely symbolic show perceptual effects. For example, property veri\ufb01cation (e.g., retrieving the fact that a horse has a mane) was thought to involve a search from a concept node (horse) to a property node (mane) in a symbolic propositional network and thus the time to answer and errors was determined by how many network links needed to be searched and how many other distracting links were present. However, embodied cognition research shows that perceptual variables like size (e.g., more important properties are retrieved faster) affect veri\ufb01cation times and errors.\n\nAlso, neuroimaging results (e.g., fMRI) show that perceptual areas of the brain (involving shape, color, size, sound, and touch) also become active during this task, not just the symbolic areas. Thus, if one is familiar with horses and manes then doing even this simple property veri\ufb01cation\ninvolves a perceptual simulation. Glenberg, Gutierrez, Levin, Japuntich, and Kaschak (2004) discuss teaching reading comprehension by using a grounded cognition approach. These studies found that using toy farmers, workers, animals and objects increased their understanding and memory of the story they read. Further, if the students also imagined these actions for another related story after acting it out with the toys, they seemed to acquire the skill of forming the imaginary world of the story (Black, 2007) when reading other stories, and this increased their understanding and memory of these stories. Thus, this grounded cognition approach increased the students reading comprehension. These studies also seem to indicate that there are three steps involved in a grounded cognition approach to learning something: have an embodied experience; learn to imagine that embodied experience, and imagine the experience when learning from symbolic materials. Interestingly, it has also been shown that moving objects corresponding to story characters on a computer screen works just as well as moving toy objects in the physical environment (Glenberg, Goldberg, & Zhu, 2009).\n\nAn example of using an embodied cognition approach to designing learning environments and the learning advantages of doing so is provided by the graphic computer simulations with movement and animation that Han and Black (in press) used in perceptually enhancing the  learning experience. Chan and Black (2006) found that graphic computer simulations involving movement and animation were a good way to learn functional relations between system entities. Han and Black (in press) have enhanced the movement part of these interactive graphic simulations by adding haptic force feedback to the movement using graphic and sound simulations. Here the student moves the gears shown in the screen by moving a joy stick, and\nthen bar graphics on the screen show the input and output force levels for the two gears.\n\nAllowing the student to directly manipulate the gears enhances the students\u2019 learning, and enriching the movement experience by adding force feedback increases the students\u2019 performance even more. Thus the richer the perceptual experience, and therefore the mental perceptual simulation acquired, the better the student learning and understanding. Q9 Black, Segal, Vitale, & Fadjo (in press) reported on a number of embodied cognition technology learning environment projects and concluded that the richer the perceptual environment using multiple sensory modalities (e.g., using visuals, voiceovers, and movement) during initial learning the better the student learning. Secondly, they found that utilizing movements (e.g., gestures) that are conceptually congruent with the knowledge being learned increases student performance, learning, understanding, and motivation. A third \ufb01nding was that students who directly experience a phenomenon through activities like acting it out by moving their own bodies, learn about the topic in a more general way, which also increases learning, understanding, and motivation as does fourth, embodying their understanding in surrogates and then observing the surrogate behavior through activities like programming video-game-like virtual environments with avatar surrogates (with the Scratch programming environment) and\nprogramming robot surrogates like the LEGO NXT. Other recent technological developments, such as the Wii, offer mathematics-education researchers new ways of investigating deep cognitive and epistemological questions pertaining to the nature of knowing, learning, and teaching.\n\nFor example, in Gerofsky\u2019s study of secondary school students\u2019 learning about the features of graphs, such as roots, extrema, symmetries, asymptotes, re\ufb02ections over certain lines, domain and range, she found that embodied work appears to contribute to secondary school students\u2019 mathematical engagement and understanding (Gerofsky, 2011). She notes that:\nAn integrated pedagogy that moves back and forth among explicit teaching of new concepts, embodied exploration of the \u201cfeel\u201d and \u201csound\u201d of mathematical graphs, and sessions of mathematical inquiry and problem solving would appear to be an ideal kind of balanced program to promote mathematical understanding. Another increasingly prominent approach to embodied cognition has been proposed by Dror Abrahamson, director of Embodied Design Research Lab at University of California, Berkeley.\nThe EDRL research group uses design-based research and video analysis to study embodied mathematics learning, along with a growing group of researchers in a variety of research universities and labs (Antle, Corness, & Droumeva, 2009; Cress, Fischer, Moeller, Sauter, & Nuerk, 2010; Dam, 2011; Goldman et al., 2011; Howison, Trninic, Reinholz, & Abrahamson, 2011; Leong & Horn, 2011; Kwah & Goldman, 2011; Nemirovsky, Tierney, & Wright, 1998). Abrahamson\u2019s research group creates useful empirical settings to pursue the (somewhat controversial) grounded-cognition conjecture that mathematical reasoning is not encoded and processed in the mind in the form of amodal symbols, but rather is enacted and evoked as embodied, dynamical, multimodal schemes. This conjecture can be traced back to the work of phenomenology philosophers (Heidegger, 1962; MerleauPonty, 1958/2005), yet it is converging with perspectives and empirical \ufb01ndings from the cognitive and learning sciences (Barsalou, 2010; Bruner, Oliver, & Green\ufb01eld, 1966; Dourish, 2001; Goldin, 1987; Hommel, Musseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001; Nu\u00b4nez, Edwards, & Matos, 1999; Piaget & Inhelder, 1969; Skemp, 1983).\n\nIn one type of embodied-interaction design being investigated by Abrahamson and collaborators (Abrahamson, Trninic, Gutierrez, Huth, & Lee, 2011; Petrick & Martin, 2011), students interact with the Mathematical Imagery Trainer for Proportion (hence, \u201cMIT-P\u201d). The MIT-P is an embodied-interaction system designed to foster the development of perceptuomotor schemas grounding notions of proportion. Participants use both hands to remote-control a pair of virtual objects on a computer display monitor, one object per each hand, in attempts to \u201cmake the screen green.\u201d The screen will be green only if the hands rise proportionately, in accordance with an unknown ratio set on the instructor\u2019s console. Once students determine qualitative interaction principles, such as that \u201cthe higher you go, you need a bigger distance between the hands,\u201d mathematical instruments are interpolated onto the screen, such as a Cartesian grid and numerals. Students develop the cognitive foundations of proportions via objectifying and articulating their amathematical solution strategies using the available semiotic resources (Bamberger & diSessa, 2003; Bartolini Bussi & Mariotti, 2008; Radford, 2003).\n\nAs such, Abrahamson\u2019s MIT tasks are de\ufb01ned in terms of a speci\ufb01ed goal state of an interactive system, which the student is to effect, that is, a target phenomenal invariance that the student is to generate. As a learning activity, this task is dramatically different from traditional schoolwork,\nbecause the solution method is unknown to the child. Moreover, this task is different from what mathematicians do, because there is no theorem to prove. Rather, this task is closest to forms of inquiry that scientists engage, for example a botanist who \ufb01rst encounters a specimen of an unknown species and is trying to understand its properties, or a chemist who has discovered a new element and is attempting to determine its reactions to various agitations. But then again, scientists who discover an undocumented phenomenon or material do not know a priori its potential behaviors that they have yet to witness (e.g., green), so that their interactions with the phenomenon are not oriented toward generating any speci\ufb01ed goal state. As such, the MIT task is rather unique.\n\nIn addition to analyses of student unmediated discovery (Abrahamson et al., 2011), researchers have examined the design from the perspectives of human computer interaction (Howison et al., 2011), design heuristics (AbraQ10 hamson & Trninic, 2011), and design process (Trninic,\nReinholz, Howison, & Abrahamson, 2010). Yet another approach to understanding embodied learning includes a close look at classroom gestures, perspectivity (Goldman-Segall & Maxwell, 2003, and \u201ccubist compositions\u201d (Nemirovsky et al 1998.). Nemirovsky, who was inspired by his work with Seymour Papert\u2019s notion of becoming the turtle when learning programming, along with Ferrara propose that mathematical reasoning proceeds through a process of imagining a situation from various viewpoints, through a form of \u201ccubist composition\u201d en route to articulating the rules and principles that unify knowledge of the whole. In their studies, they found that gestures were an essential modality for composing these partial perspectives of the whole.\n\nThe perspective of the gesture has received little attention in studies of gestures in classroom learning with the exception of studies by Crowder and colleagues (Crowder, 1996; Crowder & Warburton, 1995). Crowder\u2019s studies indicated that \ufb01rst- and third-person perspectives in\ngesture re\ufb02ected different knowledge orientations with a subjective, exploratory approach to knowing re\ufb02ected in \ufb01rst-person perspectives, and a summative approach re\ufb02ected in the third person. Many representational gestures convey a sense of being performed from a \ufb01rstor third-person perspective, what has been termed the \u201ccharacter viewpoint\u201d (McNeill, 1992). Crowder\u2019s work as well as McNeill\u2019s resonates closely with the theoretical underpinnings of Edith Ackermann\u2019s focus on perspectivetaking (Ackermann, 1995). In that same period, Goldman- Q11 Segall took a similar view on the need for subjective, \ufb01rst-person perspective as a way to reach con\ufb01gurational validity (1995)\u2014multiple viewpoints that become robust by \u201clooking through layers\u201d of interpretation (1996). Students learn to program by building physical artifacts that represent a \ufb01rst-person embodied object/subject-to-thinkwith. Enabling children to not only create their \ufb01rst-person viewpoints, but also critically share their collective viewpoints, building thick interpretations (2008, p. 24; 1998;).\n\nFor example, demonstrating the embodied understanding of children learning to make circles in the Logo programming language, Goldman-Segall\u2019s \ufb01lm called \u201cThe Growth of a Culture\u201d (1988) shows a group of girls making a circle with their bodies. When asked to make a circle as the Logo turtle would, Tnisha did not turn 360 degrees from one standpoint, but rather walked around the circle as the turtle icon in Logo would have done: forward 50, right angle 90\ndegrees, over and over again. At the same time, she looked into the camera saying that the circle is \u201cright here,\u201d while she gently pounded her left chest with her right palm of her\nhand. Papert in a \ufb01lmed documentary by Goldman-Segall (1990) said his classic line that young children learn to program and to think mathematically through becoming the turtle. Clearly, Papert was pointing toward what we are calling, empathic embodiments.\n\nIn a more recent exploratory case study in a junior high school programming class, Kwah & Goldman (2011) observed, interviewed, and videotaped teacher gestures during instruction as well as both teacher and student gestures during problem-solving interactions. They found\nthat \u201ca teacher\u2019s gestures are \ufb02exible constructions that enable programming concepts to be visibly modeled from multiple perspectives.\u201d (p. 1) More interesting, given that gestures are visible actions, students shared (mirrored), as artifacts of embodied imagery, the teacher\u2019s gestures while explaining the same ideas to their peers. While Kwah and Goldman are not, from this exploratory study, generalizing that students mirroring of teacher gestures increases learning, this research does indicate that gestures can serve as an aid for teachers to explain complex ideas of programming not as accessible to learners in more abstract ways. In short, understanding which gestures can promote understanding could become part of a cognitive toolkit for teachers that would bene\ufb01t student learning. In conclusion, although embodied interaction is the keystone activity in a multibillion-dollar gaming industry, sometimes called Body Movement-Controlled Video Games (BMCVGs), it is still little understood from a learning-sciences perspective, yet appears to promise rewarding design-based research into the nature of knowing, teaching, and learning.\n\nPIONEERING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS\n\nIn this age of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of other social media environments, games for learning environments, and handheld smart device to augment learning and create  communities, it is dif\ufb01cult to select the educational tools and decide which were the most pioneering ones that led to the kinds of tools and environments we use every day. Handheld computational devices are now ubiquitous and continually changing with each new \u201cApp.\u201d People of almost every age, socioeconomic, and ethnic background, country, and gender are texting, tweeting, and sharing private photos and videos. Websites and online tools are used continuously to share, promote, and \ufb02ame. They have become part of the mediated reality within which work, study, and play are mediated.\n\nOn buses, subways, trains, planes, and while crossing city intersections, people are connecting with each other. If there is one thing the Arab Spring that \ufb01rst erupted in Tunisia on January 9, 2011\u2014with protesters confronting the regime of the president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali\u2014taught us, it is that people have access to mobile handheld devices that are not only phones, but have the capacity to communicate instantly, create groups, share images and text, and whatever else can be found somewhere on the web in seconds, engaging in a new form of public-centric journalism and curatorialship. The average person with effort can become a knowledge maker, a\ntrendsetter, an investigator, and an expert who has curatorial power, if only over certain domains. A compelling personal narrative or story has become the vehicle for power, even political power as it is played out every day, not only by presidential hopefuls, but by leaders of repressive and violent groups. At this time, the quality of learning with these social media devices is not easy to evaluate\u2014the major critique being that the networked population is distracting itself to death, a play on the title of Neil Postman\u2019s book in 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Other critiques are that\nmultitasking, the method of moving around the various applications with different purposes, leads to shallow concentration and lack of focus. Others argue that the human mind is capable and ready for this kind of activity. That boredom is the real villain of learning. Others argue\nthat social media, games, and sur\ufb01ng the web expand our ability to learn, help us keep in touch with communities and individuals, and promote new ways to socialize, \ufb01nd partners, and select friend recommended hotels, run businesses, and shop. There is some truth to both sides of each of these arguments, as one might expect. Early adopters are enthusiastic about what is coming down the pike and fall into each new device with few complaints.\n\nLuddites refuse to give up their vinyl albums and enjoy the time and space that the lack of constantly learning the next application affords. Added to those extremes, there is every shade between the two poles. More and more, parents, teachers, and users create methods to control time online and keep balance in the lives of their children and their own lives. In short, the jury is still out about the effectiveness of using social media as a learning device in spite of the fact that it seems like a seductive augmentation tool for accessing an in\ufb01nite amount of information and fun.\n\nThe authors of this chapter now focus on the historical roots of these current digital media environments, making the case that the earlier software were precursors to social media and games for learning. This next section is a selection of some of the pioneering and perspectival technological systems developed to aid, enhance, and inspire learning and research using one or more elements of the Points of Viewing Theory. This montage is an authorial selection, not a representation of all pioneering systems for learning. It provides the reader with a snapshot of precursor tools rooted in the role of learners to build their own environments and become partners in the learning and research process.\n\nLOGO\n\nLogo, one of the oldest and most in\ufb02uential educational technology endeavors, dates back to 1967. Logo is a dialect of the AI research language LISP, and was developed by Wally Feurzig\u2019s team at BBN, working with Papert. This program made computer programming accessible to children, not through dumbing down computer science, but by carefully managing the relationship between abstract and concrete. Logo gave children the means to concretize mathematics and geometry via the computer, which made them into explorers in the \ufb01eld of math. As mentioned before, Papert believed that if the best way to learn French is not to go to French class, but rather to spend time in France, then the best way to learn mathematics would be in some sort of \u201cMathland\u201d (Papert, 1980, p. 6). Logo provided a microworld operating in terms of mathematical and geometric ideas. By experimenting with controlling a programmable \u201cturtle,\u201d children had direct, concrete experience of how mathematical and geometric constructs work. Through re\ufb02ection on their experiments, they would then come to more formalized understandings of these constructs. Children became epistemologists thinking about their thinking about mathematics by living in and creating computer cultures.\n\nWith the growing availability of personal computers in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Logo turtle was moved onscreen, and the notion of the turtle in its abstract world called a microworld, a notion that has been the lasting legacy of the Logo research (Papert, 1980). The Logo movement was popular in schools in the 1980s, and versions of the language were developed for different computer systems. Some implementations of Logo departed from geometry microworlds, and were designed to address other goals, such as the teaching of computer programming (Harvey, 1997). Implementations of Logo are freely distributed on the Internet. See www.cs.berkeley.edu/\u223cbh/logo.html. The Logo Foundation at http:/el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/logo-foundation/ has continued to expand the culture of Logo over the years.\n\nSqueak\n\nSqueak is the direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s Dynabook research at Xerox PARC; the Dynabook was built the 1970s. Squeak is a multimedia personal computing environment based on the SmallTalk object-oriented programming language that formed the basis of Kay\u2019s investigations into \u201cpersonal\u201d computing (Kay, 1996). It is notable in that it is freely distributed on the Internet, runs on almost every conceivable computing platform, and is entirely decomposable\u2014while one can create new media tools and presentations as with other environments, one can also tinker with the underlying operation of the system\u2014how windows appear, or how networking protocols are implemented. A small but enthusiastic user community supports and extends the Squeak environment, creating such tools as web browsers, music synthesizers, three-dimensional graphics toolkits, and so on entirely within Squeak. See www.squeak.org.\n\nBoxer\n\nBoxer is a \u201ccomputational medium\u201d\u2014a combination of a programming language, a microworld environment, and a set of libraries and tools for building tools for exploring problem solving with computers. Developed by diSessa, Boxer blends the Logo work of Papert (1980) and the \u201cmutable medium\u201d notion of Kay (1996) in a \ufb02exible computing toolkit. diSessa\u2019s work has been ongoing since the 1980s, when he conceived of an environment to extend the Logo research into a more robust and \ufb02exible environment in which to explore physics concepts (diSessa, 2000). Boxer is freely distributed on the Internet.\n\nHyperCard\n\nIt is important to remember that in 1987 Apple Computer was exploring multimedia as the fundamental rationale for people wanting Macintosh computers. But, as there was little multimedia software available in the late 1980s, Apple decided to bundle a multimedia authoring toolkit with every Macintosh computer. This toolkit was HyperCard, and it proved to be an enormously popular with a wide variety of users, and especially in schools. HyperCard emulates a sort of magical stack of 3 \u00d7 5 index cards, and its multimedia documents were thus called stacks. An author could add text, images, audio, and even video components to cards and then use a simple and elegant scripting language to tie these cards together or perform certain behaviors. Two broad categories of use emerged in HyperCard: the \ufb01rst was collecting and enjoying predesigned stacks; the second was authoring one\u2019s own. In the online bulletin board systems of the early 1990s, HyperCard authors exchanged great volumes of \u201cstackware.\u201d Educators were some of the most enthusiastic users, either creating content for students (a stellar example of this is Apple\u2019s Visual Almanac, which married videodisc-based content with a HyperCard control interface) or encouraging students to create their own. Others used HyperCard to create scaffolds and tools for learners to use in their own media construction. A good snapshot of this HyperCard authoring culture is described in Ambron and Hooper\u2019s Learning with Interactive Multimedia (1990). HyperCard development at Apple languished in the mid-1990s and disappeared in the 2000s.\n\nConstellations/WebConstellations/Orion 1.0/Orion 2.0\n\nBuilding on the HyperCard platform, Learning Constellations (Goldman-Segall, 1989) was a collaborative video annotation tool that builds on the metaphor of stars (video chunks) and constellations (collections). Star video chunks could be combined to make constellations, but different users may place the same star in different contexts, depending on their understanding by viewing data from various perspectives. Learning Constellations was a datasharing system, promoting Goldman-Segall\u2019s notion of con\ufb01gurational validity by allowing different users to compare and exchange views on how they contextualize the same information differently in order to reach valid conclusions about the data (Goldman-Segall, 1995; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). It also features collaborative ranking and annotation of data nodes. While other video analysis tools were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s, (Harrison & Baecker, 1992; Kennedy 1989; Mackay, 1989; Roschelle, Pea, & Trigg, 1990), Learning Constellations (aka Constellations) was the \ufb01rst video date analysis tool to analyze a robust video ethnographic data (Goldman-Segall, 1989, 1990, 1991).\n\nContinuing to use the HyperCard plaftorm, GoldmanSegall developed a updated version of Learning Constellations as a stand-alone application in 1993. She added a signi\ufb01cance measure to layer descriptions and \u201crate attributes\u201d the themes and keywords (Goldman-Segall, 1993). In 1998, the tool went online as a web-based collaborative video analysis tool called WebConstellations (Goldman-Segall, 1998c, 1999; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). Every media type\u2014website page, text document, video chunk, or photo could become a star chunk and could be tagged, rated, and juxtaposed for comparative analysis. The most recent version, Orion 2.0 returned back to its original functionality of being a tool only video chunking, sorting, analysis, ethnographic theory-building and story-making. As a perspectivity technology, individuals enter into Orion, creating their own home page and inviting others to join in the analysis. Taking a lead in feature development, by 2007 each user could have a number of simultaneous projects with diverse research communities, in somewhat the same way that social media now enables groups to work.\n\nAdventures of Jasper Woodbury\n\nJasper Woodbury is the name of a character in a series of adventure stories that the (CTGV) use as the basis for \u201canchored instruction.\u201d The stories, presented on videodisc or CD-ROM are carefully crafted mysteries that present problems to be solved by groups of learners. Since the video can be randomly accessed, learners are encouraged to re-explore parts of the story in order to gather clues and develop theories about the problem to be solved. The Jasper series \ufb01rst appeared in the 1980s and there are now 12 stories (Cognition and Technology Group at\nVanderbilt University, 1997).\n\nCSILE/Knowledge Forum\n\nCSILE\u2014Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment\u2014was developed by Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) in the 1980s. CSILE is a collaborative, problem-based, knowledge-building environment. Learners can collaborate on data collection, analysis of \ufb01ndings, constructing and presenting conclusions by exchanging structured \u201cnotes,\u201d and attaching further questions, contributions, and so on to preexisting notes. CSILE was originally conceived to provide a dynamic scaffold for knowledge construction\u2014one that would let the learners themselves direct the inquiry process (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). CSILE is now commercially developed and licensed as Knowledge Forum.\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo are parallel-computing versions of Logo. By manipulating multiple (thousands), distributed \u201cturtles,\u201d learners can work with interactive models of complex interactions, population dynamics, and other decentralized systems. Developed by Mitchel Resnick, Uri Wilensky and a team of researchers at MIT, StarLogo was conceived as a tool to move learners\u2019 thinking \u201cbeyond the centralized mind-set\u201d and to study how people make sense of complex systems (Resnick 1991, 1994; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999). NetLogo\u2014an environment developed by Wilensky at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University is in widespread use both in education and\nresearch. Both of these are freely available on the Internet. See http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ and www.media.mit.edu/starlogo.\n\nMaMaMedia/World Wide Workshop\n\nThe World Wide Workshop is a global foundation for developing open-source applications of social media technology and game production, to enhance learning, innovation, entrepreneurship, and an understanding of the world in economically disadvantaged and technologically underserved communities (www.worldwideworkshop.org). An organization founded in 2004 by MIT Media Lab graduate and entrepreneur Idit Harel, World Wide Workshop addresses the problem of closing the digital divide and transforming education by reaching low socioeconomic youth in low-performing schools with learning networks and by taking a systemic approach to education innovation and reform. In 2006, the World Wide Workshop launched the Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org). The Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org) is a \u201cblended learning lab\u201d that provides a year-long digital curriculum, tools, resources, student and educator data tracking, and professional development for educators to engage, motivate and advance students\u2019 STEM learning through game design.\n\nYoung people in middle school and high school ages are immersed in blended learning (combining online and onsite), becoming game designers and mastering creative computational skills and core content knowledge. Academic researchers from several countries work with the\nWorld Wide Workshop to study constructionist digital literacy, motivation and engagement, and how new technology innovation can inform, engage and transform students, teachers, schools and communities.\n\nThe underlying constructionist digital literacy approach stems from her MIT Media Lab research and was also present in an earlier company Harel founded in the 1990s called MaMaMedia. The rationale of MaMaMedia was to enable kids and their parents to participate in web experiences that are creative, safe, constructionist by nature, and educational. Harel\u2019s book, Children Designers (Harel, 1991), lays the foundation for MaMaMedia, and for research in understanding how children in rich online environments construct software and design math games with representations of their thinking. MaMaMedia enabled girls and boys to be online playing games, learning how participate in the vast MaMaMedia community.\nMOOSE Crossing\n\nGeorgia Tech researcher Amy Bruckman created MOOSE Crossing as part of her doctoral work at the MIT Media Lab. MOOSE Crossing can be characterized as an breakthrough combination of Papert\u2019s Logo/ microworlds, the \u201cmutable media\u201d notions of Alan Kay (Kay, 1996), and a MOO (Haynes & Holmevik, 1998)\u2014a real-time, collaborative, immersive virtual environment. MOOSE Crossing is a microworld that learners can themselves enter, designing and programming the virtual environment from within. It becomes a lived-in text that one shares\nwith other readers/writers/designers. Bruckman (1998) stated that this early innovation, MOOSE Crossing, was \u201ccommunity support for constructionist learning.\u201d Indeed, it was.\n\nCalling a software system a place gives users a radically different set of expectations. People are familiar with a wide variety of types of places, and have a sense of what to do there...Instead of asking What do I do with this software?, people ask themselves, What do I do in this place? The second question has a very different set of answers than the \ufb01rst. (Bruckman, 1998, p. 49)\n\nBruckman\u2019s thesis is that community and constructionist learning go hand in hand. Her ethnographic accounts of learners inside the environment reveals very close, very personal bonds emerging between children in the process of designing and building their world in MOOSE Crossing. \u201cThe emotional support,\u201d she writes, \u201cis inseparable from the technical support. Receiving help from someone you would tell your secret nickname to is clearly very different from receiving help from a computer program or a schoolteacher\u201d (p. 128).\n\nSimCalc\n\nSimCalc\u2019s tagline is \u201cDemocratizing Access to the Mathematics of Change,\u201d and the goal is to make the understanding of change accessible to more learners than the small minority who take calculus classes. SimCalc, a project at the University of Massachusetts under James Kaput working with Jeremy Roschelle, and Ricardo Nemirovky, is a simulation and visualization system for learners to explore calculus concepts in a problembased model, one that avoids traditional problems with mathematical representation (Kaput, Roschelle, & Stroup,\n1998). The core software, called MathWorlds (echoing Papert\u2019s \u201cMathland\u201d idea) allows learners to manipulate variables and see results via real- time visualizations with both animated characters and more traditional graphs. SimCalc is freely available on the Internet. See www.simcalc.umassd.edu/\n\nParticipatory Sims\n\nParticipatory Sims, a project overseen by Uri Wilensky and Walter Stroup at Northwestern University, is a distributed computing environment built on the foundations of LOGO that encourages learners to collaboratively explore complex simulations. The Participatory Sims project centers on HubNet, a \u201cClassroom-based Network of Handheld Devices and Up-front Computer,\u201d which allows learners to participate in models of dynamic systems (Resnick, 1996) in a live, classroom environment. \u201cThe emergent behavior (see Figure 1) of the system and its relation to individual participant actions and strategies can then become the object of collective discussion and analysis\u201d (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). See www.ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/ps/index.html\n\nCoVis\n\nCoVis\u2014\u201cCollaborative Visualization\u201d\u2014a project that ran from Northwestern University in the 1990s, was clearly a strong predictor of what was to follow in education. It focused on science learning through projects using a telecommunications infrastructure, scienti\ufb01c visualization tools, and software to support collaboration between diverse schools in distributed locations (Edelson et al.,1996). Much of learners\u2019 investigation centred on atmospheric and environmental studies, allowing wide-scale (across the United States) data sharing. Learners could then use sophisticated data analysis tools to visualize and draw conclusions. CoVis made use of a variety of networked software: collaborative \u201cnotebooks,\u201d distributed databases, system visualization tools, as well as the WWW and electronic mail. The goal in the CoVis project was for young people to study topics in much the same way as professional scientists do.\n\nNational Geographic Kids Network\n\nAnother example of an early perspectivity environment in the late 1980s and 1990s was the National Geographic Kids Network. A number of very large-scale research projects explored the possibilities of connecting multiple classrooms across the United States for data sharing and collaborative inquiry (Feldman et al., 2000). Programs like National Geographic Kids Network (NGKNet), an NSFfunded collaboration between the National Geographic Society and educational technology research center TERC reached thousands of classrooms and tens of thousands of students (p. 30). TERC\u2019s NGKNet provided curriculum plans and resources around issues like acid rain, and tools, which facilitated large-scale data collection, sharing, and analysis of results. Other projects, like Classroom BirdWatch and EnergyNet focused on issues with comparable global signi\ufb01cance and local implications, turning large numbers of learners into a community of practice doing distributed scienti\ufb01c investigation. Feldman, Konold, and\nCoulter note that these large-scale projects question the notion of the individual child as scientist, pointing instead toward interesting models of collaborative engagement in\nscience, technology, and society issues (pp. 142\u2013143). Needless to say this work still continues to impress. See http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/\n\nTapped In\n\nTapped In is a Multi-User Online Educational Workspace (MEOW) for teachers and education professionals. The Tapped In project, led by Mark Schlager at SRI, began in the late 1990s as a MOO (textual VR) environment for synchronous collaboration and has since grown into a sophisticated (Web + MOO) multimedia environment for both synchronous and asynchronous work, with a large and active user population (Schlager & Schank, 1997). Q12\n\nTapped In uses similar technological infrastructure to MOOSE Crossing, but has a different kind of community of practice at work within it; Tapped In functions more like an ongoing teaching conference, with many weekly or monthly events, workshops, and happenings. Tapped In is an exemplary model of a multimode collaborative environment. See www.tappedin.sri.com/\n\nCoWeb\n\nAt Georgia Tech, Mark Guzdial and colleagues at the Collaborative Software Laboratory (CSL) created a variety of software environments building on the original educational computing vision of Alan Kay in the 1970s (Kay, 1996); the computer can be a tool for composing and experiencing dynamic media. Growing from Guzdial\u2019s previous work on theCaMILE project (Guzdial, 1997)\u2014a web-based \u201canchored collaboration\u201d environment, CSL\u2019s CoWeb project explores possibilities in designing and using collaborative media tools online (Guzdial, 1999). CoWeb and other CSL work is largely based on the Squeak environment, a direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s research at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.\n\nWebGuide\n\nWebGuide, a web-based, collaborative knowledgeconstruction tool, was created by Gerry Stahl and colleagues at the University of Colorado (Stahl, 1999). WebGuide is designed to facilitate personal and collaborative understanding through mediating perspectivity via cultural artifacts. WebGuide acts as a scaffold for group understanding. WebGuide is a structured conferencing system supporting rich interlinking and information reuse/recontextualization, as well as multiple views on the structure of the information set. Learners contribute information from individual perspectives, but this information can later be negotiated and re-collected in multiple contexts construct.\n\nCHALLENGING QUESTIONS\n\nModels of Mind or Culture Creation?\n\nFrom the vantage point of the mid-1990s, Jerome Bruner looked back on the cognitive revolution of the late 1950s, which he helped to shape, and re\ufb02ected on a lost opportunity. Bruner had imagined that the new cognitive paradigm would bring the search for meaning to the fore, distinguishing it from the behaviorism that preceded it (Bruner, 1990, p. 2). And yet, Bruner writes, the revolution went awry, not because it failed, but because it succeeded:\nVery early on, for example, emphasis began shifting from \u201cmeaning\u201d to \u201cinformation,\u201d from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and computability as a necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. (p. 4)The information-processing model of cognition became so dominant, Bruner argues, and the role of meaning and meaning-making ended up as much in disfavor as it had been in behaviorism. \u201cIn place of stimuli and responses, there was input and output,\u201d and hard empiricism ruled again, with a new vocabulary, but with the same disdain for mentalism (p. 7). Bruner\u2019s career as a theorist is itself instructive. Heralded by Gardner and others as one of the leading lights of 1950s cognitivism, Bruner has since the 1980s been one of a small but vocal group calling for a return to the role of culture in understanding the mind. This movement has been tangled up closely with the evolution of educational technology over the same period, perhaps illuminated in a pair of titles that bookend one researcher\u2019s decade-long trajectory: Etienne Wenger\u2019s (1987) Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Tutoring Systems: Computational and Cognitive Approaches to the Communication of Knowledge and his (1998) Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity.\n\nParadigm Shift With Digital Media or Incremental Changes?\n\nIn his 1996 article, \u201cParadigm Shifts and Instructional Technology: An Introduction,\u201d Timothy Koschmann began by identifying four de\ufb01ning paradigms of technology in education. In roughly chronological (but certainly overlapping) order, these are: Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI), characterized by drill-and-practice and programmed instruction systems; Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which drew on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) research in order to create automated systems, which could evaluate a learner\u2019s progress and tailor instruction accordingly; the Logo-asLatin paradigm, led by Seymour Papert\u2019s \u201cmicroworld\u201d and children-as-programmers efforts; and \ufb01nally, ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), a \u201csocially oriented, constructivist\u201d approach that focuses on learners in practice, in groups. Koschmann invoked Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1996) controversial notion of the incommensurability of competing paradigms:\nKuhn held that the effect of a paradigm shift is to produce a divided community of researchers no longer able to debate their respective positions, owing to fundamental differences in terminology, conceptual frameworks, and views on what constitutes the legitimate questions of science. (Koschmann,1996, p. 2)Koschmann\u2019s analysis may well be accurate. The literature surrounding the effects learning technology produces certainly displays examples of this incommensurability, even within the writings of individual theorists. A counter perspective to Kuhn\u2019s view of paradigmatic shifts in scienti\ufb01c understanding was offered by Stephen Toulmin (1972), who argued that conceptual change must Q13 not be understood as a globally uni\ufb01ed, systematic shift in attitudes in beliefs about science; rather, it was a fragmented process, which was highly contextualized and dependent on local scienti\ufb01c practices. According to Toulmin, knowledge develops in a more piecemeal fashion rather than through seismic leaps; \u2018competing\u2019 paradigms continue to exert considerable in\ufb02uence on our understanding. Andrea diSessa (2006), arguing for a reappraisal Toulmin\u2019s neglected work on conceptual change, applied it to how the \u201cintuitive ideas\u201d which young learners brought to a physics lesson were crucial resources for developing \u201cknowledge in pieces,\u201d or the weaving of various threads of ideas into a \u201cdifferent, stronger, and more normative conceptual fabric\u201d (diSessa, 2006, p. 273). The application of these ideas to learning technologies casts doubt upon the notions of internal coherence of individual paradigms and their representative designers, as well as their impermeability to each other.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Papert\u2019s work with teaching children to program in Logo was originally concerned with bridging the gap between Piaget\u2019s concrete and formal thinking stages, particularly with respect to mathematics and geometry. But over time, Papert\u2019s work with children and Logo began to be talked about as \u201ccomputer cultures\u201d (Papert, 1980, pp. 22\u2013 23): Logo gave its practitioners a vocabulary, a framework, and a set of tools for a particular kind of learning through exploration. Papert envisaged a computer culture where children could express themselves as epistemologists, challenging the nature of established knowledge. But while Papert\u2019s ideas and the practice of Logo learning in classrooms contributed signi\ufb01cantly to the esprit de temps of the 1980s, it was dif\ufb01cult for many mainstream educational researchers and practitioners to adopt the mindset he believed would revolutionize learning.\n\nA large-scale research project to evaluate the claims of Logo in classrooms was undertaken by researcher Roy Pea (when he was at Bank Street College) and his colleagues in the mid-1980s. The Bank Street studies came to some critical conclusions about the work Papert and his colleagues were doing (Pea & Kurland, 1987 [1984]; Q14 Pea, Kurland, & Hawkins, 1987; Pea, 1987). Basically, the Bank Street studies concluded with a cautious note: they concluded that no signi\ufb01cant effects on cognitive development could be con\ufb01rmed, and called for much more extensive and rigorous research amid the excitement and hype. The wider effect of the Bank Street publications fed into something of a popular backlash against Logo in the schools. A 1984 article in the magazine, Popular Psychology summarized the Bank Street studies, and suggested bluntly that Logo had not delivered on Papert\u2019s promises.\n\nPapert responded to this critique (Papert, 1987 [1985]), arguing that the framing of research questions was overly simplistic. Papert chided his critics for looking for cognitive effects by isolating variables as if classrooms were \u201ctreatment\u201d studies. Rather than asking \u201ctechnocentric\u201d\nquestions like \u201cWhat is THE effect of THE computer?\u201d(p. 23), Papert called for an examination of the culturebuilding implications of Logo practice, and for something he called computer criticism, which he proposed as akin to literary criticism.\n\nPea and others responded (Pea, 1987b), claiming that Papert had unfairly characterized the Bank Street research (Papert had responded only to the Psychology Today article, not to the original literature), and arguing that as researchers they had a responsibility to adhere to accepted scienti\ufb01c methods for evaluating the claims of new technology. The effect of this exchange was to illuminate the vastly different perspectives of these researchers. Where Papert was talking about the open-ended promise of computer cultures, Pea and his colleagues, developmental psychologists, were evaluating the work from the standpoint of demonstrable changes in cognition (Pea & Kurland1987 [1984]). While Papert accused his critics of reductionism, Davy (1985) likened Papert to the proverbial man who looks for his keys under the streetlight \u201cbecause the light is better there.\u201d\n\nGavriel Salomon and Howard Gardner responded to this debate with an article that searched for middle ground (Salomon & Gardner, 1986): an analogy, they pointed out, could be drawn from research into television and mass media, a much older pursuit than educational computing, and one in which Salomon was an acclaimed scholar. Salomon and Gardner argued that one could not search for independent variables in such a complex area; instead, they called for a more holistic, exploratory research program, one that took more than the overt effects of the technology into account.\n\nIndeed, in 1991, Salomon and colleagues David Perkins and Tamar Globerson published a groundbreaking article that shed more light on the issue (Salomon et al., 1991). To consider the \u201ceffects of\u201d a technology, one had to consider what was changed after a learner had used a technology\u2014but in the absence of it. The questions that arise from this are whether there is any \u201ccognitive residue\u201d from the prior experience, and whether there is transfer between tasks. This is a different set of questions than arise from investigating the \u201ceffects with\u201d technology, which demand a more decentered, systemwide approach, looking at the learner in partnership with technology.\n\nWhile it contributed important new constructs and vocabulary to the issue, the Salomon, Perkins, and Globerson article is still deeply rooted in a traditional cognitive science perspective, like much of Pea\u2019s research, taking \ufb01rst the individual mind as the site of cognition. Salomon,\nPerkins, and Globerson, all trained in cognitive psychology, warn against taking the \u201ceffects with\u201d approach too far, noting that computers in education are still far from ubiquitous, and that the search for the \u201ceffects of\u201d is still key. From the perspective of today\u2019s ubiquitous computing technologies, which have taken the \u201ceffects with\u201d study of technology \u201cout of the lab,\u201d and into countless informal settings, a less rigid cognitive orientation is now the norm for understanding technology\u2019s diffuse, yet constitutive effects on human interaction and community building. The most visible example is the revolution in online social networks, online game play, and social\nmedia in general.\n\nIn a 1993 article, Pea responded to Salomon et al. (1991) from yet a different angle. Pea, now dean at Northwestern and working closely with his Learning Sciences colleagues, wrote on \u201cdistributed intelligence,\u201d and argued against taking the individual mind as the locus of cognition, criticizing Salomon and colleagues\u2019 individualist notions of cognitive residue:\nThe language used by Salomon et al. (1991) to characterize the concepts involved in how they think about distributed intelligence is, by contrast, entity-oriented\u2014a language of containers holding things. (Pea 1993, p. 79) Pea, reviewing literature on situated learning by Brown et al. (1996 [1980]), Lave (1988), Wenger and Lave (1991), Greeno (1997) and by Winograd and Flores (1986), changed from the standard individualist framework of cognitive science to a more \u201csituative perspective\u201d while Salomon (1993) maintained that cognition must reside in the individual mind. Neither Salomon nor Pea in this exchange were comfortable with the notion of culture-making as a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to mind, artifacts, and such empirically identi\ufb01able constructs. However, Pea\u2019s work on distributed cognition had a great impact on future studies on cognition in the context of emerging media technologies.\n\nThe question needs to be asked, are these advances made with the introduction of digital media technologies representative of a paradigm shift or are they merely a conversation among differing points of viewing, based on different measures and methods of studying the problem. Indeed, it seems that the proof is in the pudding. A cultural shift has occcured. The next step it to harness the scholarship to create a vision for seriously changing how learning can be re-created with more engagement and involvement with all the stakeholders. To be able to \ufb01nd the patterns in current research so that less time is spent in debates and more on reaching agreements.\n\nDevelopmental or Narrative Appoaches to Learning Theory?\n\nUnderstanding the nature of technology-based learning systems greatly depends on one\u2019s conceptualization of how learning occurs; is learning linear and developmental, or a more \ufb02uid and even random \u201csystem\u201d of making meaning of experience? Proponents of stage theory have tried to show how maturation takes place in logical causal sequences or stages according to observable stages in growth patterns\u2014the \ufb01nal stage being the highest and most coveted. Developmental theories, such as Freud\u2019s oral, anal and genital (Freud, 1952), Erikson\u2019s eight stages of psychological growth from basic trust to generativity (Erikson, 1950), or Piaget\u2019s stages from sensori-motor to formal operational thinking (see Grubner & Voneche, 1977), are based on the belief that the human organism must pass through these stages at critical periods in its development in order to reach full healthy integrated maturation, be it psychological, physical, spiritual, or intellectual. Strict adherence to developmentalism, particularly its unidirectional conception, has been signi\ufb01cantly challenged by Gilligan (1982), Gardner (1985), Fox Keller Q15 (1983), and Papert (1986), not to mention a wave of postmodern theorists\u2014proposing theories which address the fundamental issues underlying how we come to terms with understanding our thinking. One such challenge, raised\nby Ivan Illich and Barry Sanders (1984), re\ufb02ects on the Q16 prehistorical signi\ufb01cance of the narrative voice. Thinking about thinking as essentially evolving stages of development requires the kind of calibration only possible in a world of static rules and universal truths. They point out\nthat narrative thinking is rather a weaving of different layers or versions of stories that defy developmentalism.\n\nNarratives are never \ufb01xed in time or place. Before the written word and [p]rior to history...there is a narrative that unfolds, not in accordance with the rules of art and knowledge, but out of divine enthusiasm and deep emotion. Corresponding to this prior time is a different truth\u2014namely, myth. In this truly oral culture, before phonetic writing, there can be no words and therefore no text, no original, to which tradition can refer, no subject matter that can be passed on. A new rendering is never just a new version, but always a new song. (p. 4) Illich and Sanders contend that the prehistoric mode of thinking was a relativistic experience; that what was expressed at any given moment in time changed from the previous time it was expressed. There could be no \ufb01xed recall, nor \u201ctruth\u201d as we de\ufb01ne it today. This concept of knowledge as a continually changing truth, dependent on both communal interpretation and storytellers\u2019 innovation, dramatically changed with the introduction of writing.\n\nThe moment a story could be written down, it could be referred to. Memory changed from being an image of a former indivisible time to being a method of retrieving a \ufb01xed, repeatable piece or section of an experience. In other words, narrative intelligence is not acquired developmentally in stages, but rather, phenomenologically and emotionally, through experience. The development of prehistoric thinking (with image and imagination) through historical thinking (with writing and conceptual schemes) has also been called posthistorical thinking (Flusser, 2004).Q17 Beginning with photography and on through networked computing devices, new\nimage-based media, while born in conceptual thought, has enabled learners to tap into their \u201cimaginal capacity\u201d to re\ufb02ect on their own learning processes and rede\ufb01ne the world through multiple representations of knowledge, also changing the notion of a \ufb01xed truth.\n\nAnother notion to Illich and Sanders emerges in Carol Gilligan\u2019s research on gender and moral development (1982). Gilligan makes the case that the \u201cdifferent voice\u201d women bring includes an ethic of care, a tie between relationship and responsibility (1982, p. 173). Gilligan set the stage for a new mode of research, which includes intimacy and relationship rather than separation and objectivity, the tenets of traditional empiricism. Evelyn Fox Keller, a leading critic of the masculinization of science, heralded the relational model as a legitimate alternative for doing science. She pointed out that science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity (1985), historically preferential to a male and objectivist manner of thinking. Combining Thomas Kuhn\u2019s ideas about the nature of scienti\ufb01c thinking with Freud\u2019s analysis of the different relationship between young boys and their mothers and between girls and their mothers, Fox Keller analyzed underlying reasons for scienti\ufb01c objectivism. She claimed that boys are encouraged to separate from their mothers, and, girls to maintain attachments, in\ufb02uencing the manner in which the two genders relate to physical objects. The young boy, in competition with his father for his mother\u2019s attentions, learns to compete in order to succeed. Girls, not having to separate from their mothers, \ufb01nd that becoming personally involved\u2014getting a feeling for the organism, as Barbara McClintock (Fox Keller, 1985) would say\u2014is a preferred mode of making sense of their relationship with the physical world. Q18\n\nAs a result, girls may do science in a more connected style, seeking relationships with, rather than dissecting, what they investigate. Girls seek to understand meaning through these personal attachments. Just as science is not the purely cognitive endeavor we once thought it, neither is it as impersonal as we thought: science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity. (1985, p. 7) Obviously, we will never know if a scienti\ufb01c discipline would really be different if it had been driven by more relational or narrative in\ufb02uences. Yet we may want to ask how people with a tendency toward relational or narrative thinking can be both invited into the study of the sciences and be encouraged to contribute to its theoretical foundations. And, we may want to ask how new media and technologies expand how we study what we study, thereby inviting a range of epistemologically diverse thinkers into the mainstream of intellectual pursuits.\n\nBricolage and/or the Ecology of Digital Media\nTechnologies\n\nIn her \ufb01rst book, The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (1984), Sherry Turkle explored the different styles of mastery that she observed in boys and girls in Logo classrooms. Returning to this topic, Turkle and Papert, in their 1991 article, \u201cEpistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete,\u201d outline two poles of technological mastery: hard and soft. Hard mastery, identi\ufb01ed with top-down, rationalist thinking, was observed in a majority of boys. Soft mastery, identi\ufb01ed with relational thinking and Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019s notion of \u00b4 bricolage, was observed in a majority of girls working with computers in a Boston elementary school (Turkle & Papert 1991, pp. 167\u2013168). The identi\ufb01cation of soft mastery and bricolage in programming was a turning point that led to a deeper examination of \u201cthe concrete,\u201d a subject woefully undervalued in contemporary life, and especially in math and science education.\n\nStanford scholar, Brigid Barron (2006) found that \u201clearners use strategies consistent with the bricoleur image described by Turkle, building on the concept introduced by Levi-Strauss [1966] where information is \ufb02exibly gathered and put together for new purposes.\u201d Barron revisited the role of the bricoleur to expand on what Nardi and O\u2019Day (1999) call information ecologies. Not only are information ecologies a product of both relational and material resources as Nardi and O\u2019Day suggest, but also, according to Barron, dynamic learning systems include a range of multiple in\ufb02uences that are dovetail well with understanding learning in formal and informal learning settings. She concludes with a call for changes.\n\nThe reports from the young learners shared...suggest that we should expect interest in learning to originate within and outside school and that adolescents have a signi\ufb01cant role to play in sustaining their own development. As researchers interested in human development, we are in a vital position to help envision what self-sustaining learning ecologies might look like and investigate how resourcefulness might be nurtured. (Barron, 2006, p. 221) Turkle and Papert\u2019s use the terms bricoleur and the notion of hard and soft to explain different approaches to computation, extends to other important domains: ecological stances, feminism, and ethnography of science and computation (1991, p. 372). They propose that hard and soft styles of creating knowledge and understanding systems as equally signi\ufb01cant to concrete thinking will gain respectability in the scienti\ufb01c community by attending more to the softer concrete way of thinking.\n\nThe development of a new computer culture would require more than technological progress and more than environments where there is permission to work with highly personal approaches. It would require a new and softer construction of the technological, with a new set of intellectual and emotional values more like those we apply to harpsichords than hammers. (Ibid, p. 184) Goldman-Segall offered a dynamic and \ufb02exible conceptualization of diversity of thinking called thinking attitudes (Goldman-Segall, 2008). These attitudes imply positionality and orientation, and are situated in time and place. She de\ufb01ned thinking attitudes as a transitional position held for a shorter period of time, one that is \ufb02uid and \ufb02exible (p. 245) This notion of thinking attitudes includes: meta/physical, historical, ethical, and pedagogical attitudes. Meta/physical attitudes address the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d They explore how children address causality, intention, existence, and truth. The meta/physical attitudes in adolescents are turning points, referring to the worlds of invention and imagination\u2014attitudes that are rooted in the physical situatedness of their interactions with the world. Historical attitudes address how things began. They encompass learning from the past and making sense of it. Ethical attitudes include our actions in relation to desire and external norms. Balancing right and wrong is particularly challenging. These attitudes address questions such as: \u201cWhat is fair?\u201d To a great extent, pedagogical (or activist) attitudes overlap with ethical attitudes. Pedagogical attitudes are concerned with such questions as \u201cWhat can we do? How do we change? How do we teach others to learn from what we did?\u201d Video excerpts available on the web: www.pointsofviewing.com\n\nThis dynamic epistemological theory of learning led to ways of knowing that include gender\ufb02exing: boys may take on thinking attitudes that are traditionally associated with those of girls, and vice versa (Goldman-Segall, 1996b, 1998a. 1998c). The underlying theme here is the primacy of situated points of viewing, rather than essential qualities. Learners become ethnographers, observing and engaging with the cultural environments in which they participate. She also recommends knowledge framing (1998). Framing is rooted in several diverse but interwoven contexts: Frames\u2014in contrast to the more essentialist notion of styles\u2014include the context set by the framer, what is framed, as well as what is left out of the frame. In other words, for learning, it is more important to have \ufb02exible thinking attitudes about the content knowledge so that the frames that are applied to that cluster of knowledge are appropriate and useful in understanding the domain under investigation. Related uses of framing can be found in the work by Marvin Minsky\u2019s on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (1986), Howard Gardner on multiple intelligences (1985), Erving Goffman on everyday sociology (1986), and Trinh Minh T. Ha on cinematography (1992).\n\nDistributed Cognition and Situated Learning\n\nOver the next decade, the focus had changed from understanding the mind of one child to understanding the situated minds of learners in collaborative teams. Simultaneously, learning environment theories moved to social constructionism, to problem-based learning (PBL) environments spearheaded by Cindy Hmelo-Silver and Howard Barrows, (2006), as well as to rich-media cases of teaching practices. The 1989 article by John Seely Brown, Alan Collins, and Paul Duguid called \u201cSituated Cognition and the Culture of Learning\u201d (1996 [1989]) is generally credited with introducing the concepts and vocabulary of situated cognition to the educational community. This in\ufb02uential article, drawing on research at Xerox PARC and at the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), expressed the authors\u2019 concern with the limits to which conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is situated and learned (p. 19), as is common practice in classrooms. Building upon the experiential emphasis of pragmatist thinkers like John Dewey and on the social contexts of learning of Russian activity theorists like Vygotsky and Leontiev, Brown and his colleagues proposed the notion of cognitive apprenticeship. In a cognitive apprenticeship model, knowledge and learning are seen as situated in practice: \u201cSituations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\u201d (p. 20). This idea is carried forward to an examination of tools and the way in which they are learned and used:Learning how to use a tool involves far more than can be accounted for in any set of explicit rules. The occasions and conditions for use arise directly out of the context of activities of each community that uses the tool, framed by the way members of each community see the world. The community and its viewpoint, quite as much as the tool itself, determine how a tool is used. (Brown et al., p. 23)\n\n\nThe work that brings the situated perspective \ufb01rmly home to the learning environment is Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger\u2019s Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation (1991), which goes signi\ufb01cantly beyond Brown\u2019s cognitive apprenticeship model. Core to Lave and Wenger\u2019s work is the idea of knowledge as distributed or stretched across a community of practice\u2014what Salomon later called the \u201cradical situated perspective\u201d (Salomon, 1993).\n\nIn our view, learning is not merely situated in practice\u2014as if it were some independently rei\ufb01able process that just happened to be located somewhere; learning is an integral part of generative social practice in the lived-in world\u2026Legitimate peripheral participation is proposed as a descriptor of engagement in social practice that entails learning as an integral constituent. (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 35) This perspective \ufb02ips the argument over: it is not that learning happens best when it is situated (as if there were learning settings that aren\u2019t situated), but rather, learning is an integral part of all situated practice. So, rather than asking\u2014as Bransford and colleagues at Vanderbilt had\u2014\u201cHow can we create authentic learning situations?\u201d they ask \u201cWhat is the nature of communities of practice?\u201d and \u201cHow do newcomers and old-timers relate and interact within communities of practice?\u201d Lave and Wenger answer these questions through elaborating the nature of communities of practice in what they term legitimate peripheral participation.\n\nBy this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate in communities of practitioners and that mastery of knowledge and skill requires newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. (p. 29)\n\nLave and Wenger also elaborate on the involvement of cultural artifacts and technologies within communities of practice. As knowledge is stretched over a community of practice, it is also embodied in the material culture of that community, both in the mechanisms of practice and in the shared history of the community:Participation involving technology is especially signi\ufb01cant because the artifacts used within a cultural practice carry a substantial portion of that practices heritage \u2026Thus, understanding the technology of practice is more than learning to use tools; it is a way to connect with the history of the practice and to participate more directly in cultural life. (p. 101)\n\n\nArtifacts and technology are not just instrumental in embodying practice; they also help constitute the structure of the community. As Goldman-Segall, in her 1998 book, Points of Viewing Children\u2019s Thinking: A Digital Ethnographer\u2019s Journey, reminds us,The [tools we know have] are not just tools used by our culture; they are tools used for making culture. They are partners that have their own contribution to make with regard to how we build a cultural understanding of the world around us.... Readers of our socially constructed texts can either be silent lurkers or decide to make their presence known to us. Layers build. Patterns emerge, friendships or enmities grow, and digital inquiry becomes a re\ufb02exive practice\u2014with an emphasis on \ufb02exing, stretching, and strengthening our inquiry. (pp. 268\u2013269)\n\n\nSituated cognition, then, becomes perspectival knowledge, and the tools and artifacts we create become what Goldman coined \u201cperspectivity technologies\u201d: viewpoints, frames, lenses, and \ufb01lters; re\ufb02ections of selves with others. To understand the signi\ufb01cance of perspectivity in the role of learning, one has to turn to recent studies on the other side of the coin\u2014perception. This renewed interest in perceptually grounded research, or embodiment, encompasses the continually interacting parts of making meaning.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this chapter, the Points of Viewing Theory was applied to an already rich understanding of the use of computers, the Internet, and digital media. The range of possible contributors was so broad that we decided to focus only on those theories and tools that were directly connected with the notion of perspectival knowledge construction and perspectivity technologies. To those researchers whose work is not described in this chapter, we regret that we did not \ufb01nd the opportunity to include your work.\n\nPerspectivity technologies (Goldman, 2007) represent the next phase of thinking with our technology partners. Not only will we build them, shape them, and use them. They will also affect, in\ufb02uence, and shape us. They will become, if some researchers have their way, part of our bodies, not only augmenting our relationships but becoming members in their own right. As robotic objects become robotic subjects, we will have to consider how Steven Spielberg\u2019s robot in the movie AI felt when interacting with humans\u2014and hopefully we will be kinder to ourselves and to our robots. Thus, a perspectivity technology is not only a technology that enables us to better see each other\u2019s viewpoints and make decisions based on multiple points of viewing. It is also concerned with the creation and design of technologies that add perspectives. Technologies have built-in \ufb01lters. To explain this brie\ufb02y, one need only think of how recording an event with pen and paper, an audiotape recorder, and a digital video recorder each provide different perspectives of the same event. The technology provides an important \ufb01lter or lens. A viewpoint, one could say. And although that viewpoint is deeply in\ufb02uenced by who the \ufb01lmmaker is, or who the reporter is, there is a perspective that is contributed by the technology. A camera tells a different story than the audio or text tool.\n\nAs we use new media as communication devices, they affect how we communicate; they participate by being what they are, having a capacity to shape the story. Beyond the media is the message theme of Marshall McLuhan (1964), we are now deeply entrenched in a participatory relationship with our new media technologies because they have become part of our perspective, our consciousness, and our way of life. The level of interaction with our virtual creatures (technologies) transforms our relationships. We are never completely alone. We are connected through media devices even if we cannot see them. They see us.\n\nThat said, what has changed in learning? It might seem we have moved a long way from believing that learning is putting certain curriculum inside of students\u2019 heads and then testing them for how well they have learned that material. Yet, instructionism is still alive and well. From kindergarten to higher education, students are still being trained to be able to pass tests that will provide them with entrance into higher education. In spite of learning theories moving from behaviorism to cognitivism to distributed and situated cognition, educators are caught in the quagmire of preparing students for their future education instead of trying to make the present educational, engaging, and challenging fun. Teachers are caught in an entangled web of uncertainty as they scramble to learn the new tools of the trade (the Internet, distance learning environments, etc), learn the content they have to teach, and then organize the learning into modules that will \ufb01t into the next set of learning modules.\n\nThe irony is that when we think of who our best teachers were, they were the teachers who were able to elicit something within us and help us connect our lives to others\u2019 lives. Not a technology thing! The lives of poets, mathematicians, physicists, and the \ufb01sher down at the docks. These teachers created a sense of community in the classroom. We became part of a discovery process that had no end. Ideas came together that had not yet been put together\u2014at least in our own minds. We felt we invented something new. And indeed we and others\nwithin these learning environments did invent new ideas in our minds. Yet, people say that this cannot happen to most students in most classes and the best we can do is to teach the curriculum, provide a safe learning environment, and test people for what we wanted them to learn. This is not good enough. And if students do not become partners in their learning now, technologies will create islands of despair as more and more students stop learning how to be creative citizens interested in each other, in difference, and in understanding complexity. And technology could open up a gulf between people as well as lack of boundaries between work and play. In Sherry Turkle\u2019s book, Alone Together (2011) she explores these problematics of computer use reminding us about a serious problem facing a technologically seduced society. She argues that we are losing our sense of community, that being together in online environments, such as Facebook for example, can create more aloneness.\n\nConnectivity technologies once promised to give us more boundaries between work and leisure. But as the cell phone and smartphone eroded the bounndaries between work and leisure, all the time in the world was not enough. Even when we are not \u201cat work,\u201d we experience ourselves \u201con call\u201d; pressed, we want to edit out complexity and \u201ccut to the chase.\u201d (Turkle, 2001, p. 12) These comments have raised some online readers to \u201cpush-back,\u201d to use a common vernacular. In an online discussion, W\u0142odzimierz Sobkowiak, a professor of English philology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland asks:Why should communities of necessity be \u201cconstituted by physical proximity only\u201d is beyond me, frankly, so I\u2019ll not even try to analyze this claim [by Turkle]...I can assure the reader that the shared concerns, real consequences, and common responsibilities\u2019 present in those environments are felt as not a bit less real than in the so-called Real Life. (Retrieved on August 15, 2011, from http://grou.ps/zajek/blogs/item/sherry-turkle-alonetogether)\n\n\nAlthough technologies have become many things for many people, they can be designed for the creative sharing of perspectives and viewpoints that lead to building better communities of practice in our schools and in our societies. Since the attack on the World Trade Center more than a decade ago on September 11, 2001, we have come to realize that the world is not what we thought it was. We know so little about each other. We know so little about the world. Our educational lenses have focused too long on educational goals that acted as blinders to the world around us. We thought we did not need to understand each other and out diverse perspectives on the world.\n\nThat one view of knowledge was enough. Yet, what we know and what we make is always a re\ufb02ection of our beliefs and assumptions about the world. We need to build new bridges in a socially constructed interconnected world where people have access to each other\u2019s customs, languages, and world views. And, we must rely on our technologies to build connections with peoples we do not know so that the gulf between us lessens. Perspectival knowledge, knowledge gleaned from being able to see others\u2019 perspectives, enables students, educators, and the public at large to take a second and third look at the many lenses which make up the human experience, even if from a distance. The purpose is not to always approve of what we see, but to learn how to put different worldviews into a new con\ufb01guration and uncover paths we might not yet see. And we might, if we are brave enough, respect students not only for what has been taught them after they have taken prescribed courses and completed assignments, but also respect them the moment they walk through the door\u2014or through the online portal as they engage in the formal or informal learning habitat.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbrahamson, D., Trninic, D., Gutierrez, J.

from classics mit by\u00a0Homer\u00a0(Greek Text) Pat Spillane", "The Odyssey, Book XXI translation from classics mit Lyrics\n\nIn this excerpt Penelope finally gives in to the suitors and tells them that the one that completes the task at hand then she will marry him. However, the task she gives to the suitors is a task that is near impossible and they only one who had previously completed the task was Odysseus. Penelope described the task to the suitors, they were to string the bow of odysseus and then shoot an arrow through the handles of 12 axes onto a target. None of them will complete this task, but then odysseus in a disguise as Telemachus' guests asks if he can attempt the task at hand. The suitors get angry, but Telemachus insists that he is able to try. With ease Odysseus strings the bow and fires an arrow through all 12 axe handles. With the task complete it was clear that Telemachus' guest was in fact Odysseus returning to his kingdom.\n\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's bow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child.\"\n\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others on to do so also.\n\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\n\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\n\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.\"\n\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, \"My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall take the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.\"\n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\n\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.\"\n\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.\"\n\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.\n\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\n\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do- to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?\"\n\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might so ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might and main I would fight for him.\"\n\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:\n\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\n\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\n\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for the axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow- the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.\"\n\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:\n\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have made an end of it.\"\n\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.\"\n\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.\"\n\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.\"\n\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up the estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall surely be- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.\"\n\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here.\"\n\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\n\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to death.\"\n\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.\"\n\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's apartments.\n\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his neighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.\"\n\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\"\n\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\n\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver- he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\n\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.\"\n\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's seat.\n\nWorks Cited:\nPenelope's Cleverness.
