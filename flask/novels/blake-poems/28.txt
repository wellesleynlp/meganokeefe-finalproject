Cloud Nine Lyrics

[Verse]
The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one-room shack we slept in, the children beside me
We hardly had enough food or rooms
It was a hard time
Needed something to ease my troubled mind
Ooh listen
Father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected Mama and treated her slightly
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
The first thing, downhearted, I took to Cloud 9
I'm doing fine up here on Cloud 9
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine up here on Cloud 9
Folks now tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance
And don't let life pass you by"
But the world around you is a rat race
Where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
It ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night

[Chorus]
I'm doing fine on Cloud 9
Let me tell you about Cloud 9
(Cloud 9) You can be what you want to be
(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) Yeah, every man, every man is free
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I want to say (up) higher (up up and away)
Cloud 9

[Bridge]
I want to say I love the life I live
And I'm going to live the life I love
Up here on Cloud 9
Uh uh uh uh, I'm riding high on Cloud 9

[Chorus][x2]
