O Christmas tree Lyrics

[Verse]
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
With faithful leaves unchanging
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
With faithful leaves unchanging
Not only green in summer's heat
But also winter's snow and sleet
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
With faithful leaves unchanging
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely[x2]
Each year you bring to me delight Gleaming in the Christmas night
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Your leaves will teach me also[x2]
That hope and love and faithfulness
Are precious things I can possess
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Your leaves will teach me also
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches[x2]
In summer sun or winter snow coat of green you always show
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches
