Cloud 9 Lyrics

I'm sitting waiting on cloud nine
Sitting here waiting on cloud nine
What do I have to do, man?
Tell me what is going on
Tell me what is going
If I remain strong I'll go to heaven where I've been

She comes to me with open arms
She's an angel, she's an angel
We float away but she brings me back
Did I do something bad I ask myself

Thrash, bash, kill myself, eat a bunch of trash
Thrash, bash, get some cash and spend it on some drugs
Explode into a million pieces so no one can find me
Because I'll be on cloud 9
Cloud 9

Going out of my mind
Raining down on cloud nine
Nothing I can do, man
Tell me what is going on
Tell me what is going
If I remain strong I'll go to heaven where I've been

She comes to me with open arms
She's an angel, she's an angel
We float away but she brings me back
Did I do something bad? I ask myself

Thrash, bash, kill myself, eat a bunch of trash
Thrash, bash, get some cash and spend it on some drugs
Explode into a million pieces so no one can find me
Because I'll be on cloud 9

Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9
Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9

Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9
Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9

Call me when the sun goes down
Down
Call me when the sun goes down
Call me when the sun goes down

Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9
Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9

Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9
Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9

Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9
Cloud 9, Cloud 9
Send me away to cloud 9

Call me when the sun goes down
