Green Lyrics

Take off my nothing inside
Take off my nothing inside
Green green green green
Temple's ends, your secret guide

I'll be packing hip young beat
Grand thy them their rights
And they're still with us, fires got extinguishers
Require time

Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it

Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Fake it, take it, leave it, feel it
Green green, green, green
