Go Green Ranger Go (Redux) Lyrics

Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go

Goldar's gonna get you, tonight
(Destroy the Power Rangers and destroy the world!)
Don't let Lord Zedd, put a spell on your mind

Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go go

Go Green Ranger
Go Green Ranger
Go Green Ranger
Go Green Ranger
Go Green Ranger
Go Green Ranger

Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go

Goldar's gonna get you, tonight
(Send down the monsters to destroy the world!)
Don't let Lord Zedd, put a spell on your mind

Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go
Go Green Ranger, go go
