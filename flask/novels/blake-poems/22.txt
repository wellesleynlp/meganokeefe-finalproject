Fail Lyrics

So much they break
So much new to be done
The final is tomorrow
Feels like they began
And all Im sayin
I need to do my news too
I won't do anything
If you see it I like it
I won't do anything
Dont call me lazy
I go down
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
When youre done for the day
I m right down
I only imagine you and who we are
Bet you got it served
On the back on your way
That the sky is your ceiling
So dont call me lazy
I go down on you daily
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
Touch a a cloud, boy
I said
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
I said
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
I said
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
You dont know how I got up in the sky
I didn't even touch a a cloud, boy
