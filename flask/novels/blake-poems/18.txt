Oh Christmas Tree Lyrics

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging
Not only green, in summer's heat, but also winter's snow and sleet
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
Each year you bring to me delight, gleaming in the Christmas night
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, you're leaves will teach me also
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, you're leaves will teach me also
That hope and love and faithfulness are precious things I can possess
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, you're leaves will teach me also

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, how lovely are your branches
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, how lovely are your branches
In summer sun or winter snow, a coat of green you always show
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, how lovely are your branches
How lovely are your branches
How lovely are your branches
