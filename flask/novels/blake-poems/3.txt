Green Henry Lyrics

He came to town when I came of age
Full of piss and full of rage
He thought that he could serve me well
By drowning me in the wishing well

Oh, Green, Green, Green Henry

He bothers me when I'm alone
Strips my mood like Acidtone
Applies the pins right to my heart
He'd like to tear me apart

Oh, Green, Green, Green Henry
Oh, Green, Green, Green Henry

Turns me in, turns me out
Makes me dim, makes me doubt
Everything, everything I do is wrong

Oh yeah, oh yeah (oh yeah), oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

(solo)

He's always sayin' I'm no good
Now I don't understand what's understood
So I killed him once and I realize
My Green Henry never dies

Green, Green, Green Henry
Oh, Green, Green, Green Henry
Oh, Green, Green, Green Henry
(Come on, come on, come on, oh)
Green, Green, Green Henry
