O Christmas Tree Lyrics

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho tree most fair and lovely
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho tree most fair and lovely
The sight of thee at Christmas time
Spreads hope and gladness far and wide
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho tree most fair and lovely
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho has the wonderous message
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho has the wondrous message
You bring us happiness and worth
Good will to men and peace on earth
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree
Tho has the wonderous message
