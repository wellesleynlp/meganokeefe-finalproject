I Saw Three Ships Lyrics

I saw three ships comes sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships comes sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning

And what was in these ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in these ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas Day in the morning

Pray, wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Pray, wither sailed these ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning

Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the bells on earth shall ring
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the souls on earth shall sing
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Let us all rejoice on end
On Christmas Day in the morning
