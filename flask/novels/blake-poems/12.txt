O Christmas Tree Lyrics

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!

Every year this Christmas tree
Brings to us both joy and glee
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!

Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!

Each bough does hold its tiny light
That makes each toy to sparkle bright
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!
