by\u00a0Herman\u00a0Melville", "Moby-Dick (Chap. 134: The Chase -- Second Day) Lyrics\n\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\n\n\"D'ye see him?\" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread.\n\n\"See nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;\u2014the top-gallant sails!\u2014aye, they should have been kept on her all night. But no matter\u2014'tis but resting for the rush.\"\n\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.\n\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.\n\n\"By salt and hemp!\" cried Stubb, \"but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave fellows!\u2014Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea,\u2014for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!\"\n\n\"There she blows\u2014she blows!\u2014she blows!\u2014right ahead!\" was now the mast-head cry.\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" cried Stubb, \"I knew it\u2014ye can't escape\u2014blow on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your trump\u2014blister your lungs!\u2014Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!\"\n\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\n\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting things\u2014oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\u2014yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n\n\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. \"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then disappears.\"\n\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as\u2014much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead\u2014Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.\n\n\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n\n\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand!\u2014Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore. The boats!\u2014stand by!\"\n\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.\n\n\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat\u2014a spare one, rigged the afternoon previous. \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine\u2014keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\"\n\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale head-and-head,\u2014that is, pull straight up to his forehead,\u2014a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again\u2014hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls\u2014when lo!\u2014a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!\n\nCaught and twisted\u2014corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached within\u2014through\u2014and then, without\u2014the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks\u2014dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.\n\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man's line\u2014now parting\u2014admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;\u2014in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,\u2014Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,\u2014as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again\u2014gunwale downwards\u2014and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\u2014modifying its direction as he struck the surface\u2014involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.\n\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\n\n\"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\"\n\n\"The ferrule has not stood, sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up; \"I put good work into that leg.\"\n\n\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\n\n\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!\u2014d'ye see it.\u2014But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?\u2014Aloft there! which way?\"\n\n\"Dead to leeward, sir.\"\n\n\"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the spare boats and rig them\u2014Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat's crews.\"\n\n\"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane\u2014there, that shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By heaven it cannot be!\u2014missing?\u2014quick! call them all.\"\n\nThe old man's hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the Parsee was not there.\n\n\"The Parsee!\" cried Stubb\u2014\"he must have been caught in\u2014\"\n\n\"The black vomit wrench thee!\u2014run all of ye above, alow, cabin, forecastle\u2014find him\u2014not gone\u2014not gone!\"\n\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Stubb\u2014\"caught among the tangles of your line\u2014I thought I saw him dragging under.\"\n\n\"MY line! MY line? Gone?\u2014gone? What means that little word?\u2014What death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry. The harpoon, too!\u2014toss over the litter there,\u2014d'ye see it?\u2014the forged iron, men, the white whale's\u2014no, no, no,\u2014blistered fool! this hand did dart it!\u2014'tis in the fish!\u2014Aloft there! Keep him nailed\u2014Quick!\u2014all hands to the rigging of the boats\u2014collect the oars\u2014harpooneers! the irons, the irons!\u2014hoist the royals higher\u2014a pull on all the sheets!\u2014helm there! steady, steady for your life! I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I'll slay him yet!\n\n\"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,\" cried Starbuck; \"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man\u2014In Jesus' name no more of this, that's worse than devil's madness. Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone\u2014all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:\u2014\n\n\"What more wouldst thou have?\u2014Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,\u2014Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!\"\n\n\"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we both saw\u2014thou know'st what, in one another's eyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand\u2014a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act's immutably decreed. 'Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.\u2014Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. 'Tis Ahab\u2014his body's part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick\u2014two days he's floated\u2014tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he'll rise once more,\u2014but only to spout his last! D'ye feel brave men, brave?\"\n\n\"As fearless fire,\" cried Stubb.\n\n\"And as mechanical,\" muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he muttered on: \"The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.

Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.", "http://genius.com/Herman-melville-moby-dick-chap-134-the-chase-second-day-annotated"], "725743": ["Hilarious by\u00a0Louis\u00a0CK", "Hilarious Lyrics\n\n[Soft, indistinct chatter]\nYou have your key in there, sir? Yeah.\n[Scattered cheers, shouting]\nHouse lights? Go--wally, go on house lights. You ready? Spotlight. Spotlight. Spotlight.\n[Cheers and applause]\n\nThank you. Hi. Thank you very much. Uh, Thank you. Hello, everybody. Um, Hello. I mean, by everybody, I mean, uh, you guys. Uh, I mean everybody who's here. Really I shouldn't say \"everybody,\" because most people are not here. By a pretty huge majority, most people are not here. Most people are in China, actually. It's true. Actually, that's not true. Most people are dead. Did you know that? It's true. Out of all the people that ever were, almost all of them are dead. There are way more dead people.\nAnd you're all gonna die, And... And then you're gonna be dead For way longer than your life. Like, that's mostly What you're ever gonna be. You're just dead people That didn't die yet. That's... There are so many dead people. Ray Charles is dead. Hitler. Bunch of other ones. But mostly those two guys. And... It's true. Ray Charles and Hitler Are both dead. And really it's the only thing They have in common, Because otherwise They're very different dudes. Many contrasts between Hitler And Ray Charles. I'm gonna tell you A few of 'em. Um, Ray Charles was black. Hitler was not. Hitler killed several Jews. Too many. I'll say too many. He killed an excessive amount of Jews. He really... Beat that thing to the ground. He killed way-- He just--no moderation. Ray Charles, meanwhile, Hardly any Jews. He killed so few Jews.\n\nUh... I don't know How to start Shows. It's just a problem That I have. I never... I never figured out how to come Out and just start talking, Because the first thing You say on stage Always feels stupid, Because there's no real reason For me to talk to you. It just doesn't exist. I don't know you. You don't--you're-- You don't even know each other. You're facing The same direction. That's all You have in common. So i just have to...Bleh! It's like talking To a girl at a bar Because You're attracted to her. The first thing you say Is just gonna be dog shit Coming out of your mouth. Because you don't know her. The only honest thing That you could say to her Is \"i want To fuck your face.\" That's the only thing You could say That you could mean. Anything else you say Is you trying really hard Not to say \"I want to fuck your face.\" That's the only thing you're-- \"Hi, i want To put my penis in... The lowest hole In your head.\"\n\nI was never good at that. Like, I was very bad At being single, Which is a problem, Because i'm divorced, So i'm single again. After ten years of marriage, and-- No, here. Cut the shit. Don't even start With that noise Like a puppy died. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. And this is important, Because someday one of your Friends is gonna get divorced. It's gonna happen. And they're gonna tell you. Don't go, \"oh, i'm sorry.\" That's a stupid thing to say. It really is. First of all, You're making 'em feel bad For being really happy, Which isn't fair. And second--let me explain something to you. Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, But it's true, because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It's really that simple. That's never ha-- That would be sad, If two people were married And they were really happy, And they just had a great thing, And then they got divorced, That would be really sad. But that has happened Zero times. Literally zero. Ray Charles Has killed more Jews than happy marriages have ended in divorce. So if your friend Got divorced, it means things were bad, and now they're-- I mean, they're better. They're not good. Life is shit wall to wall, but they're better, so you should be happy. But the part that's difficult is being single at 41 After ten years of marriage and two kids. It's--that's like having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn't exist anymore. Like... Like i found 500 million Prussian francs. I can't really take Advantage of being single, because i didn't-- I didn't expect to be single. I'm not prepared. I didn't think i'd ever be-- I didn't keep this shit up. You understand? I didn't maintain any of this at presentation condition. It's function only. It was not... I didn't think I would need it that way. I thought i was going to be shoving it into the same person every three months Till one of us died. That's... What i thought was the nature of the deployment for this... I didn't think I had to be, like, appealing to someone From scratch. It's like having a-- It's like having a '73 Dodge dart in your backyard. And it's been sitting back there With grass growing-- You don't have any-- It's not an old mustang. You have no plans To restore that dart. You don't even see it When you look out the window. And now you find out That's your only way to work. You need that car now. And you're like, \"Oh, shit, i-- \"I didn't take-- It's got bees in it. \"I didn't take care of it. \"It's full of bees. \"There's a family of mice Living in the tailpipe. I can't take that to work.\" I have no single instincts. I know too much to be single. I know everything That happens now. That's no good for single. You got to be optimistic To be single. Stupid. You have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means, You know? It means stupid. An optimist Is somebody who goes, \"Hey, maybe something Nice will happen.\" Why the fuck would anything nice Ever happen? What are you, stupid? But that's the attitude You have to be to be single. You have to look at somebody And go, \"ooh, maybe...\" I don't look at it that way, Even when i see somebody I'm attracted to. I was at a gym the other day. Why? Why? I'm at a gym. I'm just wearing shorts. That's all i'm doing there. Just standing there. And i look over, And there's a girl on the-- You know, with a ponytail, And she's on this thing-- And i'm looking at her, And i'm like, \"Oh, she's awesome. Shit.\" But then i start thinking, Wait a minute. I'm single. I'm on the market. I have value. I could say something To her. I could just walk up And say something. And i'm trying to think-- \"What am i gonna say?\" What does--what do i look like To somebody like that? And then i realize It's been way too long. I've just been standing there, Staring at her. [Grunts] I want her! I have no identity In the single world. I can't--i look at them, I don't know what they're doing. I--i tried just jerking off Ito Girls Gone Wild The other day. Just to re-enter The community that way. Just to feel part of it. And i bought it. Not the commercial On Comedy Central. I paid money like a grown-up. I put my credit card down And waited for it To come to my house. I'm an adult. Iso i'm trying to jerk off To Girls Gone Wild. I can't do it, 'Cause i'm a father. I'm too old. I'm just getting mad At everybody in the video. I'm like, \"you fucking Irresponsible bitches. Go back to school. What are you doing down there?\" \"There's two wars And a depression. \"Put your--get the oil off your tits and study, For fuck's sake.\" I just don't look at a woman As a pair of tits anymore, And i wish i did, 'Cause i could get laid easier, 'Cause that's what it takes. Just to go-- [Grunting] But i can't now. Like, i went to a club. I went to a club, You know, like, a... [Imitates thumping club music] Like, a club. And i'm standing there Looking at all the people, And there's the women-- The hot chicks. The hot girl at the bar. You know when you see them, That's just--she's a hot girl At the bar. She's got the\u2014Got the shirt and the skirt, And the boots. Those three lines. It's, like, some Perfect ratio that they hit With those three lines, And you-- And they're all Standing there like that. And I used to look At somebody like that. I'm like, \"Wow, she's an angel. What could i ever say To make her like me?\" Now i look at her and i'm like, \"What is that? \"Is that even a person? \"What the fuck Kind of person is that? Is that an identity even? Who would want to be that?\" I have two daughters. I pray they don't Grow up to be the-- The hot girl at the bar. What kind of-- \"Hey, what do you do?\" \"People want to fuck me.\" Really? That's it? \"Yeah. \"I go to this club, and they Want to fuck me over here. \"Ha ha. Not you. Ha ha.\" And their male counterparts Are even more useless. The guys. The dudes--the going out To get laid dudes. You know those guys That walk in packs of nine Down the bar street. The going out To get laid guys. They all got the same Button-up, stripy, Going out to get laid Shirt on. They all got the same stride, And there's one short Guy behind them like\u2014And they-- They're all out to get-- Like, who's gonna Fuck all nine of you? What is the fantasy here? Are you gonna see nine women In the same configuration, And just all--? Are you all gonna walk Into a giant vagina somewhere? \"Ha ha! Dude!\" And then later they're in front of a pizza place, Just angry at each other. \"You said there was pussy there, You idiot!\" \"Shut up!\" Then they beat up a stranger And get the energy out that way. \"Faggot!\" Those are the most dangerous people, Are dudes That didn't get laid. They're just fucking-- [Grumbles] Just full of come Coming out of their eyes. \"Fucking--fucking\u2014Fuck somebody.\" Stand there. I love dudes That hang out together And do the whole-- I saw this group of guys, And one of 'em was such a guy, He had it turned up so high That it was crazy. His friends Were kind of normal. He was like-- I'm like, \"what? Is that-- That can't be real. That can't be a personality.\" Does he do that at 4:00 In the morning When he's peeing And nobody's in his apartment? He's like-- And he kept doing that gesture That guys like to do. The... That's my favorite Dumb guy gesture. Yeah. Pfft. Pffsh, yeah, right. I always wonder, What if there was a guy Who, whenever he does this, He has to finish. Like, just some guy Who works in your office. You ask him a question. \"Hey, is Bill in yet?\" \"Yeah, Like, he's ever on time.\" [Whispers] \"Oh, fuck.\" [Cheers and applause] [Breathes heavily] \"Oh, shit. \"Seriously, that dude's Always late, man. I'm serious.\" [Stammers] It's always an odd moment In a guy's life, The second after you come, And you're like-- [Shudders] Reality comes rushing back. 'Cause you've been Pushing reality away In pieces All night to get the-- \"Oh, no, it's fine. \"Yeah, no, It doesn't matter. \"No, i'll just Leave my car there. \"It doesn't matter. I'll just go... \"Doesn't matter... This is weird... Ah, fuck.\" And then You're just like-- You're like the Hulk coming back down to the other guy. My clothes are ripped And there's a dead guy here. I don't know what happened. I'm gonna get my duffle bag And leave town again. [Whistles] So this is A beautiful theater. I like what i do, Because i get to work In a lot of different places. And, uh, recently I did a show in New Jersey In the auditorium of a technical High School. I forgot that existed. technical High School. That's where dreams Are narrowed down. That's-- 'Cause we tell our children, \"You can do anything you want.\" Their whole lives. \"You can do anything.\" But at this place, We take kids-- Like, they're 15. They're young. And we tell them, \"You can do eight things. We got it down To eight for you.\" And i'm not saying These people are stupid. Because i'm stupid. I really am stupid, And it bothers me. Like, I wish i was more stupid, 'Cause then it wouldn't-- I would--just all My thoughts would just be-- [Murmuring] But instead, Here's how my brain works. It's stupidity Followed by self-hatred And then further analysis. It's not a very efficient System of thought. I have these dumb thoughts, \"Duh,\" And then i go, \"what the fuck Is wrong with you?\" And then i figure it out. But the impulse Is always stupid. Like, i saw this guy In New York one day, And he's walking his dog, And this is what i saw. The guy's got a-- He's got a coffee And a dog on a leash, And a phone. He's on the phone. So he's got His phone like this, And the dog's leash is going From the phone hand to the dog. And i look at this and i go, \"Oh, he's got, like, A dog phone.\" Like, that thought Sincerely inhabited me For, like, a full minute. I'm going, \"oh, I wonder What the benefits are To hooking Your phone up to a dog.\" And then the other part of me Had to go, \"Why the fuck Would that exist? You asshole.\" I had a string of bad-- Dumb thoughts the other day. I was--i don't remember What town i was in. I was on the road. I was just standing In front of my hotel. It was 5:00 in the afternoon. That's usually what i'm doing At 5:00 in the afternoon. Just standing in front of my hotel. Because i've been Inside all day. Just with the jacking off And the ice cream. It's just horrible. It's, like, a horrible thing. All day. Just depths of fucking hell. Just--i wake up, I get, like, chicken wings. Shit nobody eats At 10:00 a.M. Like, really--hot wings And i eat 'em all, And then i'm like, \"uh...\" So i get ice cream To cool it off, you know? Like... And then i feel worse, So i jack off and pass out. I turn off my phone In case my kids call. I can't fucking face anybody. I wake up covered with Three kinds of shame glaze Just covering my body. And so right around 5:00 In the afternoon It starts getting dark, And i'm like, \"i got to be In the daylight just once.\" I have to at least One time in the day Be in the daylight. And that's\u2014I just stand there. That's it. Like a fucking mental patient In a bathrobe. Just-- Cigarette burns On the robe and shit. Some girl telling me She got married. I'm not listening. \"Daddy, This is my husband.\" That's what it feels like, Anyway. And i started Looking at people, And they're all crispy-clothed And rosy-cheeked And full of purpose, And they're making me Feel worse. And i'm about to go back In the hotel And jack off another time. And then I look Across the street And i see this couple, And they were just striking. They were a beautiful couple. It was a beautiful woman With a beautiful man. I'll say he's beautiful. I got no problem with it. I'll suck his dick too. I don't need your permission. I don't care. Walk right over there And suck his dick. I mean, i never did that, But i'm 41. Maybe i'll do The second half gay. I don't know. It remains an option. There's got to be Something to it. Those folks Are having a good time. They have parades. They--there's no parades For how i get laid. They have parades. Marching down the street To celebrate that They blow each other And fuck each other In the ass. Smush their vaginas together, Or whatever that one is. Whatever wonderful thing Those folks are doing That's none of my business. So i--okay, So i'm looking at the couple, And they're walking On the other side of the street, And they have a child with them. But i can't see their child, 'Cause there's, like, A dumpster and some other stuff. I just see, like, A little head. And i'm waiting, i'm curious What their kid looks like, Because they're so beautiful. Maybe i want To fuck their kid. I don't know. [Laughs] That--that's just me Saying something terrible Because it makes me laugh That it upsets you. That's all that is. Just so you know. It's just--it's just enjoyable To me that you're upset. That's all it is. I'm not gonna fuck a kid. I wouldn't do that. Maybe a dead kid. Who are you hurting? He's dead. Who are you hurting? I'm not saying i would kill A kid and fuck him. I'm saying if i found A dead kid in a field And it wasn't raining, I might take a shot. I don't know. I haven't been In that situation. All right. [Laughs] Oh, sorry. All right. Okay. So i'm looking At the couple, and... [Sighs] They got a kid with them, And i'm curious What their kid looks like. And they come Around the corner, And they're--and this Is a true story. It wasn't a kid. It was a little old Chinese Woman walking next to them. And here's what My dumb brain tells me. I go, \"oh, that's what Their child is like.\" Not like, \"oh, she's A separate person. She's not with them.\" I'm like, \"Oh, that young couple \"Gave birth to a tiny, Elderly chinese woman. Isn't that interesting?\" And then the other Part of me had to go, \"Dude, you-- \"Yeah, that's what happened. Yes. Asshole.\" And then i was looking At the little old chinese lady. She was--there was A beauty to her. She's just tiny, little, Old ch - I was staring at her 'Cause i was fascinated by her. I don't know anybody like her, And I am so not A little old chinese lady. That i--i was like, \"What are her thoughts?\" That was what I was burning inside with. What is she thinking Right now? I can never know. And I really--the dumb brain Is telling me That she's just thinking-- [Imitates chinese] That's how dumb i am. That i think Chinese Gibberish that i made up... Is in her Actually Chinese mind. That's all. Just-- \"Me chinese.\" [Imitates chinese] Course i didn't--i can't know What she was thinking. She could be thinking Anything. \"Eh, black people steal.\" So i'm like-- She might-- I'm not saying they steal. I'm saying that fucking Racist chinese lady Might have been thinking it. She might have been. It's possible. And i went to England. I spent a month there. I liked England. Everything's different. I mean, that's obvious, But some of The differences were cool. I like the money, The money-- Instead of a dollar bill They have the pound coin. And it's a coin and You throw it on the counter. It felt kind of cool. Like the old west. Like going on the--you know, Being on the dusty trail. You see a saloon, so you walk Over to it with your horse. You throw the rope Vaguely at the pole outside. That thing they do. It's my whole life On that horse. Should be fine. Just... Walk in the saloon. \"Give me a beer, The bottle of whiskey, \"And a room for a week, \"Steak dinner, shave And a haircut and a bath, \"And some new clothes And a hat and some boots, And some oats for my horse, And a woman.\" Here you go. Ping. That's all. One heavy coin. You're fine. Nobody adds up all those things You mentioned. They don't check To see what coin it was. The guy just keeps Drying the glass. Things were very vague Back then. Things just cost money. \"Hey, how much is that?\" \"Money.\" In the old english movies, It was different. It was a little sack of coins. Remember that little Drawstring sack Tossed over By some faggy lord With a ruffled shirt. Throw it disdainfully down To some commoner Who's gonna do something Beneath his station. \"Follow the girl and report Back to me at midnight. \"Bring a shovel and a sack \"And two reliable men Such as yourselves. \"Oh, what's that? Oh, yes, of course. Well, This ought to be sufficient.\" Meh, just--shink. \"Oh, thank you, sir.\" The guy's so happy To get a general amount of some kind of currency or another. He didn't, like, count it. Like, \"i think you only gave me Enough for the shovel. There's not enough there.\" That was a good time In our economy, When you needed to have gold To buy shit. We might be going back to that Pretty soon too. Things are pretty fucked up. People are a little bit scared. But you know what? How bad could it really get? I mean, most Americans Have so much crap You could lose most of it And still be-- Have more shit Than the average Canadian, Even. Like, we're the fattest People in the world, And we just have All this shit, And we hate it. We're just miserable With our phones. \"Fucking...\" [Murmurs] Just angry all the time. And i worry about The economy failing, Because we don't-- We can't even-- We're miserable With a great life. Like, i don't know How the fuck We're gonna deal with, like, When you got to move your mom Into the cellar and shit And, like, have, like, Serious problems. Because we have, like-- Up till now, We have white-- We have white people problems In America, That's what we have. White people problems. You know what that is? That's where your life Is amazing, So you just make shit up To be upset about. People in other countries Have real problems. Like, \"oh, shit, They're cutting off All our heads today.\" Things like that. Here we make shit up To be upset about. \"Like, how come i have to choose A language on the atm machine? It's bullshit.\" \"I shouldn't have to do that. I'm American.\" God, the shit We bitch about. I called American Airlines, And i got a xstani lady. And she was in Pakistan. Only people near my fat, White body should have jobs. I'll tell you what, though. When i call American Airlines And i get the Pakistani lady, I hang up and i call again. I do. I'm gonna tell you honestly. And it's not because I don't like her, And it's not because She doesn't speak english, 'Cause she speaks Way better than i do. She's just a better person. It's so clear. And i know--here's why I don't like talking to her. 'Cause i know she doesn't Give a shit About me and My white people problems. I want to talk To the lady from Texas, Who's-- \"Well, how can i help you?\" That's the lady i want. I just know when i-- [Pakistani accent] \"Hello, American--\" \"Oh, fuck. You don't care.\" There's no way. Why would you? I'm in my underwear. \"Hi, i have a layover In Dallas that's really long, And i was wondering if--\" And she's like, \"Oh, really? \"I haven't had a clean glass of water in ten years, okay? \"Two of my kids Died this morning. \"I still came to work, You fat shit. \"I can hear your fat Over the phone. Why don't you hang up And kill yourself?\" Why would she care? But we just--God. Standing at the atm. \"I can't believe They make me go like this. Stupid.\" What the fuck Are you complaining about? You push a button and money Comes out a fucking slot. It didn't used to be that way. When i was younger, You had to go in the bank. Remember that? You had to go inside the bank. Now you look in the bank, You're like, \"what are those People doing in there? Are they cleaning? The money's out here.\" It's amazing how different Shit is now, And it hasn't been this way For a long time. It's been a very short time. Everybody has a phone In their pocket. It didn't used to be You had a phone-- Just a few years ago, Nobody had their phone. It was just the phone. It was this thing, the phone, That was in a room In your house. And then you had to dial This fucking thing. There was a rotor, And you had to turn it And go-- [Imitates rotary phone] You actually hated people With zeros in their numbers, 'Cause they made you do-- Well, this guy's got A zero and a nine. How badly do i want to talk To that piece of shit? That's too much work. Now we have this, Which is amazing. We have these phones that you Can call in an air strike. You can look at the top of your own head. It's amazing, this shit, And it's wasted On the shittiest generation of piece of shit assholes That ever fucking lived. I swear to God. We are. We're the worst people so far. Because we have This beautiful thing, And we hate it. We're just-- \"Fucking thing.\" I don't - Never saw a person going, \"Look at what My phone can do.\" Nobody does that. They all go-- \"Fucking thing, it sucks. I can't get it to--\" Give it a second, Would you? Could you give it a second? It's going to space. Can you give it a second To get back from space? Is the speed of light Too slow for you? You non-contributing, Product sponge cunt? Can you just wait? Can you just take A little breath? Just wait for that picture of Axl rose to get on your phone. Like it even fucking mattered What you were doing. Like it was even important. We're all just so mad. \"I hate my phone. It sucks!\" No, it doesn't. It's amazing. The shittiest cell phone In the world Is a miracle. Your life sucks Around the phone. Why are you so mad at it? People say The craziest shit. \"I--i hate Verizon.\" What are you talking about? How can that feeling exist? \"I hate Verizon!\" \"Why? Did they fire you And take away your pension?\" \"No, it just--couple of times It was weird for a second.\" [Grumbles] \"I hate them!\" Hate Verizon. Well, make your own, then. You go make one. Make your own network. Get some hubcaps And climb some trees. See how close Yours is to perfect. Why would it be perfect? Really, It's as good as it is. Why do we expect it To be fucking perfect All the fucking time? We're not contributing. We're not helping it be perfect. We don't even know what-- What is involved. Do you have any idea What is involved In taking your thing That you said That nobody needs To ever hear ever, When you go-- \"Hey, what's up, dude.\" [Blows raspberry] And a little, invisible, Magic angel takes it, and-- [Whooshes] God damn it. Ho--\"when did you Send me that text?\" If i sent it to you A month ago, it's amazing. Whenever it gets to you, It's amazing. Whenever it gets to you It's incredible. I don't know. I'm not that old. I'm 41. But i'm still amazed At the shit in my life. I'm amazed at the shit In the world. I was on a plane once, Like about a month ago, And they had high speed, Wireless internet on the plane, And they had never Done that before. They explained to us That we were, like, One of the first aircraft. And i opened up my laptop, And i'm online. I'm looking At youtube and shit While we're flying. And then it broke down. And the woman says, \"i'm sorry, But we have to fix the internet, So it's down For the rest of the flight.\" The guy next to me goes, \"It's fucking bullshit.\" I'm, like, \"dude, how does The world owe you something You didn't even know existed People on planes Are the worst. People on planes, They complain. They get off the plane, They come to your house, And they tell you about Your whole flight experience. And they make it sound Like it was fucking a-- A cattle car In Poland in the '40s. They just make it-- \"That was the worst Day of my life. \"I had to sit on the runway For 40 minutes.\" That's a story In this country. That's a fucking hardship, That you had to sit On the runway. People will listen To that story. They'll stop doing the dishes And turn around and go, \"Oh, my God, really? For 40 minutes? That's awful. You should sue them.\" \"I had to sit on the runway For 40 minutes.\" Oh, my God, really? What happened then? Did you fly through the air Like a bird? Incredibly? Did you soar Into the clouds impossibly? Did you partake In the miracle of human flight? And then land softly On giant tires That you couldn't Even conceive How they fucking Put air in them? How dare you. Bitching about flying. \"I had to pay For my sandwich.\" You're flying! You're sitting in a chair In the sky. You're like a greek myth Right now. \"But it doesn't Go back very far, And it's sort of Squishing my knees.\" The Wright Brothers would kick us all right in the cunt If they knew. If--if you could go back In time to Orville Wright And go, \"hey, dude, i had to sit On the runway for 40 minutes.\" And he'd be like, \"Oh, shit, Well, let's Not even bother, then.\" \"Hey, Wendell, shut it down. \"They make you wait for a bit. That hardly seems worth it.\" There's always delays. That's what everybody Complains about. There's always delays When i fly. Really? Delays. It's too slow. Air travel's too slow. New York to California In six hours. That used to take 30 years, To do that, And a bunch of you would die On the way there. You'd get shot in the neck With an arrow and you'd go-- [Gags] And fall down. And the other passengers Would just bury you And put a stick there with your Hat on it and keep walking. And one of 'em Would fuck your wife And have three babies. And all the old people Would die. You'd be a whole different Group of people By the time You got to California. Now you watch An Adam Sandler movie And you take a big, runny dump And you're there. I was, uh, i was flying About a week ago, And, uh, i was in the airport, And i saw this really old man, And he's on-- He's on a wheelchair. I can fucking hear That shit, So back the fuck off. I can hear It in your headsets. Just careful. Or turn them down. Sorry to fuck up The entire show for that, But i could hear-- [Imitates earpiece chatter] \"Get closer to him. \"No, it's okay, it's fine. Get closer to him. He won't mind.\" All right. Wait a second. [Cheers and applause] Okay, uh, This about where i was? Okay. [Audience member shouts] That's right. I was on a-- I was in the, um... I was in the airport. Ugh... Tot--just drenched right now. Totally drenched. It's like i peed. It's crazy. Okay, so i'm in the airport, And i'm going through security, And they bring this old man In a wheelchair, And he was... Crazy old. I mean, he was the oldest thing I've ever seen. I've been To museums and shit. This dude... I didn't know There had been as much time As this guy was old. I mean, He was at least forever. He was at least that old. Just tiny, Little nosferatu hands And eggy head. Just one of those... So frail. It was like Just the atmosphere Was crushing him Into a diamond. Just... [Screeches] And they're Pushing him through, And i'm not the only per-- Like, He was parting the people, 'Cause people were going, \"What the fuck? That's crazy. He's really old!\" And they take him Through security, And, you know, If you're really old Or you're in a wheelchair, You can't go through The metal detector If you're in a wheelchair, So they take you To secondary clearance, Which is far more stringent. Like, the oldest and feeblest People get the highest scrutiny. So they take him over there, And he's--i mean, he doesn't Even look good for infinity. He's not even like, a-- He's, like-- Got a whole thing going. And they take him over, And they start checking him For weapons. Like, thor--like, What do you got there, huh? Like, checking him. And they lift him-- I swear to God, They picked him up Gently out of the wheelchair By the shoulders, And he's standing between These two guys like this, And they're going-- [Imitates beeping] And i'm like, \"really? Is that the guy, fellas? \"You think that's the guy? Do you want to maybe Let him go?\" Let him enjoy the last Ten seconds of his life Doing something else. What--what is he gonna-- Even if he pulled it off, He deserves whatever he wanted, Really. What is he gonna do? Even if he had a grenade-- Let him keep it. And i know what they'd say. They'd be like, \"well, Where do you draw the line?\" He--this is the line. This guy right here, He's the actual line. It's very clear. There's always somebody going Through security who's like, \"I don't want To take off my shoes. \"Stupid. I'm not a terrorist.\" Oh, that's right. We only make Terrorists do that. I'm sorry. [Grumbles] That's what we sound like now. [Grumbles] Just the whole country. We're like Fat eighth graders. All of us. Just-- Not fair.\n\nBREAK FOR JOHN\n\nYou ever listen to people? When I was in England, I went into this caf\u00e9 full of Afghani people, and they're--they just had crackly energy to their language. I don't know what they were saying, but it was like\u2014kakahaifhatianapi [Imitates language]. There's energy. We don't have that anymore. You ever listen to people? You ever listen to what people really sound like? The other day I was in some whatever coffee--I don't know, you can only be in six places. Whichever one I was in, and I'm listening to just fat\nWhite people talk to each other. These two fat white guys behind me. One of 'em is like... [Mumbling, slurring] and his friend's like, \"I know, it's... [Mumbling, slurring]...Obama. \"These two women are talking. One of them's like...[Higher-pitched mumbling, Slurring] \"I know, it's...\"[Higher-pitched mumbling, Slurring]\"...Stephanie.\" Anyway, I was listening to the two guys, and one of 'em used a word that really pissed me off, because it was how he used it. He used the word \"Hilarious.\" That's one of those words that we use-- That we don't care what it means. We go right for the top shelf with our words now. We don't think about how we talk. We just say the-- right to the fucking just-- \"Dude, it was amazing. It was amazing.\" Really? You were amazed? You were amazed by a basket of chicken wings? Really? Amazing. What are you gonna-- What are you gonna do with the rest of your life now? What if something really happens to you? What if Jesus comes down from the sky and makes love to you all night long, and leaves the new, living lord in your belly? What are you gonna call that? You used \"amazing\" on a basket of chicken wings. You've limited yourself verbally to a shit life. All these words we use. \"Genius.\" That's-- You can\u2014anybody can be a genius now. It used to be you had to have a thought no one ever had before, or you had to invent a number. Now it's like, \"hey, I got a cup in case we need another cup.\" \"Dude, you're a genius.\" So these guys, they used \"hilarious,\" and I remember the context exactly, because I had the hate recorder running in the back of my head. I was just standing there fucking angry. I'm listening to 'em. One guy says to the other guy, he goes, uh, \"Hey, dude, so, uh... [Breathes heavily] So guess who i saw today.\" And his friend goes, \"Who?\" I swear to God that's how he said it. It just slid out. Just \"who?\" I was like, \"Tighten your lips up, man. Make an effort.\" \"Who.\" That's how a person talks. This guy, He's just secreting words out of the front of his head. \"Who?\" [Sputtering, slurring] So his friend goes, \"I saw Lisa today\u201d, and he goes, \"That's hilarious.\" How the fuck is that hilarious? That you saw Lisa. Is Lisa a poodle on her hind legs? How is that hilarious? Was she standing next to Jerry Lewis when he was younger? How the fuck is that hilarious? Do you know what \"hilarious\" means? \"Hilarious\" means so funny that you almost went insane when you heard that shit. It's just so funny that it almost ruined your life. You're homeless now because you can't cope or reason anymore because that hilarious thing Just shattered your mind, and three months later you got\nShit and leaves in your hair, and you're drenched in pee in the gutter. That's how funny \"Hilarious\" is. I don't know this Lisa cunt, but she ain't that funny. There's just no way. She's that funny on sight? Fuck her. Seriously. I hope she's dead. I really do. I hate her. I hope she died today, weirdly and horribly. I hope the person she loved most pushed her off a cliff, and she was just falling and screaming the whole way down, never accepting it. And then Superman swooped her up and then dropped her from higher.\n[Laughter and applause] I seriously hope that happened... to stupid Lisa. With her one tit bigger than the other, and her fucking frizzy hair, and her... her big nose. Fucking Jew. [Laughter]\nWhat am I doing? I've lost my mind. \"Jew\" is a funny word, because-- it is. Because \"Jew\" is the only word that is the polite thing to call a group of people and the slur for the same group. Most groups have a good and a bad-- theirs, the same word, just with a little stank on it, and it becomes a terrible thing to call a person. 'Cause you can say, \"He's a Jew.\" It's fine, but \"he's a Jew.\" Like, that's all it takes. I wish the president would slip one into a speech that's just on the border, just to fuck with people's heads. Just in the middle, you know. \"We all got to get along in this country. \"We need everybody. \"Blacks and whites and Christians and JEWS, and let's just try to...\" Hmm. I don't... can't call him on it, but that seemed inappropriate. Fucking Lisa. Fucking Lisa, man. It's just-- It didn't deserve that. The story didn't deserve-- here's what he should have said. This is what that story deserved. It should have been like, \"I saw Lisa today.\" The other guy should have said, \"That happened.\" That's it. That's all it deserved. He should have said, \"That happened,\" and then they just should have started making out. I don't know why I wanted that. I just wanted these two old fat guys to just start blowing each other on the floor. Not even gay blowing. Just awkward, heterosexual sucking, that they don't know what they're doing. And they don't even get hard partway through. They're just sucking each other's soft penises. And they're both crying, 'cause they're embarrassed and confused. Now that would be hilarious. Then you would have a story that you could call hilarious without being accused of hyperbole. It's amazing; the stories that people think are interesting. And that's always one of 'em, is when your friend ran into somebody from their past, and they can't wait to tell you. And first they want to tell you for 40 minutes How blown away you're gonna be that they saw this person. \"Dude, you're not gonna believe who I saw today.\" Yes, I am. Course I am. Don't even tell me. I don't care. \"No. No, dude. \"Dude! \"When you find out-- Holy shit! \"When you find out who I saw, \"You are gonna shit in your Father's mouth when I tell you. \"I'm serious! \"When I tell you who I saw, \"You are gonna kill, fuck, and eat four Mexican retarded kids when I tell you who I saw today. \"I'm s--you're gonna do that. \"I'm serious that you're gonna do that. \"You're not gonna-- \"You're just gonna rip out your asshole and throw it on the wall.\n\"It's gonna stick there, \"and you're gonna dive through it into another dimension.\" [Laughs] Tell you who I saw today.\nAnyway, I don't know why I\u2019m such an asshole. I really am. I have--I'm grumpy. I don't-- I get impatient with people quickly, you know? I just get tired of--when people are boring, I want to kill them, you know, and that's not fair. I used to like people more, but now I have children, and that changes your life. It changes your life in a lot of ways. Like, you spend a lot of time with people you never would have chosen to spend time with. Not in a million years. I spend whole days with people I'm like, \"I never would have hung out with you.\" I didn't choose you. Our children chose each other based on no criteria, by the way. They're the same size. They don't give a shit who they make me hang out with. My daughter had a play date the other day. This kid comes over, and his father brings him, and his father brings his fucking face into my house. And I have to ask it questions for an hour and a half. \"Ugh. What do you do? I don't care. God damn it. What other shit are you passing on to that little faggot you brought over here. \"To play with my kid? \"I don't--I hate your son.\u201d \"I hate him. He smells.\" Gets too close when he talks. \"Can I have raisins?\" Yes, you can have-- just...Stand... Dude, I'm not-- You're not mine. I don't love you. Do you understand? I don't have any--no love. None. I don't even have an instinct to protect you. I don't care if you die. I seriously--I won't feel anything if you die. I'll have to pretend. for your dad. I like kids. Parents, I'm not crazy about. Most parents-- like, this whole country, our thing is the children. We have to do it all for the children. And, meanwhile, nobody gives a shit about how they raise their kids. People put minimal effort into it. They have--their kids-- They're, like, consumers of their kids. Like, they want to call customer service.\n\"Why does he play video games all day? I don't understand why he plays video--\" Maybe 'cause you bought him A fucking video game, you idiot. Throw it a-- Throw it away! Who told you that was a good idea?\nA developing mind. [Grunts] Fucking idiots. My kids don't even watch television. And when I tell most other parents that, you know what they say? They go, \"Aw, fuck you.\" Why? \"Just 'cause fuck you. Fucking hippie weirdo.\u201d \"They're gonna grow up weirdos. 'Cause they don't watch just fucking anger and colors screaming in their face.\" [Screams] If your kids watch TV, Here's what you should do. Just--if you think that's really a good idea to have 'em watch TV, next time your kid's watching television, just come up behind them when they don't know you're there, and just turn it off without any warning. Just go--pfft. Watch what happens. They go-- [Screams] Do you think that's a good sign? You think it's a sign that it's healthy for them? That when it's taken away they go-- [Mutters] because you've created such a high bar of stimulus that nothing competes. A beautiful day is shit to a child now. A gorgeous, panoramic day with hawks catching fucking mice and flying away and bears with fucking fish in their teeth. And the kid's like, \"I want to watch the television! This is nothing!\" That's what's wrong with our kids. They can't just stand and be a person without-- Baa! Blah! And then the food-- We feed them food that tastes like insanity. It's insanity, our food. Do you under--you should be able to give a kid an apple, and they go, \"Oh, thank you. I love apples.\" Kids can't even taste--\nApples are like paper to them, because we fill 'em. We force them to eat-- People force their kids to eat fast food. I was in this hamburger-- This woman's, like, just Shoving French fries in the-- \"Eat it!\" The kid's, like, \"Mom, it's salty. It hurts. I can't eat anymore.\" \"Shut up. Have a soda.\" We give them MSG, Sugar, and caffeine, and, weirdly, they react to those chemicals. And so they yell, \"aah.\" And then we hit them. What fucking chance does a kid have? We pump the stuff in there. \"Aah!\" \"Shut up! \"Stop it. Why are you like this?\" \"'Cause I haven't had actual nutrition in eight years, mom. \"I'm dehydrated. \"Give me water. \"Pepsi's not water, you cunt. Give me a glass of water. I'm dying. I have sores on my tongue all the time.\" \"And stop hitting me. You're huge. How could you hit me?\nThat's crazy.\u201d  You're a giant, and I can't defend myself.\n\u201cI really think it's crazy that we hit our kids. It really is--here's the crazy part about it. Kids are the only people in the world that you're allowed to hit. Do you realize that? They're the most vulnerable, and they're the most destroyed by being hit, but it's totally okay to hit them. And they're the only ones. If you hit a dog, they fucking will put you in jail for that shit. You can't hit a person unless you can prove that they were trying to kill you. But a little, tiny person with a head this big, who trusts you implicitly, fuck 'em. Who gives a shit? Just fucking-- Let's all hit them. People want you to hit your kid. If your kid's making noise, they'll be like, \"Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! [Growls] Hit him!\" That's right. We're proud of it. We tell-- \"I hit my kids.\" That's what people say all the time. \"You're damn right I hit my kids.\" \"Why--why do you hit them?\" \"'Cause they were doing a thing I didn't like at the moment, \"And so I hit them, and guess what? They didn't do it after that.\" Well, that wouldn't be taking\n\nThe fucking easy way out, Would it? How about talking to 'em for a second, you fucking retard? How do you f-- How is that-- How is that the-- What are you, an idiot? What are you? A fucking ape? \"Well, I don't-- It's a pain in the ass.\" Well, you fucked a woman, and a fucking baby came out of her vagina. Now you be patient. It's not their fault. \"Well, I\u2019m teaching 'em that you hit things.\" \"It's learning the world. \"You hit him, and he'll know... \"That I\u2019m stronger than him, \"That it hurts when my hand Hits his face. \"He'll know. \"He'll get some wisdom Out of that. Raising 'em right.\" God damn it. Look, though, let me say this. If you have kids and you do hit your kids, I totally get it. I'm not judging. Let me just explain. I get it. Because my mom hit me. She hit me all the time. I don't hit my kids. I'm not better than my mom. It's 'cause she was poor and I have money. That's really all it is. It really is. My mom works really hard. She was a single mom. She'd come home all Bent over after 15 hours. I'd be like, \"mommy, Nyah nyah nyah.\" \"Shut up!\" I totally get that. I work two hours a week Sometimes, So it's not really fair, and I know that. I know there's moments When you just fucking-- I mean, they're-- Being a parent means you have Your back up against the wall All the time, Because it's the only job You can't quit. It's the only job where you can't just go-- Just put your wrench down and go, \"Fuck it, guys. I'm leaving. \"I don't even want my last check. I'm going home.\" Anyway, I got two. And the seven-year-old, She's no trouble now. That kid's amazing. She's better than me. She's smarter than me. She's more decent. She's cleaner. Like, she comes out of her room all dressed with a little bow. She's like, \"hi. Good morning, daddy.\" And I'm in my underwear, Like, \"uh, hi.\" I keep trying not to screw her up, because she's headed for a great life unless I fuck it up. That's basically what's going on. I'm not--I'm not a father anymore. I'm just a fat landlord. I don't really matter. Like, the other day, she was asking me all these questions. And I totally hear-- She's asking me stuff, and I'm just trying to tell her what i know to be the truth. But you can't just do that. There's some shit that's true that you can't tell your kids when they're certain ages. I know that sounds simple, But you don't know all the time until you fuck up. I'm talking to her, and she goes, \"Daddy, does the earth Go around the sun?\" And I was like, \"yeah.\" She goes, \"does it do it all the time?\" And I go, \"yeah.\" She says, \"will the earth always Go around the sun forever?\" And I was like, \"Well, no, at some point, the sun's gonna explode.\" She's seven years old. Do you understand how horrible that is? She started crying immediately. Crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity. And here's how I tried to save it. I go, \"oh, honey, this isn't gonna happen \"Until you and everybody you know has been dead for a very long time.\" She didn't know any of those things, and now she knows all of those things. She's gonna die. Everybody she knows is gonna to die. They're gonna be dead for a very long time, And then the sun's gonna explode. She learned all that In 12 seconds at the age of seven. She took it pretty well. I was proud of her. She's like, \"oh. Dude.\" [Breathes heavily] \"Okay, well... I guess I'll go play. I don't...\" She's had a tough year, that kid. I feel really bad. Lot of bad things happened to her this year. This summer, a pony bit her. I'm not kidding. A pony bit her. How do you more break A little girl's heart? Than a pony bi-- That's like being raped By Santa Claus. It was the worst thing that ever happened, and it was made worse by the fact that it followed the greatest Moment of her life, because she'd never seen a pony up close. We just never were fucking - Shitty parents. We never gave her, like, a pony ride. And last summer I took the kids to Italy. I took my girls to Italy for whatever reason. I don't know why. And we're in this farmhouse In the middle of nowhere. And I put 'em to bed, and I come outside, and there are ponies. They just showed up Out of nowhere. Just wild ponies. Like 50 ponies. I'm not fucking with you. A huge amount of ponies. And one donkey. I don't know why. There was one donkey Hanging out with the ponies. And they're just la-- And I'm like-- [Gasps] And I run downstairs, and I wake her up. The little one, fuck her. She's not making memories. Who cares? It's not worth it. I take the seven-year-old, and I bring her outside, and she's standing barefoot in her pajamas. And it's dusk, and it's ponies, and she's like-- [Gasps] and I'm like, \"I'm the best fucking father. \"I'm the best father. Yeah! \"Yeah! Look at that shit! That's right! I gave that to you!\" And she starts walking out towards the ponies. She's like, \"Can I go near them? I'm like, \"yeah.\" I'm an idiot. I'm like, \"yeah, totally. \"Go on out there, honey. \"You're only outnumbered \"What could possibly happen in a sea of wild ponies?\" And she walks out, And there's this one, Beautiful, speckled pony, And as she's Walking towards it, I'm an asshole, 'Cause I don't read-- It's going like-- [Snorts] It's totally going, \"Dude, [snorts] no. \"Not--I'm not one of-- Fuck it. \"Get her out. Get her out. \"I'm a- dude, I'm a fucking Italian wild pony. Get her out of here.\" Can I go, daddy? I'm like, \"yes, totally. Go up to the pony.\" She walks up to the pony, and she turns to me and says, \"He's beautiful.\" And as she's saying that, the pony bites her on the fucking leg. And she screams. It didn't break the skin, but it was an awful bruise. And I grab her and I run inside. And she says, \"why, daddy? Why did the pony bite me?\" And I said, \"i don't know.\" And she said, \"Do ponies bite a lot?\" And I\u2019m like, \"well, yeah,\" 'Cause i don't want her to think that she's so horrible that the first pony ever Bit her. I go, \"yeah, honey, Ponies bite,\" And she goes, \"well, why did you let me near it?\" She's like, \"dude, Make a fucking effort.\" And then we're in the house, and she says-- This is how great this kid is. She calms down, and she goes, \"I want to look up about ponies biting.\" Like, that's how she thinks. Something upsets her, She wants to look it up And learn about it. She says, \"I want to find out why they bite and what people say about it.\" So we go and we do look up about ponies, and it turns Out they're assholes. They bite all the time. And there's all these websites that talk about what to do when your pony bites, and it's like everything else on the Internet. It's just fighting. Just people angry at each other. The first guy says, \"You got to punch the pony Right in the face.\" Just punch it Right in the face. Then the next person says, \"You're a terrible person. You should have your ponies Taken away from you.\" The next person was my favorite. They go, \"people who don't punch their ponies make me sick.\" So we really are a divided nation. The three-year-old is a different story. The three year-old, Here's her deal. She's a three-year-old. That's really it. She's three years old. The other day I got in a fight with her. Whose fault is that? I'm 41, and she's 3. It's always your fault with a three-year-old. Always. Because they are just what they are. They can't help it. Just tape the windows. It's a fucking hurricane. Just wait. Anytime you're like this with a three-year-old-- \"Don't you under--\" You're an idiot. That's you being an idiot. \"Don't you understand?\" \"No, i don't, dad. I haven't developed enough. You just have to wait.\" But it was partly her fault, 'Cause she wore me down. Let me tell you what happened. It was this horrible, horrible day. It started the night before, 'Cause she woke me up all night. Just woke me up every fucking-- Just ten minutes. Just woke me up-- Just-- \"Dad.\" With nothing. That's the worst part. \"Daddy!\" \"Wha--what? What is it?\" \"Um...\" \"Oh, fuck you. You got nothing. You bullshitter, you.\" So now it's the next morning, I'm making breakfast, and I\u2019m gone. I'm insane. I drank too much coffee to overcompensate, and I\u2019m like\u2014I keep having these moments where it's like-- And there's nothing there. Just nothing. \"Uh, okay. Jesus.\" I'm making French toast. She's over there Sitting in her little chair, just fucking anger. Just pure--she's A little ball of anger. She's like, \"I want French toast!\" I'm like, \"yeah, that's what I\u2019m making, honey. I'm making French toast.\" I bring it over. \"Here.\" \"Give me syrup!\" \"Yes. Of course. I'll give you syrup. I always do. I love you very much.\" \"Cut it for me!\" \"I'm happy to cut it for you. \"You're not asking nicely, but it's okay. \"I'll cut it for you, Baby. I love you very much.\" Then she's looking at her plate, and she's literally going-- [Breathing heavily] 'Cause she needs to be-- Want something. You know, she didn't-- There's nothing logical for her to want, so her brain has to go somewhere crazy. So she's looking at her plate. She goes, \"i don't know which piece to eat!\" And I\u2019m still not engaging. I'm like, \"Oh, i know, honey. \"That's hard. That's really hard. \"I'll just make a list of pros and cons for every piece, and I\u2019ll help you with it later.\" And i look at her, and she's walking towards me now with the plate just vertical, with syrup fucking Going on the floor. She's like, \"Help me! You're not helping!\" And I\u2019m standing there, Like, looking at her, And i love her, And I\u2019m proud of her in a way, 'Cause I know she'll never Want for anything. She'll beat the shit Out of people. She's... She'll kill people for meat after the apocalypse. She'll be one of those. And then later I\u2019m trying to get them dressed for school, and now the clock's ticking, and I\u2019m like, \"uh...\" And I\u2019m trying to put a sweater on her, and it's impossible. The sweater has buttons that just don't exist. And I\u2019m fucking-- My fat fingers, and they're full of sweat. And i have just tears Going down my cheeks. Crazy tears. I'm not crying. I'm, like, smiling with tears. Copious-- \"I can't-- I can't put on the sweater. \"I can't put on the sweater. I can't. I really can't do it.\" And she's going like this. So i give her a fig newton Just to immobilize her, Just to stop it. 'Cause she loves Fig Newtons. I go, \"here, honey. Have a fig newton.\" She goes, \"they're not called fig newtons. They're called pig newtons.\" And i go, \"No, they're not. They're called fig newtons.\" And right away in my head I'm like, \"what are you doing? \"Why? What is to be gained? What do you care?\" Just--\"yeah, pig newtons. Fine. Go ahead. \"Good luck to you. Go through life. \"See what kind of job you can hold down \"With shit like that Clanging around in your head. I don't care. I'll be dead.\" But for some reason I engaged. \"No, honey, they're called Fig Newtons.\" She goes, \"No. You don't know. You don't know. They're called pig newtons.\" And i just--i feel this rage Building inside. Just... Because it's not that she's wrong. She's three. She's entitled to be wrong. But it's the fucking arrogance of this kid. No humility. No decent sense of self-doubt. She's not going like, \"dad, I think those are pig newtons. Are you sure that you have it right?\" She's not saying that. She's not going, like, \"Dad, i'm pretty sure those are pig newtons,\" Which would be a little Cunty, but acceptable. I could deal with that. She's giving me nothing. \"No, you don't know. Those are pig--\" I'm like, \"Really? I don't know? \"I don't know? \"Dude, I\u2019m not even using my memory right now, okay? \"I'm reading the fucking box \"That the shit came out of! \"It says it! Where are you getting your information?\" \"How do you fuck with me on this? \"You're 3 and I\u2019m 41! \"What are the odds that you're right and I\u2019m wrong? \"What are the sheer odds of that? \"And take a bite of the cookie. \"Does it taste like A pork cookie, motherfucker? \"I don't think so. Why would they call it a pig newton?\" \"What's-- Oh, it tastes like figs. Fucking interesting, that, isn't it?\" I didn't say a word of that. Obviously. But anyway, later... Got the kids dressed. It's winter. We all have the layers on, and it's time to go to school. And I\u2019ve got ten minutes To get to a school That's ten minutes away, Which is a horrible feeling. I put my hand on the door to leave, and all of a sudden i go, \"I got to take a shit. \"Take the coats off, kids. \"We're gonna be late. \"You're gonna be I don't give a shit.\" I am not walking to school like this. I can't use the bathroom at the school, 'Cause child molesters ruined that for everybody. Just--we're-- I'm shitting here. So I\u2019m sitting on the toilet. I'm shitting. With the door open, by the way. That's my life. Two kids by myself. I can't shit with the door closed. Unless i gather them into the bathroom to watch daddy take a dump. Which I\u2019ve done with the little one. \"Honey, uh, i got to poop and you're too crazy. Just come with me. You got to come with me.\" So I\u2019m sitting there, And I\u2019m shitting, And I\u2019m trying to see them In the other room. \"Honey, Stay between the tables. I can't see you,\" I said. The little one Walks into view naked. It's all gone. All gone. Walks up, looks at me. And then she-- I don't know why, But she shows me her ass. It's something She always does when she's-- She just goes-- \"Look at it! Daddy, You're not looking!\" So I\u2019m sitting there shitting, looking at her ass. [Clears throat] And i saw something that I\u2019d never seen before. And I\u2019m gonna describe it to you The way that i saw it, Because it just--i didn't know What i was looking at. I'm looking at her little, White ass. She's white. Little, perfect, little, white ass. And right in the center of it, this little black dot Just--boop! Appeared like magic. That's what it Looked like to me, Because I\u2019ve never Seen shit Actually coming out of an ass before. I never saw that. I never saw the shit-- Like, the crowning, the shit coming out. And if you ever do see that, its fucking bananas, man. It's weird. And upsetting. I yelled. I went, \"aah!\" And a second later, just-- She just drops this massive\u2014I felt the impact tremor under my feet. This huge pile of shit. Just a pile. Like several people's Pile of shit. Like a port-a-potty on the last day of the festival. Just a huge, huge pile of shit. How? She's three. This kid shits like a bear. I don't understand it. Seriously. If you were in the woods and you saw a shit like that, you'd be like, \"let's get the fuck out of here! Run!\" Huge pile of shit. As big as her whole body. Easily. I thought she would just crumple like a balloon on top of it. \"Huh. Weird.\" She's standing there just straddling this huge shit, presenting it, like... She slips, falls Right into her own shit. Yes, fell-- I was there. Fell right in the middle of her own heap of shit. Her head hit the floor. You know that sound of your Kid's head hitting the floor? [Smacks stool] \"Ooh. Oh, God. \"Uh, she's done. \"That's it for her. She's finished. \"She's gonna be running to the mailbox once a day. That's about it for her.\" Now she's laying in her shit, Screaming and crying and making an angel. I run over. I'm still shitting, holding a Shit-covered child. We're the shit family. That's what we are. The seven-year-old's standing there, \"I got to get the fuck out of here. This is horrible.\" That's my life right now, Man. That's--like, where in there Do i fit, like, getting pussy? Like, there's no place for that. I can't even think about it. I tried to, like-- The other day i was, like, Okay, take a sexual Inventory here. What do you got left, you know? And i went-- I took off my clothes, and i stood in the mirror, and i looked in the mirror, like, a full-length mirror, Naked. I'll never do that again. I don't need-- I don't need to do it. I can go my whole life without doing it again. I'm going to. I'm not in good shape. I'm not in the worst shape. I mean, I went to a doctor, and he gave me the whole He's like, \"all right, well, your cholesterol is high, \"But i don't expect you to do anything about that. \"And your prostate's A little bit too big. \"Let's go ahead and let it be a little too big. And you're only Cosmetically overweight.\" I was like, \"what?\" He goes, \"Your overweightness, It's not a medical issue.\" I'm like, \"well, so then you didn't have to say anything. Why\u2014why did you even bring it up?\" You're just saying, like, \"Well, medically speaking, you don't have a weight problem, but you look gross.\" That's what he's saying. I'm looking at myself, and here's the problem, is that i didn't even wear down evenly. Like, different parts of my body are older than others. Like, my dick and balls don\u2019t even match each other. Like, my balls are older than me. They're, like, the old-- I swear to God. I'm 41. My balls are, like, 72. They're really old, and they Just kind of hang there. They're just hanging, like... They look like a helicopter from a mountain is rescuing them. [Imitates helicopter] They've been trapped on a mountain together. Zipped together in a sleeping bag. [Shuddering] \"If we ever get out of this, I'll never call you lefty again. I'm sorry.\" And then my dick is, like, Happy and shiny and young looking. My penis is, like, a young, walking down with these two old guys following him. Hey, man, hang back. I'm trying to get some pussy. Get out of here. [Elderly voice] \"Wait for us.\" And at some point, I got to show this shit to some poor, unfortunate woman that has to see this Fucked up package of mine. I don't know what-- Like, I\u2019ll tuck my balls between my legs. \"I don't have balls. I just have a penis. Is that okay?\" That must be weird for women, That you don't know what kind of Dick and balls you're gonna get Until it's way too late. Like, it's the last Thing you see. And it doesn't seem fair. It should be the first Thing you see. Every date should start with a guy taking out-- \"Is this gonna be okay?\" \"Yeah, that's fine. It's gonna be worth my time. Go ahead and put it away. We'll deal with it later.\" 'Cause you don't-- You don't find out till you're looking down the barrel of it, and it's really too late now. Like, \"oh, Jesus.\" And the dick's Looking up at you, and it's all... Like, \"this is, like, a Dr. Seuss tree. \"I don't even-- It's all yellowy brown with sprigs coming out.\" And women are so nice. I don't know a single story of a woman who finally gets a guy's dick out and goes, \"No. That--no. \"That's not your dick. Come on! \"Take out your penis. \"That's not a penis. That's bullshit.\" They just go, \"okay. Oh, fuck. What hole can i put this in that'll depress me the least?\" And i have-- I have met some women Since i been single, And they've been younger, Mostly, Because women my age-- I like women my age, But they're mostly either Married with children Or in a room alone, Angry and crazy. One or the other. They're not out looking to fuck a comic, generally. But young women are up for something. They'll fuck you and do other things later. Like... And also, with younger women, I'm in competition with younger guys, and younger guys are not very subtle. They don't really know How to talk to a woman Even their own age. They're just kind of all-- Like, penis skin's been grafted on their whole body. They're just-- [Mutters] \"Can i--is this... \"Is this is a fuck date? 'Cause i... I just want to put my come in your body.\" It's just a lot of pressure. And then the young woman meets me, And I\u2019m like, \"hey, look, \"I've been jerking off in the guest room for 15 years. \"I'm like the man in the iron mask. I'm just happy to be out.\" Young guys are-- They're afraid of women. They're afraid of their feelings. \"My girlfriend's mad at me!\" Well, later she won't be. Fucking calm down. They're afraid of their bodies. They're afraid of women's bodies. \"My girlfriend's having Her period. What do i do?\" Fuck her in the period hole, you idiot. What is--what's the dilemma? I don't give a shit. If you're having your period, Come on over. I'm 41. I'm--I\u2019ll fuck the shit out of you. I'll drink the blood. Let's party. Thank you very much, guys.

Of the Expense of Defence\n\nThe first duty of the sovereign, that of protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies, can be performed only by means of a military force. But the expense both of preparing this military force in time of peace, and of employing it in time of war, is very different in the different states of society, in the different periods of improvement.\nAmong nations of hunters, the lowest and rudest state of society, such as we find it among the native tribes of North America, every man is a warrior, as well as a hunter. When he goes to war, either to defend his society, or to revenge the injuries which have been done to it by other societies, he maintains himself by his own labour, in the same manner as when he lives at home. His society (for in this state of things there is properly neither sovereign nor commonwealth) is at no sort of expense, either to prepare him for the field, or to maintain him while he is in it.\n\nAmong nations of shepherds, a more advanced state of society, such as we find it among the Tartars and Arabs, every man is, in the same manner, a warrior. Such nations have commonly no fixed habitation, but live either in tents, or in a sort of covered waggons, which are easily transported from place to place. The whole tribe, or nation, changes its situation according to the different seasons of the year, as well as according to other accidents. When its herds and flocks have consumed the forage of one part of the country, it removes to another, and from that to a third. In the dry season, it comes down to the banks of the rivers; in the wet season, it retires to the upper country. When such a nation goes to war, the warriors will not trust their herds and flocks to the feeble defence of their old men, their women and children; and their old men, their women and children, will not be left behind without defence, and without subsistence. The whole nation, besides, being accustomed to a wandering life, even in time of peace, easily takes the field in time of war. Whether it marches as an army, or moves about as a company of herdsmen, the way of life is nearly the same, though the object proposed by it be very different. They all go to war together, therefore, and everyone does as well as he can. Among the Tartars, even the women have been frequently known to engage in battle. If they conquer, whatever belongs to the hostile tribe is the recompence of the victory; but if they are vanquished, all is lost; and not only their herds and flocks, but their women and children become the booty of the conqueror. Even the greater part of those who survive the action are obliged to submit to him for the sake of immediate subsistence. The rest are commonly dissipated and dispersed in the desert.\n\nThe ordinary life, the ordinary exercise of a Tartar or Arab, prepares him sufficiently for war. Running, wrestling, cudgel-playing, throwing the javelin, drawing the bow, etc. are the common pastimes of those who live in the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or Arab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks, which he carries with him, in the same manner as in peace. His chief or sovereign (for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns) is at no sort of expense in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it, the chance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or requires.\n\nAn army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men. The precarious subsistence which the chace affords, could seldom allow a greater number to keep together for any considerable time. An army of shepherds, on the contrary, may sometimes amount to two or three hundred thousand. As long as nothing stops their progress, as long as they can go on from one district, of which they have consumed the forage, to another, which is yet entire; there seems to be scarce any limit to the number who can march on together. A nation of hunters can never be formidable to the civilized nations in their neighbourhood; a nation of shepherds may. Nothing can be more contemptible than an Indian war in North America; nothing, on the contrary, can be more dreadful than a Tartar invasion has frequently been in Asia. The judgment of Thucydides, that both Europe and Asia could not resist the Scythians united, has been verified by the experience of all ages. The inhabitants of the extensive, but defenceless plains of Scythia or Tartary, have been frequently united under the dominion of the chief of some conquering horde or clan; and the havock and devastation of Asia have always signalized their union. The inhabitants of the inhospitable deserts of Arabia, the other great nation of shepherds, have never been united but once, under Mahomet and his immediate successors. Their union, which was more the effect of religious enthusiasm than of conquest, was signalized in the same manner. If the hunting nations of America should ever become shepherds, their neighbourhood would be much more dangerous to the European colonies than it is at present.\nIn a yet more advanced state of society, among those nations of husbandmen who have little foreign commerce, and no other manufactures but those coarse and household ones, which almost every private family prepares for its own use, every man, in the same manner, either is a warrior, or easily becomes such. Those who live by agriculture generally pass the whole day in the open air, exposed to all the inclemencies of the seasons. The hardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war, to some of which their necessary occupations bear a great analogy. The necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the trenches, and to fortify a camp, as well as to inclose a field. The ordinary pastimes of such husbandmen are the same as those of shepherds, and are in the same manner the images of war. But as husbandmen have less leisure than shepherds, they are not so frequently employed in those pastimes. They are soldiers but soldiers not quite so much masters of their exercise. Such as they are, however, it seldom costs the sovereign or commonwealth any expense to prepare them for the field.\n\nAgriculture, even in its rudest and lowest state, supposes a settlement, some sort of fixed habitation, which cannot be abandoned without great loss. When a nation of mere husbandmen, therefore, goes to war, the whole people cannot take the field together. The old men, the women and children, at least, must remain at home, to take care of the habitation. All the men of the military age, however, may take the field, and in small nations of this kind, have frequently done so. In every nation, the men of the military age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people. If the campaign, too, should begin after seedtime, and end before harvest, both the husbandman and his principal labourers can be spared from the farm without much loss. He trusts that the work which must be done in the mean time, can be well enough executed by the old men, the women, and the children. He is not unwilling, therefore, to serve without pay during a short campaign; and it frequently costs the sovereign or commonwealth as little to maintain him in the field as to prepare him for it. The citizens of all the different states of ancient Greece seem to have served in this manner till after the second Persian war; and the people of Peloponnesus till after the Peloponnesian war. The Peloponnesians, Thucydides observes, generally left the field in the summer, and returned home to reap the harvest. The Roman people, under their kings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same manner. It was not till the seige of Veii, that they who staid at home began to contribute something towards maintaining those who went to war. In the European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, both before, and for some time after, the establishment of what is properly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their immediate dependents, used to serve the crown at their own expense. In the field, in the same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by their own revenue, and not by any stipend or pay which they received from the king upon that particular occasion.\nIn a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute to render it altogether impossible that they who take the field should maintain themselves at their own expense. Those two causes are, the progress of manufactures, and the improvement in the art of war.\n\nThough a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided it begins after seedtime, and ends before harvest, the interruption of his business will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his revenue. Without the intervention of his labour, Nature does herself the greater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that an artificer, a smith, a carpenter, or a weaver, for example, quits his workhouse, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature does nothing for him; he does all for himself. When he takes the field, therefore, in defence of the public, as he has no revenue to maintain himself, he must necessarily be maintained by the public. But in a country, of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and manufacturers, a great part of the people who go to war must be drawn from those classes, and must, therefore, be maintained by the public as long as they are employed in its service.\n\nWhen the art of war, too, has gradually grown up to be a very intricate and complicated science; when the event of war ceases to be determined, as in the first ages of society, by a single irregular skirmish or battle; but when the contest is generally spun out through several different campaigns, each of which lasts during the greater part of the year; it becomes universally necessary that the public should maintain those who serve the public in war, at least while they are employed in that service. Whatever, in time of peace, might be the ordinary occupation of those who go to war, so very tedious and expensive a service would otherwise be by far too heavy a burden upon them. After the second Persian war, accordingly, the armies of Athens seem to have been generally composed of mercenary troops, consisting, indeed, partly of citizens, but partly, too, of foreigners; and all of them equally hired and paid at the expense of the state. From the time of the siege of Veii, the armies of Rome received pay for their service during the time which they remained in the field. Under the feudal governments, the military service, both of the great lords, and of their immediate dependents, was, after a certain period, universally exchanged for a payment in money, which was employed to maintain those who served in their stead.\n\nThe number of those who can go to war, in proportion to the whole number of the people, is necessarily much smaller in a civilized than in a rude state of society. In a civilized society, as the soldiers are maintained altogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of the former can never exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above maintaining, in a manner suitable to their respective stations, both themselves and the other officers of government and law, whom they are obliged to maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a fourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people considered the themselves as soldiers, and would sometimes, it is said, take the field. Among the civilized nations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed, that not more than the one hundredth part of the inhabitants of any country can be employed as soldiers, without ruin to the country which pays the expense of their service.\n\nThe expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have become considerable in any nation, till long after that of maintaining it in the field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth. In all the different republics of ancient Greece, to learn his military exercises, was a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free citizen. In every city there seems to have been a public field, in which, under the protection of the public magistrate, the young people were taught their different exercises by different masters. In this very simple institution consisted the whole expense which any Grecian state seems ever to have been at, in preparing its citizens for war. In ancient Rome, the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose with those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the many public ordinances, that the citizens of every district should practise archery, as well as several other military exercises, were intended for promoting the same purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well. Either from want of interest in the officers entrusted with the execution of those ordinances, or from some other cause, they appear to have been universally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments, military exercises seem to have gone gradually into disuse among the great body of the people.\n\nIn the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole period of their existence, and under the feudal governments, for a considerable time after their first establishment, the trade of a soldier was not a separate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of citizens; every subject of the state, whatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by which he gained his livelihood, considered himself, upon all ordinary occasions, as fit likewise to exercise the trade of a soldier, and, upon many extraordinary occasions, as bound to exercise it.\n\nThe art of war, however, as it is certainly the noblest of all arts, so, in the progress of improvement, it necessarily becomes one of the most complicated among them. The state of the mechanical, as well as some other arts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the degree of perfection to which it is capable of being carried at any particular time. But in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is necessary that it should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of citizens; and the division of labour is as necessary for the improvement of this, as of every other art. Into other arts, the division of labour is naturally introduced by the prudence of individuals, who find that they promote their private interest better by confining themselves to a particular trade, than by exercising a great number. But it is the wisdom of the state only, which can render the trade of a soldier a particular trade, separate and distinct from all others. A private citizen, who, in time of profound peace, and without any particular encouragement from the public, should spend the greater part of his time in military exercises, might, no doubt, both improve himself very much in them, and amuse himself very well; but he certainly would not promote his own interest. It is the wisdom of the state only, which can render it for his interest to give up the greater part of his time to this peculiar occupation; and states have not always had this wisdom, even when their circumstances had become such, that the preservation of their existence required that they should have it.\n\nA shepherd has a great deal of leisure; a husbandman, in the rude state of husbandry, has some; an artificer or manufacturer has none at all. The first may, without any loss, employ a great deal of his time in martial exercises; the second may employ some part of it; but the last cannot employ a single hour in them without some loss, and his attention to his own interest naturally leads him to neglect them altogether. Those improvements in husbandry, too, which the progress of arts and manufactures necessarily introduces, leave the husbandman as little leisure as the artificer. Military exercises come to be as much neglected by the inhabitants of the country as by those of the town, and the great body of the people becomes altogether unwarlike. That wealth, at the same time, which always follows the improvements of agriculture and manufactures, and which, in reality, is no more than the accumulated produce of those improvements, provokes the invasion of all their neighbours. An industrious, and, upon that account, a wealthy nation, is of all nations the most likely to be attacked; and unless the state takes some new measure for the public defence, the natural habits of the people render them altogether incapable of defending themselves.\nIn these circumstances, there seem to be but two methods by which the state can make any tolerable provision for the public defence.\n\nIt may either, first, by means of a very rigorous police, and in spite of the whole bent of the interest, genius, and inclinations of the people, enforce the practice of military exercises, and oblige either all the citizens of the military age, or a certain number of them, to join in some measure the trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or profession they may happen to carry on.\n\nOr, secondly, by maintaining and employing a certain number of citizens in the constant practice of military exercises, it may render the trade of a soldier a particular trade, separate and distinct from all others.\nIf the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients, its military force is said to consist in a militia; if to the second, it is said to consist in a standing army. The practice of military exercises is the sole or principal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army, and the maintenance or pay which the state affords them is the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence. The practice of military exercises is only the occasional occupation of the soldiers of a militia, and they derive the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence from some other occupation. In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier; in a standing army, that of the soldier predominates over every other character; and in this distinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two different species of military force.\n\nMilitias have been of several different kinds. In some countries, the citizens destined for defending the state seem to have been exercised only, without being, if I may say so, regimented; that is, without being divided into separate and distinct bodies of troops, each of which performed its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers. In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as long as he remained at home, seems to have practised his exercises, either separately and independently, or with such of his equals as he liked best; and not to have been attached to any particular body of troops, till he was actually called upon to take the field. In other countries, the militia has not only been exercised, but regimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I believe, in every other country of modern Europe, where any imperfect military force of this kind has been established, every militiaman is, even in time of peace, attached to a particular body of troops, which performs its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers.\nBefore the invention of fire-arms, that army was superior in which the soldiers had, each individually, the greatest skill and dexterity in the use of their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highest consequence, and commonly determined the fate of battles. But this skill and dexterity in the use of their arms could be acquired only, in the same manner as fencing is at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but each man separately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or with his own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of fire-arms, strength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity and skill in the use of arms, though they are far from being of no consequence, are, however, of less consequence. The nature of the weapon, though it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful, puts him more nearly so than he ever was before. All the dexterity and skill, it is supposed, which are necessary for using it, can be well enough acquired by practising in great bodies.\n\nRegularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, are qualities which, in modern armies, are of more importance towards determining the fate of battles, than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of their arms. But the noise of fire-arms, the smoke, and the invisible death to which every man feels himself every moment exposed, as soon as he comes within cannon-shot, and frequently a long time before the battle can be well said to be engaged, must render it very difficult to maintain any considerable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience, even in the beginning of a modern battle. In an ancient battle, there was no noise but what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there was no invisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal weapon actually did approach him, saw clearly that no such weapon was near him. In these circumstances, and among troops who had some confidence in their own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it must have been a good deal less difficult to preserve some degree of regularity and order, not only in the beginning, but through the whole progress of an ancient battle, and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits of regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, can be acquired only by troops which are exercised in great bodies.\nA militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or exercised, must always be much inferior to a well disciplined and well exercised standing army.\n\nThe soldiers who are exercised only once a week, or once a-month, can never be so expert in the use of their arms, as those who are exercised every day, or every other day; and though this circumstance may not be of so much consequence in modern, as it was in ancient times, yet the acknowledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, it is said, very much to their superior expertness in their exercise, may satisfy us that it is, even at this day, of very considerable consequence.\nThe soldiers, who are bound to obey their officer only once a-week, or once a-month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their own affairs their own way, without being, in any respect, accountable to him, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can never have the same disposition to ready obedience, with those whose whole life and conduct are every day directed by him, and who every day even rise and go to bed, or at least retire to their quarters, according to his orders. In what is called discipline, or in the habit of ready obedience, a militia must always be still more inferior to a standing army, than it may sometimes be in what is called the manual exercise, or in the management and use of its arms. But, in modern war, the habit of ready and instant obedience is of much greater consequence than a considerable superiority in the management of arms.\n\nThose militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under the same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace, are by far the best. In respect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, they approach nearest to standing armies. The Highland militia, when it served under its own chieftains, had some advantage of the same kind. As the Highlanders, however, were not wandering, but stationary shepherds, as they had all a fixed habitation, and were not, in peaceable times, accustomed to follow their chieftain from place to place; so, in time of war, they were less willing to follow him to any considerable distance, or to continue for any long time in the field. When they had acquired any booty, they were eager to return home, and his authority was seldom sufficient to detain them. In point of obedience, they were always much inferior to what is reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the Highlanders, too, from their stationary life, spend less of their time in the open air, they were always less accustomed to military exercises, and were less expert in the use of their arms than the Tartars and Arabs are said to be.\n\nA militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has served for several successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every respect a standing army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their arms, and, being constantly under the command of their officers, are habituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing armies. What they were before they took the field, is of little importance. They necessarily become in every respect a standing army, after they have passed a few campaigns in it. Should the war in America drag out through another campaign, the American militia may become, in every respect, a match for that standing army, of which the valour appeared, in the last war at least, not inferior to that of the hardiest veterans of France and Spain.\n\nThis distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will be found, hears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well regulated standing army has over a militia.\n\nOne of the first standing armies, of which we have any distinct account in any well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His frequent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of the Greek cities in the neighbourhood of Macedon, gradually formed his troops, which in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact discipline of a standing army. When he was at peace, which he was very seldom, and never for any long time together, he was careful not to disband that army. It vanquished and subdued, after a long and violent struggle, indeed, the gallant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient Greece; and afterwards, with very little struggle, the effeminate and ill exercised militia of the great Persian empire. The fall of the Greek republics, and of the Persian empire was the effect of the irresistible superiority which a standing arm has over every other sort of militia. It is the first great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which history has preserved any distinct and circumstantial account.\n\nThe fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the second. All the varieties in the fortune of those two famous republics may very well be accounted for from the same cause.\n\nFrom the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian war, the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed under three great generals, who succeeded one another in the command; Amilcar, his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Annibal: first in chastising their own rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the revolted nations of Africa; and lastly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain. The army which Annibal led from Spain into Italy must necessarily, in those different wars, have been gradually formed to the exact discipline of a standing army. The Romans, in the meantime, though they had not been altogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in any war of very great consequence; and their military discipline, it is generally said, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Annibal encountered at Trebi, Thrasymenus, and Cannae, were militia opposed to a standing army. This circumstance, it is probable, contributed more than any other to determine the fate of those battles.\n\nThe standing army which Annibal left behind him in Spain had the like superiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it; and, in a few years, under the command of his brother, the younger Asdrubal, expelled them almost entirely from that country.\n\nAnnibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being continually in the field, became, in the progress of the war, a well disciplined and well exercised standing army; and the superiority of Annibal grew every day less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole, or almost the whole, of the standing army which he commanded in Spain, to the assistance of his brother in Italy. In this march, he is said to have been misled by his guides; and in a country which he did not know, was surprised and attacked, by another standing army, in every respect equal or superior to his own, and was entirely defeated.\nWhen Asdrubal had left Spain, the great Scipio found nothing to oppose him but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued that militia, and, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily became a well disciplined and well exercised standing army. That standing army was afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to oppose it. In order to defend Carthage, it became necessary to recal the standing army of Annibal. The disheartened and frequently defeated African militia joined it, and, at the battle of Zama, composed the greater part of the troops of Annibal. The event of that day determined the fate of the two rival republics.\n\nFrom the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the Roman republic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing armies. The standing army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms. In the height of their grandeur, it cost them two great wars, and three great battles, to subdue that little kingdom, of which the conquest would probably have been still more difficult, had it not been for the cowardice of its last king. The militias of all the civilized nations of the ancient world, of Greece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble resistance to the standing armies of Rome. The militias of some barbarous nations defended themselves much better. The Scythian or Tartar militia, which Mithridates drew from the countries north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, were the most formidable enemies whom the Romans had to encounter after the second Carthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias, too, were always respectable, and upon several occasions, gained very considerable advantages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when the Roman armies were well commanded, they appear to have been very much superior; and if the Romans did not pursue the final conquest either of Parthia or Germany, it was probably because they judged that it was not worth while to add those two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too large. The ancient Parthians appear to have been a nation of Scythian or Tartar extraction, and to have always retained a good deal of the manners of their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like the Scythians or Tartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to war under the same chiefs whom they were accustomed to follow in peace. 'Their militia was exactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or Tartars, from whom, too, they were probably descended.\n\nMany different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the Roman armies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the days of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them, their heavy armour was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome, their laborious exercises were neglected, as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the Roman emperors, besides, the standing armies of Rome, those particularly which guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to their masters, against whom they used frequently to set up their own generals. In order to render them less formidable, according to some authors, Dioclesian, according to others, Constantine, first withdrew them from the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in great bodies, generally of two or three legions each, and dispersed them in small bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence they were scarce ever removed, but when it became necessary to repel an invasion. Small bodies of soldiers, quartered in trading and manufacturing towns, and seldom removed from those quarters, became themselves trades men, artificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to predominate over the military character; and the standing armies of Rome gradually degenerated into a corrupt, neglected, and undisciplined militia, incapable of resisting the attack of the German and Scythian militias, which soon afterwards invaded the western empire. It was only by hiring the militia of some of those nations to oppose to that of others, that the emperors were for some time able to defend themselves. The fall of the western empire is the third great revolution in the affairs of mankind, of which ancient history has preserved any distinct or circumstantial account. It was brought about by the irresistible superiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation; which the militia of a nation of shepherds has over that of a nation of husbandmen, artificers, and manufacturers. The victories which have been gained by militias have generally been, not over standing armies, but over other militias, in exercise and discipline inferior to themselves. Such were the victories which the Greek militia gained over that of the Persian empire; and such, too, were those which, in later times, the Swiss militia gained over that of the Austrians and Burgundians.\n\nThe military force of the German and Scythian nations, who established themselves upon ruins of the western empire, continued for some time to be of the same kind in their new settlements, as it had been in their original country. It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen, which, in time of war, took the field under the command of the same chieftains whom it was accustomed to obey in peace. It was, therefore, tolerably well exercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and industry advanced, however, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great body of the people had less time to spare for military exercises. Both the discipline and the exercise of the feudal militia, therefore, went gradually to ruin, and standing armies were gradually introduced to supply the place of it. When the expedient of a standing army, besides, had once been adopted by one civilized nation, it became necessary that all its neighbours should follow the example. They soon found that their safety depended upon their doing so, and that their own militia was altogether incapable of resisting the attack of such an army.\n\nThe soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen an enemy, yet have frequently appeared to possess all the courage of veteran troops, and, the very moment that they took the field, to have been fit to face the hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Russian army marched into Poland, the valour of the Russian soldiers did not appear inferior to that of the Prussians, at that time supposed to be the hardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The Russian empire, however, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and could at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy. When the Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a profound peace for about eight-and-twenty years. The valour of her soldiers, however, far from being corrupted by that long peace, was never more distinguished than in the attempt upon Carthagena, the first unfortunate exploit of that unfortunate war. In a long peace, the generals, perhaps, may sometimes forget their skill; but where a well regulated standing army has been kept up, the soldiers seem never to forget their valour.\n\nWhen a civilized nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at all times exposed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to be in its neighbourhood. The frequent conquests of all the civilized countries in Asia by the Tartars, sufficiently demonstrates the natural superiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation. A well regulated standing army is superior to every militia. Such an army, as it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilized nation, so it can alone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and barbarous neighbour. It is only by means of a standing army, therefore, that the civilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even preserved, for any considerable time.\nAs it is only by means of a well regulated standing army, that a civilized country can be defended, so it is only by means of it that a barbarous country can be suddenly and tolerably civilized. A standing army establishes, with an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign through the remotest provinces of the empire, and maintains some degree of regular government in countries which could not otherwise admit of any. Whoever examines with attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced into the Russian empire, will find that they almost all resolve themselves into the establishment of a well regulated standing army. It is the instrument which executes and maintains all his other regulations. That degree of order and internal peace, which that empire has ever since enjoyed, is altogether owing to the influence of that army.\n\nMen of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army, as dangerous to liberty. It certainly is so, wherever the interest of the general, and that of the principal officers, are not necessarily connected with the support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of Caesar destroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwell turned the long parliament out of doors. But where the sovereign is himself the general, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief officers of the army; where the military force is placed under the command of those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil authority, because they have themselves the greatest share of that authority, a standing army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the contrary, it may, in some cases, be favourable to liberty. The security which it gives to the sovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome jealousy, which, in some modern republics, seems to watch over the minutest actions, and to be at all times ready to disturb the peace of every citizen. Where the security of the magistrate, though supported by the principal people of the country, is endangered by every popular discontent; where a small tumult is capable of bringing about in a few hours a great revolution, the whole authority of government must be employed to suppress and punish every murmur and complaint against it. To a sovereign, on the contrary, who feels himself supported, not only by the natural aristocracy of the country, but by a well regulated standing army, the rudest, the most groundless, and the most licentious remonstrances, can give little disturbance. He can safely pardon or neglect them, and his consciousness of his own superiority naturally disposes him to do so. That degree of liberty which approaches to licentiousness, can be tolerated only in countries where the sovereign is secured by a well regulated standing army. It is in such countries only, that the public safety does not require that the sovereign should be trusted with any discretionary power, for suppressing even the impertinent wantonness of this licentious liberty.\n\nThe first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the society from the violence and injustice of other independent societies, grows gradually more and more expensive, as the society advances in civilization. The military force of the society, which originally cost the sovereign no expense, either in time of peace, or in time of war, must, in the progress of improvement, first be maintained by him in time of war, and afterwards even in time of peace.\n\nThe great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of fire-arms, has enhanced still further both the expense of exercising and disciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and that of employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition are become more expensive. A musket is a more expensive machine than a javelin or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar, than a balista or a catapulta. The powder which is spent in a modern review is lost irrecoverably, and occasions a very considerable expense. The javelins and arrows which were thrown or shot in an ancient one, could easily be picked up again, and were, besides, of very little value. The cannon and the mortar are not only much dearer, but much heavier machines than the balista or catapulta; and require a greater expense, not only to prepare them for the field, but to carry them to it. As the superiority of the modern artillery, too, over that of the ancients, is very great; it has become much more difficult, and consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town, so as to resist, even for a few weeks, the attack of that superior artillery. In modern times, many different causes contribute to render the defence of the society more expensive. The unavoidable effects of the natural progress of improvement have, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great revolution in the art of war, to which a mere accident, the invention of gunpowder, seems to have given occasion.\nIn modern war, the great expense of firearms gives an evident advantage to the nation which can best afford that expense; and, consequently, to an opulent and civilized, over a poor and barbarous nation. In ancient times, the opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves against the poor and barbarous nations. In modern times, the poor and barbarous find it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilized. The invention of fire-arms, an invention which at first sight appears to be so pernicious, is certainly favourable, both to the permanency and to the extension of civilization.\n\nPART II. Of the Expense of Justice\n\nThe second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration of justice, requires two very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society.\n\nAmong nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour; so there is seldom any established magistrate, or any regular administration of justice. Men who have no property, can injure one another only in their persons or reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames another, though he to whom the injury is done suffers, he who does it receives no benefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to property. The benefit of the person who does the injury is often equal to the loss of him who suffers it. Envy, malice, or resentment, are the only passions which can prompt one man to injure another in his person or reputation. But the greater part of men are not very frequently under the influence of those passions; and the very worst men are so only occasionally. As their gratification, too, how agreeable soever it may be to certain characters, is not attended with any real or permanent advantage, it is, in the greater part of men, commonly restrained by prudential considerations. Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property; passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is a great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate, that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate, continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour, civil government is not so necessary.\n\nCivil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property; so the principal causes, which naturally introduce subordination, gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property.\n\nThe causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination, or which naturally and antecedent to any civil institution, give some men some superiority over the greater part of their brethren, seem to be four in number.\nThe first of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of personal qualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom and virtue; of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The qualifications of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can give little authority in any period of society. He is a very strong man, who, by mere strength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The qualifications of the mind can alone give very great authority. They are however, invisible qualities; always disputable, and generally disputed. No society, whether barbarous or civilized, has ever found it convenient to settle the rules of precedency of rank and subordination, according to those invisible qualities; but according to something that is more plain and palpable.\n\nThe second of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of age. An old man, provided his age is not so far advanced as to give suspicion of dotage, is everywhere more respected than a young man of equal rank, fortune, and abilities. Among nations of hunters, such as the native tribes of North America, age is the sole foundation of rank and precedency. Among them, father is the appellation of a superior; brother, of an equal; and son, of an inferior. In the most opulent and civilized nations, age regulates rank among those who are in every other respect equal; and among whom, therefore, there is nothing else to regulate it. Among brothers and among sisters, the eldest always takes place; and in the succession of the paternal estate, every thing which cannot be divided, but must go entire to one person, such as a title of honour, is in most cases given to the eldest. Age is a plain and palpable quality, which admits of no dispute.\n\nThe third of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of fortune. The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of society, is, perhaps, greatest in the rudest ages of society, which admits of any considerable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose flocks and herds is sufficient to maintain a thousand men, cannot well employ that increase in any other way than in maintaining a thousand men. The rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured produce any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption. The thousand men whom he thus maintains, depending entirely upon him for their subsistence, must both obey his orders in war, and submit to his jurisdiction in peace. He is necessarily both their general and their judge, and his chieftainship is the necessary effect of the superiority of his fortune. In an opulent and civilized society, a man may possess a much greater fortune, and yet not be able to command a dozen of people. Though the produce of his estate may be sufficient to maintain, and may, perhaps, actually maintain, more than a thousand people, yet, as those people pay for every thing which they get from him, as he gives scarce any thing to any body but in exchange for an equivalent, there is scarce anybody who considers himself as entirely dependent upon him, and his authority extends only over a few menial servants. The authority of fortune, however, is very great, even in an opulent and civilized society. That it is much greater than that either of age or of personal qualities, has been the constant complaint of every period of society which admitted of any considerable inequality of fortune. The first period of society, that of hunters, admits of no such inequality. Universal poverty establishes their universal equality; and the superiority, either of age or of personal qualities, are the feeble, but the sole foundations of authority and subordination. There is, therefore, little or no authority or subordination in this period of society. The second period of society, that of shepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and there is no period in which the superiority of fortune gives so great authority to those who possess it. There is no period, accordingly, in which authority and subordination are more perfectly established. The authority of an Arabian scherif is very great; that of a Tartar khan altogether despotical.\n\nThe fourth of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of birth. Superiority of birth supposes an ancient superiority of fortune in the family of the person who claims it. All families are equally ancient; and the ancestors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well be more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity of family means everywhere the antiquity either of wealth, or of that greatness which is commonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied with it. Upstart greatness is everywhere less respected than ancient greatness. The hatred of usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch, are in a great measure founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the former, and upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer submits, without reluctance, to the authority of a superior by whom he has always been commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior should be set over his head; so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their ancestors have always submitted; but are fired with indignation when another family, in whom they had never acknowledged any such superiority, assumes a dominion over them.\n\nThe distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune, can have no place in nations of hunters, among whom all men, being equal in fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth. The son of a wise and brave man may, indeed, even among them, be somewhat more respected than a man of equal merit, who has the misfortune to be the son of a fool or a coward. The difference, however will not be very great; and there never was, I believe, a great family in the world, whose illustration was entirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and virtue.\n\nThe distinction of birth not only may, but always does, take place among nations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of luxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by improvident profusion. There are no nations, accordingly, who abound more in families revered and honoured on account of their descent from a long race of great and illustrious ancestors; because there are no nations among whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the same families.\n\nBirth and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which principally set one man above another. They are the two great sources of personal distinction, and are, therefore, the principal causes which naturally establish authority and subordination among men. Among nations of shepherds, both those causes operate with their full force. The great shepherd or herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of the great number of those who depend upon him for subsistence, and revered on account of the nobleness of his birth, and of the immemorial antiquity or his illustrious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior shepherds or herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command the united force of a greater number of people than any of them. His military power is greater than that of any of them. In time of war, they are all of them naturally disposed to muster themselves under his banner, rather than under that of any other person; and his birth and fortune thus naturally procure to him some sort of executive power. By commanding, too, the united force of a greater number of people than any of them, he is best able to compel any one of them, who may have injured another, to compensate the wrong. He is the person, therefore, to whom all those who are too weak to defend themselves naturally look up for protection. It is to him that they naturally complain of the injuries which they imagine have been done to them; and his interposition, in such cases, is more easily submitted to, even by the person complained of, than that of any other person would be. His birth and fortune thus naturally procure him some sort of judicial authority.\n\nIt is in the age of shepherds, in the second period of society, that the inequality of fortune first begins to take place, and introduces among men a degree of authority and subordination, which could not possibly exist before. It thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which is indispensably necessary for its own preservation; and it seems to do this naturally, and even independent of the consideration of that necessity. The consideration of that necessity comes, no doubt, afterwards, to contribute very much to maintain and secure that authority and subordination. The rich, in particular, are necessarily interested to support that order of things, which can alone secure them in the possession of their own advantages. Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel, that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority; and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property, and to support the authority, of their own little sovereign, in order that he may be able to defend their property, and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is, in reality, instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.\n\nThe judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a cause of expense, was, for a long time, a source of revenue to him. The persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it, and a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority of the sovereign, too, was thoroughly established, the person found guilty, over and above the satisfaction which he was obliged to make to the party, was like-wise forced to pay an amercement to the sovereign. He had given trouble, he had disturbed, he had broke the peace of his lord the king, and for those offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar governments of Asia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by the German and Scythian nations who overturned the Roman empire, the administration of justice was a considerable source of revenue, both to the sovereign, and to all the lesser chiefs or lords who exercised under him any particular jurisdiction, either over some particular tribe or clan, or over some particular territory or district. Originally, both the sovereign and the inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in their own persons. Afterwards, they universally found it convenient to delegate it to some substitute, bailiff, or judge. This substitute, however, was still obliged to account to his principal or constituent for the profits of the jurisdiction. Whoever reads the instructions (They are to be found in Tyrol's History of England) which were given to the judges of the circuit in the time of Henry II will see clearly that those judges were a sort of itinerant factors, sent round the country for the purpose of levying certain branches of the king's revenue. In those days, the administration of justice not only afforded a certain revenue to the sovereign, but, to procure this revenue, seems to have been one of the principal advantages which he proposed to obtain by the administration of justice.\n\nThis scheme of making the administration of justice subservient to the purposes of revenue, could scarce fail to be productive of several very gross abuses. The person who applied for justice with a large present in his hand, was likely to get something more than justice; while he who applied for it with a small one was likely to get something less. Justice, too, might frequently be delayed, in order that this present might be repeated. The amercement, besides, of the person complained of, might frequently suggest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong, even when he had not really been so. That such abuses were far from being uncommon, the ancient history of every country in Europe bears witness.\n\nWhen the sovereign or chief exercises his judicial authority in his own person, how much soever he might abuse it, it must have been scarce possible to get any redress; because there could seldom be any body powerful enough to call him to account. When he exercised it by a bailiff, indeed, redress might sometimes be had. If it was for his own benefit only, that the bailiff had been guilty of an act of injustice, the sovereign himself might not always be unwilling to punish him, or to oblige him to repair the wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his sovereign; if it was in order to make court to the person who appointed him, and who might prefer him, that he had committed any act of oppression; redress would, upon most occasions, be as impossible as if the sovereign had committed it himself. In all barbarous governments, accordingly, in all those ancient governments of Europe in particular, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the administration of justice appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt; far from being quite equal and impartial, even under the best monarchs, and altogether profligate under the worst.\n\nAmong nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only the greatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is maintained in the same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the increase of his own herds or flocks. Among those nations of husbandmen, who are but just come out of the shepherd state, and who are not much advanced beyond that state, such as the Greek tribes appear to have been about the time of the Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors, when they first settled upon the ruins of the western empire; the sovereign or chief is, in the same manner, only the greatest landlord of the country, and is maintained in the same manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived from his own private estate, or from what, in modern Europe, was called the demesne of the crown. His subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contribute nothing to his support, except when, in order to protect them from the oppression of some of their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his authority. The presents which they make him upon such occasions constitute the whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except, perhaps, upon some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from his dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles, for his friendship, the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advantage which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was, that the people would honour him with presents. As long as such presents, as long as the emoluments of justice, or what may be called the fees of court, constituted, in this manner, the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived from his sovereignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even decently be proposed, that he should give them up altogether. It might, and it frequently was proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them. But after they had been so regulated and ascertained, how to hinder a person who was all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations, was still very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of this state of things, therefore, the corruption of justice, naturally resulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of those presents, scarce admitted of any effectual remedy.\n\nBut when, from different causes, chiefly from the continually increasing expense of defending the nation against the invasion of other nations, the private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for defraying the expense of the sovereignty; and when it had become necessary that the people should, for their own security, contribute towards this expense by taxes of different kinds; it seems to have been very commonly stipulated, that no present for the administration of justice should, under any pretence, be accepted either by the sovereign, or by his bailiffs and substitutes, the judges. Those presents, it seems to have been supposed, could more easily be abolished altogether, than effectually regulated and ascertained. Fixed salaries were appointed to the judges, which were supposed to compensate to them the loss of whatever might have been their share of the ancient emoluments of justice; as the taxes more than compensated to the sovereign the loss of his. Justice was then said to be administered gratis.\n\nJustice, however, never was in reality administered gratis in any country. Lawyers and attorneys, at least, must always be paid by the parties; and if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than they actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attorneys, amount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the salaries of the judges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown, can nowhere much diminish the necessary expense of a law-suit. But it was not so much to diminish the expense, as to prevent the corruption of justice, that the judges were prohibited from receiving my present or fee from the parties.\n\nThe office of judge is in itself so very honourable, that men are willing to accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The inferior office of justice of peace, though attended with a good deal of trouble, and in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of ambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen. The salaries of all the different judges, high and low, together with the whole expense of the administration and execution of justice, even where it is not managed with very good economy, makes, in any civilized country, but a very inconsiderable part of the whole expense of government.\n\nThe whole expense of justice, too, might easily be defrayed by the fees of court; and, without exposing the administration of justice to any real hazard of corruption, the public revenue might thus be entirely discharged from a certain, though perhaps but a small incumbrance. It is difficult to regulate the fees of court effectually, where a person so powerful as the sovereign is to share in them and to derive any considerable part of his revenue from them. It is very easy, where the judge is the principal person who can reap any benefit from them. The law can very easily oblige the judge to respect the regulation though it might not always be able to make the sovereign respect it. Where the fees of court are precisely regulated and ascertained where they are paid all at once, at a certain period of every process, into the hands of a cashier or receiver, to be by him distributed in certain known proportions among the different judges after the process is decided and not till it is decided; there seems to be no more danger of corruption than when such fees are prohibited altogether. Those fees, without occasioning any considerable increase in the expense of a law-suit, might be rendered fully sufficient for defraying the whole expense of justice. But not being paid to the judges till the process was determined, they might be some incitement to the diligence of the court in examining and deciding it. In courts which consisted of a considerable number of judges, by proportioning the share of each judge to the number of hours and days which he had employed in examining the process, either in the court, or in a committee, by order of the court, those fees might give some encouragement to the diligence of each particular judge. Public services are never better performed, than when their reward comes only in consequence of their being performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them. In the different parliaments of France, the fees of court (called epices and vacations) constitute the far greater part of the emoluments of the judges. After all deductions are made, the neat salary paid by the crown to a counsellor or judge in the parliament of Thoulouse, in rank and dignity the second parliament of the kingdom, amounts only to 150 livres, about \u00a36:11s. sterling a-year. About seven years ago, that sum was in the same place the ordinary yearly wages of a common footman. The distribution of these epices, too, is according to the diligence of the judges. A diligent judge gains a comfortable, though moderate revenue, by his office; an idle one gets little more than his salary. Those parliaments are, perhaps, in many respects, not very convenient courts of justice; but they have never been accused; they seem never even to have been suspected of corruption.\n\nThe fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of the different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw to itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account, willing to take cognizance of many suits which were not originally intended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king's bench, instituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognizance of civil suits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him justice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanour. The court of exchequer, instituted for the levying of the king's revenue, and for enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took cognizance of all other contract debts; the planitiff alleging that he could not pay the king, because the defendant would not pay him. In consequence of such fictions, it came, in many cases, to depend altogether upon the parties, before what court they would choose to have their cause tried, and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and impartiality, to draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present admirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps, originally, in a great measure, formed by this emulation, which anciently took place between their respective judges: each judge endeavouring to give, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would admit, for every sort of injustice. Originally, the courts of law gave damages only for breach of contract. The court of chancery, as a court of conscience, first took upon it to enforce the specific performance of agreements. When the breach of contract consisted in the non-payment of money, the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than by ordering payment, which was equivalent to a specific performance of the agreement. In such cases, therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was sufficient. It was not so in others. When the tenant sued his lord for having unjustly outed him of his lease, the damages which he recovered were by no means equivalent to the possession of the land. Such causes, therefore, for some time, went all to the court of chancery, to the no small loss of the courts of law. It was to draw back such causes to themselves, that the courts of law are said to have invented the artificial and fictitious writ of ejectment, the most effectual remedy for an unjust outer or dispossession of land.\n\nA stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be levied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges, and other officers belonging to it, might in the same manner, afford a revenue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of justice, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the society. The judges, indeed, might in this case, be under the temptation of multiplying unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order to increase, as much as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It has been the custom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions, the payment of the attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of pages which they had occasion to write; the court, however, requiring that each page should contain so many lines, and each line so many words. In order to increase their payment, the attorneys and clerks have contrived to multiply words beyond all necessity, to the corruption of the law language of, I believe, every court of justice in Europe. A like temptation might, perhaps, occasion a like corruption in the form of law proceedings.\n\nBut whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray its own expense, or whether the judges be maintained by fixed salaries paid to them from some other fund, it does not seen necessary that the person or persons entrusted with the executive power should be charged with the management of that fund, or with the payment of those salaries. That fund might arise from the rent of landed estates, the management of each estate being entrusted to the particular court which was to be maintained by it. That fund might arise even from the interest of a sum of money, the lending out of which might, in the same manner, be entrusted to the court which was to be maintained by it. A part, though indeed but a small part of the salary of the judges of the court of session in Scotland, arises from the interest of a sum of money. The necessary instability of such a fund seems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of an institution which ought to last for ever.\n\nThe separation of the judicial from the executive power, seems originally to have arisen from the increasing business of the society, in consequence of its increasing improvement. The administration of justice became so laborious and so complicated a duty, as to require the undivided attention of the person to whom it was entrusted. The person entrusted with the executive power, not having leisure to attend to the decision of private causes himself, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead. In the progress of the Roman greatness, the consul was too much occupied with the political affairs of the state, to attend to the administration of justice. A praetor, therefore, was appointed to administer it in his stead. In the progress of the European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the sovereigns and the great lords came universally to consider the administration of justice as an office both too laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons. They universally, therefore, discharged themselves of it, by appointing a deputy, bailiff or judge.\nWhen the judicial is united to the executive power, it is scarce possible that justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly called politics. The persons entrusted with the great interests of the state may even without any corrupt views, sometimes imagine it necessary to sacrifice to those interests the rights of a private man. But upon the impartial administration of justice depends the liberty of every individual, the sense which he has of his own security. In order to make every individual feel himself perfectly secure in the possession of every right which belongs to him, it is not only necessary that the judicial should be separated from the executive power, but that it should be rendered as much as possible independent of that power. The judge should not be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of that power. The regular payment of his salary should not depend upon the good will, or even upon the good economy of that power.\n\nPART III. Of the Expense of public Works and public Institutions.\n\nThe third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth, is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual, or small number of individuals; and which it, therefore, cannot be expected that any individual, or small number of individuals, should erect or maintain. The performance of this duty requires, too, very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society.\n\nAfter the public institutions and public works necessary for the defence of the society, and for the administration of justice, both of which have already been mentioned, the other works and institutions of this kind are chiefly for facilitating the commerce of the society, and those for promoting the instruction of the people. The institutions for instruction are of two kinds: those for the education of the youth, and those for the instruction of people of all ages. The consideration of the manner in which the expense of those different sorts of public works and institutions may be most properly defrayed will divide this third part of the present chapter into three different articles.\n\nARTICLE I.\u2014Of the public Works and Institutions for facilitating the Commerce of the Society.\n\nAnd, first, of those which are necessary for facilitating Commerce in general.\n\nThat the erection and maintenance of the public works which facilitate the commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals, harbours, etc. must require very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society, is evident without any proof. The expense of making and maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently increase with the annual produce of the land and labour of that country, or with the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to fetch and carry upon those roads. The strength of a bridge must be suited to the number and weight of the carriages which are likely to pass over it. The depth and the supply of water for a navigable canal must be proportioned to the number and tonnage of the lighters which are likely to carry goods upon it; the extent of a harbour, to the number of the shipping which are likely to take shelter in it.\n\nIt does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works should be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of which the collection and application are in most countries, assigned to the executive power. The greater part of such public works may easily be so managed, as to afford a particular revenue, sufficient for defraying their own expense without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the society.\n\nA highway, a bridge, a navigable canal, for example, may, in most cases, be both made add maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which make use of them; a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the tonnage of the shipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another institution for facilitating commerce, in many countries, not only defrays its own expense, but affords a small revenue or a seignorage to the sovereign. The post-office, another institution for the same purpose, over and above defraying its own expense, affords, in almost all countries, a very considerable revenue to the sovereign.\n\nWhen the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the lighters which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their weight or their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public works exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of them. It seems scarce possible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining such works. This tax or toll, too, though it is advanced by the carrier, is finally paid by the consumer, to whom it must always be charged in the price of the goods. As the expense of carriage, however, is very much reduced by means of such public works, the goods, notwithstanding the toll, come cheaper to the consumer than they could otherwise have done, their price not being so much raised by the toll, as it is lowered by the cheapness of the carriage. The person who finally pays this tax, therefore, gains by the application more than he loses by the payment of it. His payment is exactly in proportion to his gain. It is, in reality, no more than a part of that gain which he is obliged to give up, in order to get the rest. It seems impossible to imagine a more equitable method of raising a tax. When the toll upon carriages of luxury, upon coaches, post-chaises, etc. is made somewhat higher in proportion to their weight, than upon carriages of necessary use, such as carts, waggons, etc. the indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute, in a very easy manner, to the relief of the poor, by rendering cheaper the transportation of heavy goods to all the different parts of the country.\n\nWhen high-roads, bridges, canals, etc. are in this manner made and supported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they can be made only where that commerce requires them, and, consequently, where it is proper to make them. Their expense, too, their grandeur and magnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay. They must be made, consequently, as it is proper to make them. A magnificent high-road cannot be made through a desert country, where there is little or no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to the country villa of the intendant of the province, or to that of some great lord, to whom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes, or merely to embellish the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace; things which sometimes happen in countries, where works of this kind are carried on by any other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of affording.\n\nIn several different parts of Europe, the toll or lock-duty upon a canal is the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them to keep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation necessarily ceases altogether, and, along with it, the whole profit which they can make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under the management of commissioners, who had themselves no interest in them, they might be less attentive to the maintenance of the works which produced them. The canal of Languedoc cost the king of France and the province upwards of thirteen millions of livres, which (at twenty-eight livres the mark of silver, the value of French money in the end of the last century) amounted to upwards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling. When that great work was finished, the most likely method, it was found, of keeping it in constant repair, was to make a present of the tolls to Riquet, the engineer who planned and conducted the work. Those tolls constitute, at present, a very large estate to the different branches of the family of that gentleman, who have, therefore, a great interest to keep the work in constant repair. But had those tolls been put under the management of commissioners, who had no such interest, they might perhaps, have been dissipated in ornamental and unnecessary expenses, while the most essential parts of the works were allowed to go to ruin.\n\nThe tolls for the maintenance of a highroad cannot, with any safety, be made the property of private persons. A high-road, though entirely neglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does. The proprietors of the tolls upon a high-road, therefore, might neglect altogether the repair of the road, and yet continue to levy very nearly the same tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the maintenance of such a work should be put under the management of commissioners or trustees.\n\nIn Great Britain, the abuses which the trustees have committed in the management of those tolls, have, in many cases, been very justly complained of. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is more than double of what is necessary for executing, in the completest manner, the work, which is often executed in a very slovenly manner, and sometimes not executed at all. The system of repairing the high-roads by tolls of this kind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing. We should not wonder, therefore, if it has not yet been brought to that degree of perfection of which it seems capable. If mean and improper persons are frequently appointed trustees; and if proper courts of inspection and account have not yet been established for controlling their conduct, and for reducing the tolls to what is barely sufficient for executing the work to be done by them; the recency of the institution both accounts and apologizes for those defects, of which, by the wisdom of parliament, the greater part may, in due time, be gradually remedied.\n\nThe money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain, is supposed to exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads, that the savings which, with proper economy, might be made from it, have been considered, even by some ministers, as a very great resource, which might, at some time or another, be applied to the exigencies of the state. Government, it has been said, by taking the management of the turnpikes into its own hands, and by employing the soldiers, who would work for a very small addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order, at a much less expense than it can be done by trustees, who have no other workmen to employ, but such as derive their whole subsistence from their wages. A great revenue, half a million, perhaps {\u200bSince publishing the two first editions of this book, I have got good reasons to believe that all the turnpike tolls levied in Great Britain do not produce a neat revenue that amounts to half a million; a sum which, under the management of government, would not be sufficient to keep, in repair five of the principal roads in the kingdom}\u200b, it has been pretended, might in this manner be gained, without laying any new burden upon the people; and the turnpike roads might be made to contribute to the general expense of the state, in the same manner as the post-office does at present.\n\nThat a considerable revenue might be gained in this manner, I have no doubt, though probably not near so much as the projectors of this plan have supposed. The plan itself, however, seems liable to several very important objections.\n\nFirst, If the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be considered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the state, they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed to require. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they would probably he augmented very fast. The facility with which a great revenue could be drawn from them, would probably encourage administration to recur very frequently te this resource. Though it may, perhaps, be more than doubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of the present tolls, it can scarcely be doubted, but that a million might be saved out of them, if they were doubled; and perhaps two millions, if they were tripled {\u200bI have now good reason to believe that all these conjectural sums are by much too large.}\u200b. This great revenue, too, might be levied without the appointment of a single new officer to collect and receive it. But the turnpike tolls, being continually augmented in this manner, instead of facilitating the inland commerce of the country, as at present, would soon become a very great incumbrance upon it. The expense of transporting all heavy goods from one part of the country to another, would soon be so much increased, the market for all such goods, consequently, would soon be so much narrowed, that their production would be in a great measure discouraged, and the most important branches of the domestic industry of the country annihilated altogether.\n\nSecondly, A tax upon carriages, in proportion to their weight, though a very equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of repairing the roads, is a very unequal one when applied to any other purpose, or to supply the common exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the sole purpose above mentioned, each carriage is supposed to pay exactly for the wear and tear which that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to any other purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that wear and tear, and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of the state. But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to their weight and not to their value, it is chiefly paid by the consumers of coarse and bulky, not by those of precious and light commodities. Whatever exigency of the state, therefore, this tax might be intended to supply, that exigency would be chiefly supplied at the expense of the poor, not of the rich; at the expense of those who are least able to supply it, not of those who are most able.\n\nThirdly, If government should at any time neglect the reparation of the high-roads, it would be still more difficult, than it is at present, to compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large revenue might thus be levied upon the people, without any part of it being applied to the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought ever to be applied. If the meanness and poverty of the trustees of turnpike roads render it sometimes difficult, at present, to oblige them to repair their wrong; their wealth and greatness would render it ten times more so in the case which is here supposed.\nIn France, the funds destined for the reparation of the high-roads are under the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist, partly in a certain number of days labour, which the country people are in most parts of Europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways; and partly in such a portion of the general revenue of the state as the king chooses to spare from his other expenses.\n\nBy the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of Europe, the labour of the country people was under the direction of a local or provincial magistracy, which had no immediate dependency upon the king's council. But, by the present practice, both the labour of the country people, and whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for the reparation of the high-roads in any particular province or generality, are entirely under the management of the intendant; an officer who is appointed and removed by the king's council who receives his orders from it, and is in constant correspondence with it. In the progress of despotism, the authority of the executive power gradually absorbs that of every other power in the state, and assumes to itself the management of every branch of revenue which is destined for any public purpose. In France, however, the great post-roads, the roads which make the communication between the principal towns of the kingdom, are in general kept in good order; and, in some provinces, are even a good deal superior to the greater part of the turnpike roads of England. But what we call the cross roads, that is, the far greater part of the roads in the country, are entirely neglected, and are in many places absolutely impassable for any heavy carriage. In some places it is even dangerous to travel on horseback, and mules are the only conveyance which can safely be trusted. The proud minister of an ostentatious court, may frequently take pleasure in executing a work of splendour and magnificence, such as a great highway, which is frequently seen by the principal nobility, whose applauses not only flatter his vanity, but even contribute to support his interest at court. But to execute a great number of little works, in which nothing that can be done can make any great appearance, or excite the smallest degree of admiration in any traveller, and which, in short, have nothing to recommend them but their extreme utility, is a business which appears, in every respect, too mean and paltry to merit the attention of so great a magistrate. Under such an administration therefore, such works are almost always entirely neglected.\n\nIn China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive power charges itself both with the reparation of the high-roads, and with the maintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are given to the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are constantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to have paid to this part of his instructions. This branch of public police, accordingly, is said to be very much attended to in all those countries, but particularly in China, where the high-roads, and still more the navigable canals, it is pretended, exceed very much every thing of the same kind which is known in Europe. The accounts of those works, however, which have been transmitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by weak and wondering travellers; frequently by stupid and lying missionaries. If they had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if the accounts of them had been reported by more faithful witnesses, they would not, perhaps, appear to be so wonderful. The account which Bernier gives of some works of this kind in Indostan, falls very short of what had been reported of them by other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous than he was. It may too, perhaps, be in those countries, as it is in France, where the great roads, the great communications, which are likely to be the subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital, are attended to, and all the rest neglected. In China, besides, in Indostan, and in several other governments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign arises almost altogether from a land tax or land rent, which rises or falls with the rise and fall of the annual produce of the land. The great interest of the sovereign, therefore, his revenue, is in such countries necessarily and immediately connected with the cultivation of the land, with the greatness of its produce, and with the value of its produce. But in order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as possible, it is necessary to procure to it as extensive a market as possible, and consequently to establish the freest, the easiest, and the least expensive communication between all the different parts of the country; which can be done only by means of the best roads and the best navigable canals. But the revenue of the sovereign does not, in any part of Europe, arise chiefly from a land tax or land rent. In all the great kingdoms of Europe, perhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately depend upon the produce of the land: but that dependency is neither so immediate nor so evident. In Europe, therefore, the sovereign does not feel himself so directly called upon to promote the increase, both in quantity and value of the produce of the land, or, by maintaining good roads and canals, to provide the most extensive market for that produce. Though it should be true, therefore, what I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that in some parts of Asia this department of the public police is very properly managed by the executive power, there is not the least probability that, during the present state of things, it could be tolerably managed by that power in any part of Europe.\nEven those public works, which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the conveniency is nearly confined to some particular place or district, are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state, of which the executive power must always have the management. Were the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the expense of the treasury, is there any probability that they would be so well lighted and paved as they are at present, or even at so small an expense? The expense, besides, instead of being raised by a local tax upon the inhabitants of each particular street, parish, or district in London, would, in this case, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the state, and would consequently be raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the greater part derive no sort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the streets of London.\n\nThe abuses which sometimes creep into the local and provincial administration of a local and provincial revenue, how enormous soever they may appear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling in comparison of those which commonly take place in the administration and expenditure of the revenue of a great empire. They are, besides, much more easily corrected. Under the local or provincial administration of the justices of the peace in Great Britain, the six days labour which the country people are obliged to give to the reparation of the highways, is not always, perhaps, very judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever exacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression. In France, under the administration of the intendants, the application is not always more judicious, and the exaction is frequently the most cruel and oppressive. Such corvees, as they are called, make one of the principal instruments of tyranny by which those officers chastise any parish or communeaute, which has had the misfortune to fall under their displeasure.\n\nOf the public Works and Institution which are necessary for facilitating particular Branches of Commerce.\nThe object of the public works and institutions above mentioned, is to facilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular branches of it, particular institutions are necessary, which again require a particular and extraordinary expense.\n\nSome particular branches of commerce which are carried on with barbarous and uncivilized nations, require extraordinary protection. An ordinary store or counting-house could give little security to the goods of the merchants who trade to the western coast of Africa. To defend them from the barbarous natives, it is necessary that the place where they are deposited should be in some measure fortified. The disorders in the government of Indostan have been supposed to render a like precaution necessary, even among that mild and gentle people; and it was under pretence of securing their persons and property from violence, that both the English and French East India companies were allowed to erect the first forts which they possessed in that country. Among other nations, whose vigorous government will suffer no strangers to possess any fortified place within their territory, it may be necessary to maintain some ambassador, minister, or consul, who may both decide, according to their own customs, the differences arising among his own countrymen, and, in their disputes with the natives, may by means of his public character, interfere with more authority and afford them a more powerful protection than they could expect from any private man. The interests of commerce have frequently made it necessary to maintain ministers in foreign countries, where the purposes either of war or alliance would not have required any. The commerce of the Turkey company first occasioned the establishment of an ordinary ambassador at Constantinople. The first English embassies to Russia arose altogether from commercial interests. The constant interference with those interests, necessarily occasioned between the subjects of the different states of Europe, has probably introduced the custom of keeping, in all neighbouring countries, ambassadors or ministers constantly resident, even in the time of peace. This custom, unknown to ancient times, seems not to be older than the end of the fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century; that is, than the time when commerce first began to extend itself to the greater part of the nations of Europe, and when they first began to attend to its interests.\n\nIt seems not unreasonable, that the extraordinary expense which the protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion, should be defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate fine, for example, to be paid by the traders when they first enter into it; or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of so much per cent. upon the goods which they either import into, or export out of, the particular countries with which it is carried on. The protection of trade, in general, from pirates and freebooters, is said to have given occasion to the first institution of the duties of customs. But, if it was thought reasonable to lay a general tax upon trade, in order to defray the expense of protecting trade in general, it should seem equally reasonable to lay a particular tax upon a particular branch of trade, in order to defray the extraordinary expense of protecting that branch.\n\nThe protection of trade, in general, has always been considered as essential to the defence of the commonwealth, and, upon that account, a necessary part of the duty of the executive power. The collection and application of the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been left to that power. But the protection of any particular branch of trade is a part of the general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the duty of that power; and if nations always acted consistently, the particular duties levied for the purposes of such particular protection, should always have been left equally to its disposal. But in this respect, as well as in many others, nations have not always acted consistently; and in the greater part of the commercial states of Europe, particular companies of merchants have had the address to persuade the legislature to entrust to them the performance of this part of the duty of the sovereign, together with all the powers which are necessarily connected with it.\nThese companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the first introduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own expense, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to make, have in the long-run proved, universally, either burdensome or useless, and have either mismanaged or confined the trade.\n\nWhen those companies do not trade upon a joint stock, but are obliged to admit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and agreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member trading upon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called regulated companies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member sharing in the common profit or loss, in proportion to his share in this stock, they are called joint-stock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or joint-stock, sometimes have, and sometimes have not, exclusive privileges.\n\nRegulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporation of trades, so common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of Europe; and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind. As no inhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade, without first obtaining his freedom in the incorporation, so, in most cases, no subject of the state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which a regulated company is established, without first becoming a member of that company. The monopoly is more or less strict, according as the terms of admission are more or less difficult, and according as the directors of the company have more or less authority, or have it more or less in their power to manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the trade to themselves and their particular friends. In the most ancient regulated companies, the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in other corporations, and entitled the person who had served his time to a member of the company, to become himself a member, either without paying any fine, or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other people. The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain it, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to act according to their natural genius, they have always, in order to confine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations. When the law has restrained them from doing this, they have become altogether useless and insignificant.\n\nThe regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present subsist in Great Britain, are the ancient merchant-adventurers company, now commonly called the Hamburgh company, the Russia company, the Eastland company, the Turkey company, and the African company.\n\nThe terms of admission into the Hamburgh company are now said to be quite easy; and the directors either have it not in their power to subject the trade to any troublesome restraint or regulations, or, at least, have not of late exercised that power. It has not always been so. About the middle of the last century, the fine for admission was fifty, and at one time one hundred pounds, and the conduct of the company was said to be extremely oppressive. In 1643, in 1645, and in 1661, the clothiers and free traders of the west of England complained of them to parliament, as of monopolists, who confined the trade, and oppressed the manufactures of the country. Though those complaints produced no act of parliament, they had probably intimidated the company so far, as to oblige them to reform their conduct. Since that time, at least, there have been no complaints against them. By the 10th and 11th of William III. c.6, the fine for admission into the Russia company was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of Charles II. c.7, that for admission into the Eastland company to forty shillings; while, at the same time, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, all the countries on the north side of the Baltic, were exempted from their exclusive charter. The conduct of those companies had probably given occasion to those two acts of parliament. Before that time, Sir Josiah Child had represented both these and the Hamburgh company as extremely oppressive, and imputed to their bad management the low state of the trade, which we at that time carried on to the countries comprehended within their respective charters. But though such companies may not, in the present times, be very oppressive, they are certainly altogether useless. To be merely useless, indeed, is perhaps, the highest eulogy which can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated company; and all the three companies above mentioned seem, in their present state, to deserve this eulogy.\n\nThe fine for admission into the Turkey company was formerly twenty-five pounds for all persons under twenty-six years of age, and fifty pounds for all persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be admitted; a restriction which excluded all shop-keepers and retailers. By a bye-law, no British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but in the general ships of the company; and as those ships sailed always from the port of London, this restriction confined the trade to that expensive port, and the traders to those who lived in London and in its neighbourhood. By another bye-law, no person living within twenty miles of London, and not free of the city, could be admitted a member; another restriction which, joined to the foregoing, necessarily excluded all but the freemen of London. As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships depended altogether upon the directors, they could easily fill them with their own goods, and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion of others, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In this state of things, therefore, this company was, in every respect, a strict and oppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of the 26th of George II. c. 18, reducing the fine for admission to twenty pounds for all persons, without any distinction of ages, or any restriction, either to mere merchants, or to the freemen of London; and granting to all such persons the liberty of exporting, from all the ports of Great Britain, to any port in Turkey, all British goods, of which the exportation was not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of customs, and the particular duties assessed for defraying the necessary expenses of the company; and submitting, at the same time, to the lawful authority of the British ambassador and consuls resident in Turkey, and to the bye-laws of the company duly enacted. To prevent any oppression by those bye-laws, it was by the same act ordained, that if any seven members of the company conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should be enacted after the passing of this act, they might appeal to the board of trade and plantations (to the authority of which a committee of the privy council has now succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within twelve months after the bye-law was enacted; and that, if any seven members conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been enacted before the passing of this act, they might bring a like appeal, provided it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was to take place. The experience of one year, however, may not always be sufficient to discover to all the members of a great company the pernicious tendency of a particular bye-law; and if several of them should afterwards discover it, neither the board of trade, nor the committee of council, can afford them any redress. The object, besides, of the greater part of the bye-laws of all regulated companies, as well as of all other corporations, is not so much to oppress those who are already members, as to discourage others from becoming so; which may be done, not only by a high fine, but by many other contrivances. The constant view of such companies is always to raise the rate of their own profit as high as they can; to keep the market, both for the goods which they export, and for those which they import, as much understocked as they can; which can be done only by restraining the competition, or by discouraging new adventurers from entering into the trade. A fine, even of twenty pounds, besides, though it may not, perhaps, be sufficient to discourage any man from entering into the Turkey trade, with an intention to continue in it, may be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from hazarding a single adventure in it. In all trades, the regular established traders, even though not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits, which are noway so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper level, as by the occasional competition of speculative adventurers. The Turkey trade, though in some measure laid open by this act of parliament, is still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free. The Turkey company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or three consuls, who, like other public ministers, ought to be maintained altogether by the state, and the trade laid open to all his majesty's subjects. The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other corporation purposes, might afford a revenue much more than sufficient to enable a state to maintain such ministers.\nRegulated companies, it was observed by Sir Josiah Child, though they had frequently supported public ministers, had never maintained any forts or garrisons in the countries to which they traded; whereas joint-stock companies frequently had. And, in reality, the former seem to be much more unfit for this sort of service than the latter. First, the directors of a regulated company have no particular interest in the prosperity of the general trade of the company, for the sake of which such forts and garrisons are maintained. The decay of that general trade may even frequently contribute to the advantage of their own private trade; as, by diminishing the number of their competitors, it may enable them both to buy cheaper, and to sell dearer. The directors of a joint-stock company, on the contrary, having only their share in the profits which are made upon the common stock committed to their management, have no private trade of their own, of which the interest can be separated from that of the general trade of the company. Their private interest is connected with the prosperity of the general trade of the company, and with the maintenance of the forts and garrisons which are necessary for its defence. They are more likely, therefore, to have that continual and careful attention which that maintenance necessarily requires. Secondly, The directors of a joint-stock company have always the management of a large capital, the joint stock of the company, a part of which they may frequently employ, with propriety, in building, repairing, and maintaining such necessary forts and garrisons. But the directors of a regulated company, having the management of no common capital, have no other fund to employ in this way, but the casual revenue arising from the admission fines, and from the corporation duties imposed upon the trade of the company. Though they had the same interest, therefore, to attend to the maintenance of such forts and garrisons, they can seldom have the same ability to render that attention effectual. The maintenance of a public minister, requiring scarce any attention, and but a moderate and limited expense, is a business much more suitable both to the temper and abilities of a regulated company.\n\nLong after the time of Sir Josiah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated company was established, the present company of merchants trading to Africa; which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all the British forts and garrisons that lie between Cape Blanc and the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards with that of those only which lie between Cape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which establishes this company (the 23rd of George II. c.51 ), seems to have had two distinct objects in view; first, to restrain effectually the oppressive and monopolizing spirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated company; and, secondly, to force them, as much as possible, to give an attention, which is not natural to them, towards the maintenance of forts and garrisons.\n\nFor the first of these purposes, the fine for admission is limited to forty shillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate capacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon common seal, or from laying any restraints upon the trade, which may be carried on freely from all places, and by all persons being British subjects, and paying the fine. The government is in a committee of nine persons, who meet at London, but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company at London, Bristol, and Liverpool; three from each place. No committeeman can be continued in office for more than three years together. Any committee-man might be removed by the board of trade and plantations, now by a committee of council, after being heard in his own defence. The committee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to import any African goods into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the maintenance of forts and garrisons, they may, for that purpose export from Great Britain to Africa goods and stores of different kinds. Out of the moneys which they shall receive from the company, they are allowed a sum, not exceeding eight hundred pounds, for the salaries of their clerks and agents at London, Bristol, and Liverpool, the house-rent of their offices at London, and all other expenses of management, commission, and agency, in England. What remains of this sum, after defraying these different expenses, they may divide among themselves, as compensation for their trouble, in what manner they think proper. By this constitution, it might have been expected, that the spirit of monopoly would have been effectually restrained, and the first of these purposes sufficiently answered. It would seem, however, that it had not. Though by the 4th of George III. c.20, the fort of Senegal, with all its dependencies, had been invested in the company of merchants trading to Africa, yet, in the year following (by the 5th of George III. c.44), not only Senegal and its dependencies, but the whole coast, from the port of Sallee, in South Barbary, to Cape Rouge, was exempted from the jurisdiction of that company, was vested in the crown, and the trade to it declared free to all his majesty's subjects. The company had been suspected of restraining the trade and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly. It is not, however, very easy to conceive how, under the regulations of the 23d George II. they could do so. In the printed debates of the house of commons, not always the most authentic records of truth, I observe, however, that they have been accused of this. The members of the committee of nine being all merchants, and the governors and factors in their different forts and settlements being all dependent upon them, it is not unlikely that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the consignments and commissions of the former, which would establish a real monopoly.\n\nFor the second of these purposes, the maintenance of the forts and garrisons, an annual sum has been allotted to them by parliament, generally about \u00a313,000. For the proper application of this sum, the committee is obliged to account annually to the cursitor baron of exchequer; which account is afterwards to be laid before parliament. But parliament, which gives so little attention to the application of millions, is not likely to give much to that of \u00a313,000 a-year; and the cursitor baron of exchequer, from his profession and education, is not likely to be profoundly skilled in the proper expense of forts and garrisons. The captains of his majesty's navy, indeed, or any other commissioned officers, appointed by the board of admiralty, may inquire into the condition of the forts and garrisons, and report their observations to that board. But that board seems to have no direct jurisdiction over the committee, nor any authority to correct those whose conduct it may thus inquire into; and the captains of his majesty's navy, besides, are not supposed to be always deeply learned in the science of fortification. Removal from an office, which can be enjoyed only for the term of three years, and of which the lawful emoluments, even during that term, are so very small, seems to be the utmost punishment to which any committee-man is liable, for any fault, except direct malversation, or embezzlement, either of the public money, or of that of the company; and the fear of the punishment can never be a motive of sufficient weight to force a continual and careful attention to a business to which he has no other interest to attend. The committee are accused of having sent out bricks and stones from England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle, on the coast of Guinea; a business for which parliament had several times granted an extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones, too, which had thus been sent upon so long a voyage, were said to have been of so bad a quality, that it was necessary to rebuild, from the foundation, the walls which had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie north of Cape Rouge, are not only maintained at the expense of the state, but are under the immediate government of the executive power; and why those which lie south of that cape, and which, too, are, in part at least, maintained at the expense of the state, should be under a different government, it seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason. The protection of the Mediterranean trade was the original purpose or pretence of the garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorca; and the maintenance and government of those garrisons have always been, very properly, committed, not to the Turkey company, but to the executive power. In the extent of its dominion consists, in a great measure, the pride and dignity of that power; and it is not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary for the defence of that dominion. The garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca, accordingly, have never been neglected. Though Minorca has been twice taken, and is now probably lost for ever, that disaster has never been imputed to any neglect in the executive power. I would not, however, be understood to insinuate, that either of those expensive garrisons was ever, even in the smallest degree, necessary for the purpose for which they were originally dismembered from the Spanish monarchy. That dismemberment, perhaps, never served any other real purpose than to alienate from England her natural ally the king of Spain, and to unite the two principal branches of the house of Bourbon in a much stricter and more permanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them.\n\nJoint-stock companies, established either by royal charter, or by act of parliament, are different in several respects, not only from regulated companies, but from private copartneries.\n\nFirst, In a private copartnery, no partner without the consent of the company, can transfer his share to another person, or introduce a new member into the company. Each member, however, may, upon proper warning, withdraw from the copartnery, and demand payment from them of his share of the common stock. In a joint-stock company, on the contrary, no member can demand payment of his share from the company; but each member can, without their consent, transfer his share to another person, and thereby introduce a new member. The value of a share in a joint stock is always the price which it will bring in the market; and this may be either greater or less in any proportion, than the sum which its owner stands credited for in the stock of the company.\n\nSecondly, In a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts contracted by the company, to the whole extent of his fortune. In a joint-stock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the extent of his share.\nThe trade of a joint-stock company is always managed by a court of directors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to the control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of these proprietors seldom pretend to understand any thing of the business of the company; and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly such halfyearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them. This total exemption front trouble and front risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint-stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves much greater stocks, than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading stock of the South Sea company at one time amounted to upwards of thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds. The divided capital of the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company. It is upon this account, that joint-stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competition against private adventurers. They have, accordingly, very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege; and frequently have not succeeded with one. Without an exclusive privilege, they have commonly mismanaged the trade. With an exclusive privilege, they have both mismanaged and confined it.\n\nThe Royal African company, the predecessors of the present African company, had an exclusive privilege by charter; but as that charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament, the trade, in consequence of the declaration of rights, was, soon after the Revolution, laid open to all his majesty's subjects. The Hudson's Bay company are, as to their legal rights, in the same situation as the Royal African company. Their exclusive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament. The South Sea company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an exclusive privilege confirmed by act of parliament; as have likewise the present united company of merchants trading to the East Indies.\n\nThe Royal African company soon found that they could not maintain the competition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the declaration of rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers, and to persecute as such. In 1698, however, the private adventurers were subjected to a duty of ten per cent. upon almost all the different branches of their trade, to be employed by the company in the maintenance of their forts and garrisons. But, notwithstanding this heavy tax, the company were still unable to maintain the competition. Their stock and credit gradually declined. In 1712, their debts had become so great, that a particular act of parliament was thought necessary, both for their security and for that of their creditors. It was enacted, that the resolution of two-thirds of these creditors in number and value should bind the rust, both with regard to the time which should be allowed to the company for the payment of their debts, and with regard to any other agreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concerning those debts. In 1730, their affairs were in so great disorder, that they were altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garrisons, the sole purpose and pretext of their institution. From that year till their final dissolution, the parliament judged it necessary to allow the annual sum of \u00a310,000 for that purpose. In 1732, after having been for many years losers by the trade of carrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last resolved to give it up altogether; to sell to the private traders to America the negroes which they purchased upon the coast; awl to employ their servants in a trade to the inland parts of Africa for gold dust, elephants teeth, dyeing drugs, etc. But their success in this more confined trade was not greater than in their former extensive one. Their affairs continued to go gradually to decline, till at last, being in every respect a bankrupt company, they were dissolved by act of parliament, and their forts and garrisons vested in the present regulated company of merchants trading to Africa. Before the erection of the Royal African company, there had been three other joint-stock companies successively established, one after another, for the African trade. They were all equally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive charters, which, though not confirmed by act of parliament, were in those days supposed to convey a real exclusive privilege.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay company, before their misfortunes in the late war, had been much more fortunate than the Royal African company. Their necessary expense is much smaller. The whole number of people whom they maintain in their different settlements and habitations, which they have honoured with the name of forts, is said not to exceed a hundred and twenty persons. This number, however, is sufficient to prepare beforehand the cargo of furs and other goods necessary for loading their ships, which, on account of the ice, can seldom remain above six or eight weeks in those seas. This advantage of having a cargo ready prepared, could not, for several years, be acquired by private adventurers; and without it there seems to be no possibility of trading to Hudson's Bay. The moderate capital of the company, which, it is said, does not exceed one hundred and ten thousand pounds, may, besides, be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole, or almost the whole trade and surplus produce, of the miserable though extensive country comprehended within their charter. No private adventurers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in competition with them. This company, therefore, have always enjoyed an exclusive trade, in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over and above all this, the moderate capital of this company is said to be divided among a very small number of proprietors. But a joint-stock company, consisting of a small number of proprietors, with a moderate capital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a private copartnery, and may be capable of nearly the same degree of vigilance and attention. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if, in consequence of these different advantages, the Hudson's Bay company had, before the late war, been able to carry on their trade with a considerable degree of success. It does not seem probable, however, that their profits ever approached to what the late Mr Dobbs imagined them. A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr Anderson, author of the Historical and Chronological Deduction of Commerce, very justly observes, that upon examining the accounts which Mr Dobbs himself has given for several years together, of their exports and imports, and upon making proper allowances for their extraordinary risk and expense, it does not appear that their profits deserve to be envied, or that they can much, if at all, exceed the ordinary profits of trade.\n\nThe South Sea company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain, and therefore were entirely exempted from one great expense, to which other joint-stock companies for foreign trade are subject; but they had an immense capital divided among an immense number of proprietors. It was naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and profusion, should prevail in the whole management of their affairs. The knavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently known, and the explication of them would be foreign to the present subject. Their mercantile projects were not much better conducted. The first trade which they engaged in, was that of supplying the Spanish West Indies with negroes, of which (in consequence of what was called the Assiento Contract granted them by the treaty of Utrecht) they had the exclusive privilege. But as it was not expected that much profit could be made by this trade, both the Portuguese and French companies, who had enjoyed it upon the same terms before them, having been ruined by it, they were allowed, as compensation, to send annually a ship of a certain burden, to trade directly to the Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages which this annual ship was allowed to make, they are said to have gained considerably by one, that of the Royal Caroline, in 1731; and to have been losers, more or less, by almost all the rest. Their ill success was imputed, by their factors and agents, to the extortion and oppression of the Spanish government; but was, perhaps, principally owing to the profusion and depredations of those very factors and agents; some of whom are said to have acquired great fortunes, even in one year. In 1734, the company petitioned the king, that they might be allowed to dispose of the trade and tonnage of their annual ship, on account of the little profit which they made by it, and to accept of such equivalent as they could obtain from the king of Spain.\n\nIn 1724, this company had undertaken the whale fishery. Of this, indeed, they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other British subjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which their ships made to Greenland, they were gainers by one, and losers by all the rest. After their eighth and last voyage, when they had sold their ships, stores, and utensils, they found that their whole loss upon this branch, capital and interest included, amounted to upwards of \u00a3237,000.\nIn 1722, this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide their immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government, into two equal parts; the one half, or upwards of \u00a316,900,000, to be put upon the same footing with other government annuities, and not to be subject to the debts contracted, or losses incurred, by the directors of the company, in the prosecution of their mercantile projects; the other half to remain as before, a trading stock, and to be subject to those debts and losses. The petition was too reasonable not to be granted. In 1733, they again petitioned the parliament, that three-fourths of their trading stock might be turned into annuity stock, and only one-fourth remain as trading stock, or exposed to the hazards arising from the bad management of their directors. Both their annuity and trading stocks had, by this time, been reduced more than two millions each, by several different payments from government; so that this fourth amounted only to \u00a33,662,784:8:6. In 1748, all the demands of the company upon the king of Spain, in consequence of the assiento contract, were, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, given up for what was supposed an equivalent. An end was put to their trade with the Spanish West Indies; the remainder of their trading stock was turned into an annuity stock; and the company ceased, in every respect, to be a trading company.\n\nIt ought to be observed, that in the trade which the South Sea company carried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by which it ever was expected that they could make any considerable profit, they were not without competitors, either in the foreign or in the home market. At Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the competition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from Cadiz to those markets European goods, of the same kind with the outward cargo of their ship; and in England they had to encounter that of the English merchants, who imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish West Indies, of the same kind with the inward cargo. The goods, both of the Spanish and English merchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to higher duties. But the loss occasioned by the negligence, profusion, and malversation of the servants of the company, had probably been a tax much heavier than all those duties. That a joint-stock company should be able to carry on successfully any branch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any sort of open and fair competition with them, seems contrary to all experience.\n\nThe old English East India company was established in 1600, by a charter from Queen Elizabeth. In the first twelve voyages which they fitted out for India, they appear to have traded as a regulated company, with separate stocks, though only in the general ships of the company. In 1612, they united into a joint stock. Their charter was exclusive, and, though not confirmed by act of parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a real exclusive privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much disturbed by interlopers. Their capital, which never exceeded \u00a3744,000, and of which \u00a350 was a share, was not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so extensive, as to afford either a pretext for gross negligence and profusion, or a cover to gross malversation. Notwithstanding some extraordinary losses, occasioned partly by the malice of the Dutch East India company, and partly by other accidents, they carried on for many years a successful trade. But in process of time, when the principles of liberty were better understood, it became every day more and more doubtful, how far a royal charter, not confirmed by act of parliament, could convey an exclusive privilege. Upon this question the decisions of the courts of justice were not uniform, but varied with the authority of government, and the humours of the times. Interlopers multiplied upon them; and towards the end of the reign of Charles II., through the whole of that of James II., and during a part of that of William III., reduced them to great distress. In 1698, a proposal was made to parliament, of advancing two millions to government, at eight per cent. provided the subscribers were erected into a new East India company, with exclusive privileges. The old East India company offered seven hundred thousand pounds, nearly the amount of their capital, at four per cent. upon the same conditions. But such was at that time the state of public credit, that it was more convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight per cent. than seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The proposal of the new subscribers was accepted, and a new East India company established in consequence. The old East India company, however, had a right to continue their trade till 1701. They had, at the same time, in the name of their treasurer, subscribed very artfully three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds into the stock of the new. By a negligence in the expression of the act of parliament, which vested the East India trade in the subscribers to this loan of two millions, it did not appear evident that they were all obliged to unite into a joint stock. A few private traders, whose subscriptions amounted only to seven thousand two hundred pounds, insisted upon the privilege of trading separately upon their own stocks, and at their own risks. The old East India company had a right to a separate trade upon their own stock till 1701; and they had likewise, both before and after that period, a right, like that or other private traders, to a separate trade upon the \u00a3315,000, which they had subscribed into the stock of the new company. The competition of the two companies with the private traders, and with one another, is said to have well nigh ruined both. Upon a subsequent occasion, in 1750, when a proposal was made to parliament for putting the trade under the management of a regulated company, and thereby laying it in some measure open, the East India company, in opposition to this proposal, represented, in very strong terms, what had been, at this time, the miserable effects, as they thought them, of this competition. In India, they said, it raised the price of goods so high, that they were not worth the buying; and in England, by overstocking the market, it sunk their price so low, that no profit could be made by them. That by a more plentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency of the public, it must have reduced very much the price of India goods in the English market, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have raised very much their price in the Indian market, seems not very probable, as all the extraordinary demand which that competition could occasion must have been but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian commerce. The increase of demand, besides, though in the beginning it may sometimes raise the price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long-run. It encourages production, and thereby increases the competition of the producers, who, in order to undersell one another, have recourse to new divisions or labour and new improvements of art, which might never otherwise have been thought of. The miserable effects of which the company complained, were the cheapness of consumption, and the encouragement given to production; precisely the two effects which it is the great business of political economy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave this doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In 1702, the two companies were, in some measure, united by an indenture tripartite, to which the queen was the third party; and in 1708, they were by act of parliament, perfectly consolidated into one company, by their present name of the United Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies. Into this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause, allowing the separate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas 1711; but at the same time empowering the directors, upon three years notice, to redeem their little capital of seven thousand two hundred pounds, and thereby to convert the whole stock of the company into a joint stock. By the same act, the capital of the company, in consequence of a new loan to government, was augmented from two millions to three millions two hundred thousand pounds. In 1743, the company advanced another million to government. But this million being raised, not by a call upon the proprietors, but by selling annuities and contracting bond-debts, it did not augment the stock upon which the proprietors could claim a dividend. It augmented, however, their trading stock, it being equally liable with the other three millions two hundred thousand pounds, to the losses sustained, and debts contracted by the company in prosecution of their mercantile projects. From 1708, or at least from 1711, this company, being delivered from all competitors, and fully established in the monopoly of the English commerce to the East Indies, carried on a successful trade, and from their profits, made annually a moderate dividend to their proprietors. During the French war, which began in 1741, the ambition of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, involved them in the wars of the Carnatic, and in the politics of the Indian princes. After many signal successes, and equally signal losses, they at last lost Madras, at that time their principal settlement in India. It was restored to them by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and, about this time the spirit of war and conquest seems to have taken possession of their servants in India, and never since to have left them. During the French war, which began in 1755, their arms partook of the general good fortune of those of Great Britain. They defended Madras, took Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired the revenues of a rich and extensive territory, amounting, it was then said, to upwards of three millions a-year. They remained for several years in quiet possession of this revenue; but in 1767, administration laid claim to their territorial acquisitions, and the revenue arising from them, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company, in compensation for this claim, agreed to pay to government \u00a3400,000 a-year. They had, before this, gradually augmented their dividend from about six to ten per cent.; that is, upon their capital of three millions two hundred thousand pounds, they had increased it by \u00a3128,000, or had raised it from one hundred and ninety-two thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand pounds a-year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still further, to twelve and a-half per cent., which would have made their annual payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay annually to government, or to \u00a3400,000 a-year. But during the two years in which their agreement with government was to take place, they were restrained from any further increase of dividend by two successive acts of parliament, of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier progress in the payment of their debts, which were at this time estimated at upwards of six or seven millions sterling. In 1769, they renewed their agreement with government for five years more, and stipulated, that during the course of that period, they should be allowed gradually to increase their dividend to twelve and a-half per cent; never increasing it, however, more than one per cent. in one year. This increase of dividend, therefore, when it had risen to its utmost height, could augment their annual payments, to their proprietors and government together, but by \u00a3680,000, beyond what they had been before their late territorial acquisitions. What the gross revenue of those territorial acquisitions was supposed to amount to, has already been mentioned; and by an account brought by the Cruttenden East Indiaman in 1769, the neat revenue, clear of all deductions and military charges, was stated at two millions forty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-seven pounds. They were said, at the same time, to possess another revenue, arising partly from lands, but chiefly from the customs established at their different settlements, amounting to \u00a3439,000. The profits of their trade, too, according to the evidence of their chairman before the house of commons, amounted, at this time, to at least \u00a3400,000 a-year; according to that of their accountant, to at least \u00a3500,000; according to the lowest account, at least equal to the highest dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors. So great a revenue might certainly have afforded an augmentation of \u00a3680,000 in their annual payments; and, at the same time, have left a large sinking fund, sufficient for the speedy reduction of their debt. In 1773, however, their debts, instead of being reduced, were augmented by an arrear to the treasury in the payment of the four hundred thousand pounds; by another to the custom-house for duties unpaid; by a large debt to the bank, for money borrowed; and by a fourth, for bills drawn upon them from India, and wantonly accepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand pounds. The distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them, obliged them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per cent. but to throw themselves upon the mercy of govermnent, and to supplicate, first, a release from the further payment of the stipulated \u00a3400,000 a-year; and, secondly, a loan of fourteen hundred thousand, to save them from immediate bankruptcy. The great increase of their fortune had, it seems, only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for greater profusion, and a cover for greater malversation, than in proportion even to that increase of fortune. The conduct of their servants in India, and the general state of their affairs both in India and in Europe, became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry: in consequence of which, several very important alterations were made in the constitution of their government, both at home and abroad. In India, their principal settlements or Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, which had before been altogether independent of one another, were subjected to a governor-general, assisted by a council of four assessors, parliament assuming to itself the first nomination of this governor and council, who were to reside at Calcutta; that city having now become, what Madras was before, the most important of the English settlements in India. The court of the Mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted for the trial of mercantile causes, which arose in the city and neighbourhood, had gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire. It was now reduced and confined to the original purpose of its institution. Instead of it, a new supreme court of judicature was established, consisting of a chief justice and three judges, to be appointed by the crown. In Europe, the qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to vote at their general courts was raised, from five hundred pounds, the original price of a share in the stock of the company, to a thousand pounds. In order to vote upon this qualification, too, it was declared necessary, that he should have possessed it, if acquired by his own purchase, and not by inheritance, for at least one year, instead of six months, the term requisite before. The court of twenty-four directors had before been chosen annually; but it was now enacted, that each director should, for the future, be chosen for four years; six of them, however, to go out of office by rotation every year, and not be capable of being re-chosen at the election of the six new directors for the ensuing year. In consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the proprietors and directors, it was expected, would be likely to act with more dignity and steadiness than they had usually done before. But it seems impossible, by any alterations, to render those courts, in any respect, fit to govern, or even to share in the government of a great empire; because the greater part of their members must always have too little interest in the prosperity of that empire, to give any serious attention to what may promote it. Frequently a man of great, sometimes even a man of small fortune, is willing to purchase a thousand pounds share in India stock, merely for the influence which he expects to aquire by a vote in the court of proprietors. It gives him a share, though not in the plunder, yet in the appointment of the plunderers of India; the court of directors, though they make that appointment, being necessarily more or less under the influence of the proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but sometimes over-rule the appointments of their servants in India. Provided he can enjoy this influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a certain number of his friends, he frequently cares little about the dividend, or even about the value of the stock upon which his vote is founded. About the prosperity of the great empire, in the government of which that vote gives him a share, he seldom cares at all. No other sovereigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects, the improvement or waste of their dominions, the glory or disgrace of their administration, as, from irresistible moral causes, the greater part of the proprietors of such a mercantile company are, and necessarily must be. This indifference, too, was more likely to be increased than diminished by some of the new regulations which were made in consequence of the parliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the house of commons, for example, it was declared, that when the \u00a31,400,000 lent to the company by government, should be paid, and their bond-debts be reduced to \u00a31,500,000, they might then, and not till then, divide eight per cent. upon their capital; and that whatever remained of their revenues and neat profits at home should be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the exchequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a fund, either for the further reduction of their bond-debts, or for the discharge of other contingent exigencies which the company might labour under. But if the company were bad stewards and bad sovereigns, when the whole of their neat revenue and profits belonged to themselves, and were at their own disposal, they were surely not likely to be better when three-fourths of them were to belong to other people, and the other fourth, though to be laid out for the benefit of the company, yet to be so under the inspection and with the approbation of other people.\n\nIt might be more agreeable to the company, that their own servants and dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting, or the profit of embezzling, whatever surplus might remain, after paying the proposed dividend of eight per cent. than that it should come into the hands of a set of people with whom those resolutions could scarce fail to set them in some measure at variance. The interest of those servants and dependants might so far predominate in the court of proprietors, as sometimes to dispose it to support the authors of depredations which had been committed in direct violation of its own authority. With the majority of proprietors, the support even of the authority of their own court might sometimes be a matter of less consequence than the support of those who had set that authority at defiance.\n\nThe regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the disorder of the company's government in India. Notwithstanding that, during a momentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected into the treasury of Calcutta more than \u00a33,000,000 sterling; notwithstanding that they had afterwards extended either their dominion or their depredations over a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile countries in India, all was wasted and destroyed. They found themselves altogether unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of Hyder Ali; and in consequence of those disorders, the company is now (1784) in greater distress than ever; and, in order to prevent immediate bankruptcy, is once more reduced to supplicate the assistance of government. Different plans have been proposed by the different parties in parliament for the better management of its affairs; and all those plans seem to agree in supposing, what was indeed always abundantly evident, that it is altogether unfit to govern its territorial possessions. Even the company itself seems to be convinced of its own incapacity so far, and seems, upon that account willing to give them up to government.\n\nWith the right of possessing forts and garrisons in distant and barbarous countries is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war in those countries. The joint-stock companies, which have had the one right, have constantly exercised the other, and have frequently had it expressly conferred upon them. How unjustly, how capriciously, how cruelly, they have commonly exercised it, is too well known from recent experience.\n\nWhen a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and expense, to establish a new trade with some remote and barbarous nation, it may not be unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint-stock company, and to grant them, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years. It is the easiest and most natural way in which the state can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment, of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated, upon the same principles upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new book to its author. But upon the expiration of the term, the monopoly ought certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it was found necessary to establish any, to be taken into the hands of government, their value to be paid to the company, and the trade to be laid open to all the subjects of the state. By a perpetual monopoly, all the other subjects of the state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways: first, by the high price of goods, which, in the case of a free trade, they could buy much cheaper; and, secondly, by their total exclusion from a branch of business which it might be both convenient and profitable for many of them to carry on. It is for the most worthless of all purposes, too, that they are taxed in this manner. It is merely to enable the company to support the negligence, profusion, and malversation of their own servants, whose disorderly conduct seldom allows the dividend of the company to exceed the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are altogether free, and very frequently makes a fall even a good deal short of that rate. Without a monopoly, however, a joint-stock company, it would appear from experience, cannot long carry on any branch of foreign trade. To buy in one market, in order to sell with profit in another, when there are many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occasional variations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent variations in the competition, or in the supply which that demand is likely to get from other people; and to suit with dexterity and judgment both the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these circumstances, is a species of warfare, of which the operations are continually changing, and which can scarce ever be conducted successfully, without such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and attention as cannot long be expected from the directors of a joint-stock company. The East India company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of their exclusive privilege, have a right, by act of parliament, to continue a corporation with a joint stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity to the East Indies, in common with the rest of their fellow subjects. But in this situation, the superior vigilance and attention of a private adventurer would, in all probability, soon make them weary of the trade.\n\nAn eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political economy, the Abbe Morellet, gives a list of fifty-five joint-stock companies for foreign trade, which have been established in different parts of Europe since the year 1600, and which, according to him, have all failed from mismanagement, notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges. He has been misinformed with regard to the history of two or three of them, which were not joint-stock companies and have not failed. But, in compensation, there have been several joint-stock companies which have failed, and which he has omitted.\nThe only trades which it seems possible for a joint-stock company to carry on successfully, without an exclusive privilege, are those, of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine, or to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of this kind is, first, the banking trade; secondly, the trade of insurance from fire and from sea risk, and capture in time of war; thirdly, the trade of making and maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly, the similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city.\n\nThough the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat abstruse, the practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules. To depart upon any occasion from those rules, in consequence of some flattering speculation of extraordinary gain, is almost always extremely dangerous and frequently fatal to the banking company which attempts it. But the constitution of joint-stock companies renders them in general, more tenacious of established rules than any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, seem extremely well fitted for this trade. The principal banking companies in Europe, accordingly, are joint-stock companies, many of which manage their trade very successfully without any exclusive privilege. The bank of England has no other exclusive privilege, except that no other banking company in England shall consist of more than six persons. The two banks of Edinburgh are joint-stock companies, without any exclusive privilege.\n\nThe value of the risk, either from fire, or from loss by sea, or by capture, though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits, however, of such a gross estimation, as renders it, in some degree, reducible to strict rule and method. The trade of insurance, therefore, may be carried on successfully by a joint-stock company, without any exclusive privilege. Neither the London Assurance, nor the Royal Exchange Assurance companies have any such privilege.\n\nWhen a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management of it becomes quite simple and easy, and it is reducible to strict rule and method. Even the making of it is so, as it may be contracted for with undertakers, at so much a mile, and so much a lock. The same thing may be said of a canal, an aqueduct, or a great pipe for bringing water to supply a great city. Such under-takings, therefore, may be, and accordingly frequently are, very successfully managed by joint-stock companies, without any exclusive privilege.\n\nTo establish a joint-stock company, however, for any undertaking, merely because such a company might be capable of managing it successfully; or, to exempt a particular set of dealers from some of the general laws which take place with regard to all their neighbours, merely because they might be capable of thriving, if they had such an exemption, would certainly not be reasonable. To render such an establishment perfectly reasonable, with the circumstance of being reducible to strict rule and method, two other circumstances ought to concur. First, it ought to appear with the clearest evidence, that the undertaking is of greater and more general utility than the greater part of common trades; and, secondly, that it requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into a private copartnery. If a moderate capital were sufficient, the great utility of the undertaking would not be a sufficient reason for establishing a joint-stock company; because, in this case, the demand for what it was to produce, would readily and easily be supplied by private adventurers. In the four trades above mentioned, both those circumstances concur.\n\nThe great and general utility of the banking trade, when prudently managed, has been fully explained in the second book of this Inquiry. But a public bank, which is to support public credit, and, upon particular emergencies, to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to the amount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before it comes in, requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private copartnery.\n\nThe trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private people, and, by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin an individual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In order to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should have a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint-stock companies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the attorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private usurers, who had failed in the course of a few years.\n\nThat navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes necessary for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general utility, while, at the same time, they frequently require a greater expense than suits the fortunes of private people, is sufficiently obvious.\n\nExcept the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to recollect any other, in which all the three circumstances requisite for rendering reasonable the establishment of a joint-stock company concur. The English copper company of London, the lead-smelting company, the glass-grinding company, have not even the pretext of any great or singular utility in the object which they pursue; nor does the pursuit of that object seem to require any expense unsuitable to the fortunes of many private men. Whether the trade which those companies carry on, is reducible to such strict rule and method as to render it fit for the management of a joint-stock company, or whether they have any reason to boast of their extraordinary profits, I do not pretend to know. The mine-adventurers company has been long ago bankrupt. A share in the stock of the British Linen company of Edinburgh sells, at present, very much below par, though less so than it did some years ago. The joint-stock companies, which are established for the public-spirited purpose of promoting some particular manufacture, over and above managing their own affairs ill, to the diminution of the general stock of the society, can, in other respects, scarce ever fail to do more harm than good. Notwithstanding the most upright intentions, the unavoidable partiality of their directors to particular branches of the manufacture, of which the undertakers mislead and impose upon them, is a real discouragement to the rest, and necessarily breaks, more or less, that natural proportion which would otherwise establish itself between judicious industry and profit, and which, to the general industry of the country, is of all encouragements the greatest and the most effectual.\nART. II.\u2014Of the Expense of the Institution for the Education of Youth.\n\nThe institutions for the education of the youth may, in the same manner, furnish a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expense. The fee or honorary, which the scholar pays to the master, naturally constitutes a revenue of this kind.\nEven where the reward of the master does not arise altogether from this natural revenue, it still is not necessary that it should be derived from that general revenue of the society, of which the collection and application are, in most countries, assigned to the executive power. Through the greater part of Europe, accordingly, the endowment of schools and colleges makes either no charge upon that general revenue, or but a very small one. It everywhere arises chiefly from some local or provincial revenue, from the rent of some landed estate, or from the interest of some sum of money, allotted and put under the management of trustees for this particular purpose, sometimes by the sovereign himself, and sometimes by some private donor.\nHave those public endowments contributed in general, to promote the end of their institution? Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers? Have they directed the course of education towards objects more useful, both to the individual and to the public, than those to which it would naturally have gone of its own accord? It should not seem very difficult to give at least a probable answer to each of those questions.\n\nIn every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who exercise it, is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of making that exertion. This necessity is greatest with those to whom the emoluments of their profession are the only source from which they expect their fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence. In order to acquire this fortune, or even to get this subsistence, they must, in the course of a year, execute a certain quantity of work of a known value; and, where the competition is free, the rivalship of competitors, who are all endeavouring to justle one another out of employment, obliges every man to endeavour to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness. The greatness of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some particular professions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertions of a few men of extraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are evidently not necessary, in order to occasion the greatest exertions. Rivalship and emulation render excellency, even in mean professions, an object of ambition, and frequently occasion the very greatest exertions. Great objects, on the contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of application, have seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable exertion. In England, success in the profession of the law leads to some very great objects of ambition; and yet how few men, born to easy fortunes, have ever in this country been eminent in that profession?\nThe endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished, more or less, the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence, so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund, altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions.\n\nIn some universities, the salary makes but a part, and frequently but a small part, of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part arises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of application, though always more or less diminished, is not, in this case, entirely taken away. Reputation in his profession is still of some importance to him, and he still has some dependency upon the affection, gratitude, and favourable report of those who have attended upon his instructions; and these favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no way so well as by deserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence with which he discharges every part of his duty.\n\nIn other universities, the teacher is prohibited from receiving any honorary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of the revenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this case, set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it. It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can; and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same, whether he does or does not perform some very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest, at least as interest is vulgarly understood, either to neglect it altogether, or, if he is subject to some authority which will not suffer him to do this, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner as that authority will permit. If he is naturally active and a lover of labour, it is his interest to employ that activity in any way from which he can derive some advantage, rather than in the performance of his duty, from which he can derive none.\n\nIf the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate, the college, or university, of which he himself is a member, and in which the greater part of the other members are, like himself, persons who either are, or ought to be teachers, they are likely to make a common cause, to be all very indulgent to one another, and every man to consent that his neighbour may neglect his duty, provided he himself is allowed to neglect his own. In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\n\nIf the authority to which he is subject resides, not so much in the body corporate, of which he is a member, as in some other extraneous persons, in the bishop of the diocese, for example, in the governor of the province, or, perhaps, in some minister of state, it is not, indeed, in this case, very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty altogether. All that such superiors, however, can force him to do, is to attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a certain number of lectures in the week, or in the year. What those lectures shall be, must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher; and that diligence is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he has for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of this kind, besides, is liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously. In its nature, it is arbitrary and discretionary; and the persons who exercise it, neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor perhaps understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach, are seldom capable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of office, too, they are frequently indifferent how they exercise it, and are very apt to censure or deprive him of his office wantonly and without any just cause. The person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by it, and, instead of being one of the most respectable, is rendered one of the meanest and most contemptible persons in the society. It is by powerful protection only, that he can effectually guard himself against the bad usage to which he is at all times exposed; and this protection he is most likely to gain, not by ability or diligence in his profession, but by obsequiousness to the will of his superiors, and by being ready, at all times, to sacrifice to that will the rights, the interest, and the honour of the body corporate, of which he is a member. Whoever has attended for any considerable time to the administration of a French university, must have had occasion to remark the effects which naturally result from an arbitrary and extraneous jurisdiction of this kind.\n\nWhatever forces a certain number of students to any college or university, independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers, tends more or less to diminish the necessity of that merit or reputation.\n\nThe privileges of graduates in arts, in law, physic, and divinity, when they can be obtained only by residing a certain number of years in certain universities, necessarily force a certain number of students to such universities, independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers. The privileges of graduates are a sort of statutes of apprenticeship, which have contributed to the improvement of education just as the other statutes of apprenticeship have to that of arts and manufactures.\n\nThe charitable foundations of scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, etc. necessarily attach a certain number of students to certain colleges, independent altogether of the merit of those particular colleges. Were the students upon such charitable foundations left free to choose what college they liked best, such liberty might perhaps contribute to excite some emulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which prohibited even the independent members of every particular college from leaving it, and going to any other, without leave first asked and obtained of that which they meant to abandon, would tend very much to extinguish that emulation.\n\nIf in each college, the tutor or teacher, who was to instruct each student in all arts and sciences, should not be voluntarily chosen by the student, but appointed by the head of the college; and if, in case of neglect, inability, or bad usage, the student should not be allowed to change him for another, without leave first asked and obtained; such a regulation would not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the different tutors of the same college, but to diminish very much, in all of them, the necessity of diligence and of attention to their respective pupils. Such teachers, though very well paid by their students, might be as much disposed to neglect them, as those who are not paid by them at all or who have no other recompense but their salary.\n\nIf the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing to his students, that he is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better than nonsense. It must, too, be unpleasant to him to observe, that the greater part of his students desert his lectures; or perhaps, attend upon them with plain enough marks of neglect, contempt, and derision. If he is obliged, therefore, to give a certain number of lectures, these motives alone, without any other interest, might dispose him to take some pains to give tolerably good ones. Several different expedients, however, may be fallen upon, which will effectually blunt the edge of all those incitements to diligence. The teacher, instead of explaining to his pupils himself the science in which he proposes to instruct them, may read some book upon it; and if this book is written in a foreign and dead language, by interpreting it to them into their own, or, what would give him still less trouble, by making them interpret it to him, and by now and then making an occasional remark upon it, he may flatter himself that he is giving a lecture. The slightest degree of knowledge and application will enable him to do this, without exposing himself to contempt or derision, by saying any thing that is really foolish, absurd, or ridiculous. The discipline of the college, at the same time, may enable him to force all his pupils to the most regular attendance upon his sham lecture, and to maintain the most decent and respectful behaviour during the whole time of the performance.\n\nThe discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not for the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or, more properly speaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all cases, to maintain the authority of the master, and, whether he neglects or performs his duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the greatest weakness and folly in the other. Where the masters, however, really perform their duty, there are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the students ever neglect theirs. No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending, as is well known wherever any such lectures are given. Force and restraint may, no doubt, be in some degree requisite, in order to oblige children, or very young boys, to attend to those parts of education, which it is thought necessary for them to acquire during that early period of life; but after twelve or thirteen years of age, provided the master does his duty, force or restraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part of education. Such is the generosity of the greater part of young men, that so far from being disposed to neglect or despise the instructions of their master, provided he shews some serious intention of being of use to them, they are generally inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectness in the performance of his duty, and sometimes even to conceal from the public a good deal of gross negligence.\n\nThose parts of education, it is to be observed, for the teaching of which there are no public institutions, are generally the best taught. When a young man goes to a fencing or a dancing school, he does not, indeed, always learn to fence or to dance very well; but he seldom fails of learning to fence or to dance. The good effects of the riding school are not commonly so evident. The expense of a riding school is so great, that in most places it is a public institution. The three most essential parts of literary education, to read, write, and account, it still continues to be more common to acquire in private than in public schools; and it very seldom happens, that anybody fails of acquiring them to the degree in which it is necessary to acquire them.\n\nIn England, the public schools are much less corrupted than the universities. In the schools, the youth are taught, or at least may be taught, Greek and Latin; that is, everything which the masters pretend to teach, or which it is expected they should teach. In the universities, the youth neither are taught, nor always can find any proper means of being taught the sciences, which it is the business of those incorporated bodies to teach. The reward of the schoolmaster, in most cases, depends principally, in some cases almost entirely, upon the fees or honoraries of his scholars. Schools have no exclusive privileges. In order to obtain the honours of graduation, it is not necessary that a person should bring a certificate of his having studied a certain number of years at a public school. If, upon examination, he appears to understand what is taught there, no questions are asked about the place where he learnt it.\n\nThe parts of education which are commonly taught in universities, it may perhaps be said, are not very well taught. But had it not been for those institutions, they would not have been commonly taught at all; and both the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from the want of those important parts of education.\n\nThe present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of them, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of churchmen. They were founded by the authority of the pope; and were so entirely under his immediate protection, that their members, whether masters or students, had all of them what was then called the benefit of clergy, that is, were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the countries in which their respective universities were situated, and were amenable only to the ecclesiastical tribunals. What was taught in the greater part of those universities was suitable to the end of their institution, either theology, or something that was merely preparatory to theology.\n\nWhen Christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had become the common language of all the western parts of Europe. The service of the church, accordingly, and the translation of the Bible which were read in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is, in the common language of the country, After the irruption of the barbarous nations who overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the language of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally preserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the circumstances which first introduced and rendered them reasonable, are no more. Though Latin, therefore, was no longer understood anywhere by the great body of the people, the whole service of the church still continued to be performed in that language. Two different languages were thus established in Europe, in the same manner as in ancient Egypt: a language of the priests, and a language of the people; a sacred and a profane, a learned and an unlearned language. But it was necessary that the priests should understand something of that sacred and learned language in which they were to officiate; and the study of the Latin language therefore made, from the beginning, an essential part of university education.\n\nIt was not so with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language. The infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin translation of the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have been equally dictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal authority with the Greek and Hebrew originals. The knowledge of those two languages, therefore, not being indispensably requisite to a churchman, the study of them did not for along time make a necessary part of the common course of university education. There are some Spanish universities, I am assured, in which the study of the Greek language has never yet made any part of that course. The first reformers found the Greek text of the New Testament, and even the Hebrew text of the Old, more favourable to their opinions than the vulgate translation, which, as might naturally be supposed, had been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the Catholic Church. They set themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors of that translation, which the Roman catholic clergy were thus put under the necessity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done without some knowledge of the original languages, of which the study was therefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities; both of those which embraced, and of those which rejected, the doctrines of the reformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that classical learning, which, though at first principally cultivated by catholics and Italians, happened to come into fashion much about the same time that the doctrines of the reformation were set on foot. In the greater part of universities, therefore, that language was taught previous to the study of philosophy, and as soon as the student had made some progress in the Latin. The Hebrew language having no connection with classical learning, and, except the Holy Scriptures, being the language of not a single book in any esteem the study of it did not commonly commence till after that of philosophy, and when the student had entered upon the study of theology.\n\nOriginally, the first rudiments, both of the Greek and Latin languages, were taught in universities; and in some universities they still continue to be so. In others, it is expected that the student should have previously acquired, at least, the rudiments of one or both of those languages, of which the study continues to make everywhere a very considerable part of university education.\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches; physics, or natural philosophy; ethics, or moral philosophy; and logic. This general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.\n\nThe great phenomena of nature, the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, eclipses, comets; thunder and lightning, and other extraordinary meteors; the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals; are objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they naturally call forth the curiosity of mankind to inquire into their causes. Superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with, than the agency of the gods. As those great phenomena are the first objects of human curiosity, so the science which pretends to explain them must naturally have been the first branch of philosophy that was cuitivated. The first philosophers, accordingly, of whom history has preserved any account, appear to have been natural philosophers.\n\nIn every age and country of the world, men must have attended to the characters, designs, and actions of one another; and many reputable rules and maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and approved of by common consent. As soon as writing came into fashion, wise men, or those who fancied themselves such, would naturally endeavour to increase the number of those established and respected maxims, and to express their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct, sometimes in the more artificial form of apologues, like what are called the fables of Aesop; and sometimes in the more simple one of apophthegms or wise sayings, like the proverbs of Solomon, the verses of Theognis and Phocyllides, and some part of the works of Hesiod. They might continue in this manner, for a long time, merely to multiply the number of those maxims of prudence and morality, without even attempting to arrange them in any very distinct or methodical order, much less to connect them together by one or more general principles, from which they were all deducible, like effects from their natural causes. The beauty of a systematical arrangement of different observations, connected by a few common principles, was first seen in the rude essays of those ancient times towards a system of natural philosophy. Something of the same kind was afterwards attempted in morals. The maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical order, and connected together by a few common principles, in the same manner as they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of nature. The science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting principles, is what is properly called Moral Philosophy.\n\nDifferent authors gave different systems, both of natural and moral philosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different systems, far from being always demonstrations, were frequently at best but very slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had no other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language. Speculative systems, have, in all ages of the world, been adopted for reasons too frivolous to have determined the judgment of any man of common sense, in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross sophistry has scarce ever had any influence upon the opinions of mankind, except in matters of philosophy and speculation; and in these it has frequently had the greatest. The patrons of each system of natural and moral philosophy, naturally endeavoured to expose the weakness of the arguments adduced to support the systems which were opposite to their own. In examining those arguments, they were necessarily led to consider the difference between a probable and a demonstrative argument, between a fallacious and a conclusive one; and logic, or the science of the general principles of good and bad reasoning, necessarily arose out of the observations which a scrutiny of this kind gave occasion to; though, in its origin, posterior both to physics and to ethics, it was commonly taught, not indeed in all, but in the greater part of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously to either of those sciences. The student, it seems to have been thought, ought to understand well the difference between good and bad reasoning, before he was led to reason upon subjects of so great importance.\n\nThis ancient division of philosophy into three parts was, in the greater part of the universities of Europe, changed for another into five.\n\nIn the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature either of the human mind or of the Deity, made a part of the system of physics. Those beings, in whatever their essence might be supposed to consist, were parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too, productive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could either conclude or conjecture concerning them, made, as it were, two chapters, though no doubt two very important ones, of the science which pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great system of the universe. But in the universities of Europe, where philosophy was taught only as subservient to theology, it was natural to dwell longer upon these two chapters than upon any other of the science. They were gradually more and more extended, and were divided into many inferior chapters; till at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so little can be known, came to take up as much room in the system of philosophy as the doctrine of bodies, of which so much can be known. The doctrines concerning those two subjects were considered as making two distinct sciences. What are called metaphysics, or pneumatics, were set in opposition to physics, and were cultivated not only as the more sublime, but, for the purposes of a particular profession, as the more useful science of the two. The proper subject of experiment and observation, a subject in which a careful attention is capable of making so many useful discoveries, was almost entirely neglected. The subject in which, after a very few simple and almost obvious truths, the most careful attention can discover nothing but obscurity and uncertainty, and can consequently produce nothing but subtleties and sophisms, was greatly cultivated.\n\nWhen those two sciences had thus been set in opposition to one another, the comparison between them naturally gave birth to a third, to what was called ontology, or the science which treated of the qualities and attributes which were common to both the subjects of the other two sciences. But if subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the metaphysics or pneumatics of the schools, they composed the whole of this cobweb science of ontology, which was likewise sometimes called metaphysics.\nWherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man, considered not only as an individual, but as the member of a family, of a state, and of the great society of mankind, was the object which the ancient moral philosophy proposed to investigate. In that philosophy, the duties of human life were treated of as subservient to the happiness and perfection of human life, But when moral, as well as natural philosophy, came to be taught only as subservient to theology, the duties of human life were treated of as chiefly subservient to the happiness of a life to come. In the ancient philosophy, the perfection of virtue was represented as necessarily productive, to the person who possessed it, of the most perfect happiness in this life. In the modern philosophy, it was frequently represented as generally, or rather as almost always, inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and heaven was to be earned only by penance and mortification, by the austerities and abasement of a monk, not by the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct of a man. Casuistry, and an ascetic morality, made up, in most cases, the greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the most important of all the different branches of philosophy became in this manner by far the most corrupted.\n\nSuch, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education in the greater part of the universities in Europe. Logic was taught first; ontology came in the second place; pneumatology, comprehending the doctrine concerning the nature of the human soul and of the Deity, in the third; in the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy, which was considered as immediately connected with the doctrines of pneumatology, with the immortality of the human soul, and with the rewards and punishments which, from the justice of the Deity, were to be expected in a life to come: a short and superficial system of physics usually concluded the course.\n\nThe alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced into the ancient course of philosophy were all meant for the education of ecclesiastics, and to render it a more proper introduction to the study of theology. But the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry, the casuistry and ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it, certainly did not render it more for the education of gentlemen or men of the world, or more likely either to improve the understanding or to mend the heart.\n\nThis course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the greater part of the universities of Europe, with more or less diligence, according as the constitution of each particular university happens to render diligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In some of the richest and best endowed universities, the tutors content themselves with teaching a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course; and even these they commonly teach very negligently and superficially.\nThe improvements which, in modern times have been made in several different branches of philosophy, have not, the greater part of them, been made in universities, though some, no doubt, have. The greater part of universities have not even been very forward to adopt those improvements after they were made; and several of those learned societies have chosen to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems and obsolete prejudices found shelter and protection, after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the world. In general, the richest and best endowed universities have been slowest in adopting those improvements, and the most averse to permit any considerable change in the established plan of education. Those improvements were more easily introduced into some of the poorer universities, in which the teachers, depending upon their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence, were obliged to pay more attention to the current opinions of the world.\nBut though the public schools and universities of Europe were originally intended only for the education of a particular profession, that of churchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing their pupils, even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that profession; yet they gradually drew to themselves the education of almost all other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune. No better method, it seems, could be fallen upon, of spending, with any advantage, the long interval between infancy and that period of life at which men begin to apply in good earnest to the real business of the world, the business which is to employ them during the remainder of their days. The greater part of what is taught in schools and universities, however, does not seem to be the most proper preparation for that business.\n\nIn England, it becomes every day more and more the custom to send young people to travel in foreign countries immediately upon their leaving school, and without sending them to any university. Our young people, it is said, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young man, who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one-and-twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went abroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in three or four years. In the course of his travels, he generally acquires some knowledge of one or two foreign languages; a knowledge, however, which is seldom sufficient to enable him either to speak or write them with propriety. In other respects, he commonly returns home more conceited, more unprincipled, more dissipated, and more incapable of my serious application, either to study or to business, than he could well have become in so short a time had he lived at home. By travelling so very young, by spending in the most frivolous dissipation the most previous years of his life, at a distance from the inspection and control of his parents and relations, every useful habit, which the earlier parts of his education might have had some tendency to form in him, instead of being riveted and confirmed, is almost necessarily either weakened or effaced. Nothing but the discredit into which the universities are allowing themselves to fall, could ever have brought into repute so very absurd a practice as that of travelling at this early period of life. By sending his son abroad, a father delivers himself, at least for some time, from so disagreeable an object as that of a son unemployed, neglected, and going to ruin before his eyes.\n\nSuch have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for education.\n\nDifferent plans and different institutions for education seem to have taken place in other ages and nations.\nIn the republics of ancient Greece, every free citizen was instructed, under the direction of the public magistrate, in gymnastic exercises and in music. By gymnastic exercises, it was intended to harden his body, to sharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of war; and as the Greek militia was, by all accounts, one of the best that ever was in the world, this part of their public education must have answered completely the purpose for which it was intended. By the other part, music, it was proposed, at least by the philosophers and historians, who have given us an account of those institutions, to humanize the mind, to soften the temper, and to dispose it for performing all the social and moral duties of public and private life.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose as those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece, and they seem to have answered it equally well. But among the Romans there was nothing which corresponded to the musical education of the Greeks. The morals of the Romans, however, both in private and public life, seem to have been, not only equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal superior to those of the Greeks. That they were superior in private life, we have the express testimony of Polybius, and of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, two authors well acquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor of the Greek and Roman history bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the Romans. The good temper and moderation of contending factions seem to be the most essential circumstances in the public morals of a free people. But the factions of the Greeks were almost always violent and sanguinary; whereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any Roman faction; and from the time of the Gracchi, the Roman republic may be considered as in reality dissolved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the very respectable authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius, and notwithstanding the very ingenious reasons by which Mr. Montesquieu endeavours to support that authority, it seems probable that the musical education of the Greeks had no great effect in mending their morals, since, without any such education, those of the Romans were, upon the whole, superior. The respect of those ancient sages for the institutions of their ancestors had probably disposed them to find much political wisdom in what was, perhaps, merely an ancient custom, continued, without interruption, from the earliest period of those societies, to the times in which they had arrived at a considerable degree of refinement. Music and dancing are the great amusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the great accomplishments which are supposed to fit any man for entertaining his society. It is so at this day among the negroes on the coast of Africa. It was so among the ancient Celtes, among the ancient Scandinavians, and, as we may learn from Homer, among the ancient Greeks, in the times preceding the Trojan war. When the Greek tribes had formed themselves into little republics, it was natural that the study of those accomplishments should for a long time make a part of the public and common education of the people.\n\nThe masters who instructed the young people, either in music or in military exercises, do not seem to have been paid, or even appointed by the state, either in Rome or even at Athens, the Greek republic of whose laws and customs we are the best informed. The state required that every free citizen should fit himself for defending it in war, and should upon that account, learn his military exercises. But it left him to learn them of such masters as he could find; and it seems to have advanced nothing for this purpose, but a public field or place of exercise, in which he should practise and perform them.\n\nIn the early ages, both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other parts of education seem to have consisted in learning to read, write, and account, according to the arithmetic of the times. These accomplishments the richer citizens seem frequently to have acquired at home, by the assistance of some domestic pedagogue, who was, generally, either a slave or a freedman; and the poorer citizens in the schools of such masters as made a trade of teaching for hire. Such parts of education, however, were abandoned altogether to the care of the parents or guardians of each individual. It does not appear that the state ever assumed any inspection or direction of them. By a law of Solon, indeed, the children were acquitted from maintaining those parents who had neglected to instruct them in some profitable trade or business.\n\nIn the progress of refinement, when philosophy and rhetoric came into fashion, the better sort of people used to send their children to the schools of philosophers and rhetoricians, in order to be instructed in these fashionable sciences. But those schools were not supported by the public. They were, for a long time, barely tolerated by it. The demand for philosophy and rhetoric was, for a long time, so small, that the first professed teachers of either could not find constant employment in any one city, but were obliged to travel about from place to place. In this manner lived Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, and many others. As the demand increased, the school, both of philosophy and rhetoric, became stationary, first in Athens, and afterwards in several other cities. The state, however, seems never to have encouraged them further, than by assigning to some of them a particular place to teach in, which was sometimes done, too, by private donors. The state seems to have assigned the Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to Aristotle, and the Portico to Zeno of Citta, the founder of the Stoics. But Epicurus bequeathed his gardens to his own school. Till about the time of Marcus Antoninus, however, no teacher appears to have had any salary from the public, or to have had any other emoluments, but what arose from the honorarius or fees of his scholars. The bounty which that philosophical emperor, as we learn from Lucian, bestowed upon one of the teachers of philosophy, probably lasted no longer than his own life. There was nothing equivalent to the privileges of graduation; and to have attended any of those schools was not necessary, in order to be permitted to practise any particular trade or profession. If the opinion of their own utility could not draw scholars to them, the law neither forced anybody to go to them, nor rewarded anybody for having gone to them. The teachers had no jurisdiction over their pupils, nor any other authority besides that natural authority which superior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people towards those who are entrusted with any part of their education.\n\nAt Rome, the study of the civil law made a part of the education, not of the greater part of the citizens, but of some particular families. The young people, however, who wished to acquire knowledge in the law, had no public school to go to, and had no other method of studying it, than by frequenting the company of such of their relations and friends as were supposed to understand it. It is, perhaps, worth while to remark, that though the laws of the twelve tables were many of them copied from those of some ancient Greek republics, yet law never seems to have grown up to be a science in any republic of ancient Greece. In Rome it became a science very early, and gave a considerable degree of illustration to those citizens who had the reputation of understanding it. In the republics of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, the ordinary courts of justice consisted of numerous, and therefore disorderly, bodies of people, who frequently decided almost at random, or as clamour, faction, and party-spirit, happened to determine. The ignominy of an unjust decision, when it was to be divided among five hundred, a thousand, or fifteen hundred people (for some of their courts were so very numerous), could not fall very heavy upon any individual. At Rome, on the contrary, the principal courts of justice consisted either of a single judge, or of a small number of judges, whose characters, especially as they deliberated always in public, could not fail to be very much affected by any rash or unjust decision. In doubtful cases such courts, from their anxiety to avoid blame, would naturally endeavour to shelter themselves under the example or precedent of the judges who had sat before them, either in the same or in some other court. This attention to practice and precedent, necessarily formed the Roman law into that regular and orderly system in which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention has had the like effects upon the laws of every other country where such attention has taken place. The superiority of character in the Romans over that of the Greeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, was probably more owing to the better constitution of their courts of justice, than to any of the circumstances to which those authors ascribe it. The Romans are said to have been particularly distinguished for their superior respect to an oath. But the people who were accustomed to make oath only before some diligent and well informed court of justice, would naturally be much more attentive to what they swore, than they who were accustomed to do the same thing before mobbish and disorderly assemblies.\n\nThe abilities, both civil and military, of the Greeks and Romans, will readily be allowed to have been at least equal to those of any modern nation. Our prejudice is perhaps rather to overrate them. But except in what related to military exercises, the state seems to have been at no pains to form those great abilities; for I cannot be induced to believe that the musical education of the Greeks could be of much consequence in forming them. Masters, however, had been found, it seems, for instructing the better sort of people among those nations, in every art and science in which the circumstances of their society rendered it necessary or convenient for them to be instructed. The demand for such instruction produced, what it always produces, the talent for giving it; and the emulation which an unrestrained competition never fails to excite, appears to have brought that talent to a very high degree of perfection. In the attention which the ancient philosophers excited, in the empire which they acquired over the opinions and principles of their auditors, in the faculty which they possessed of giving a certain tone and character to the conduct and conversation of those auditors, they appear to have been much superior to any modern teachers. In modern times, the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them more or less independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty, in competition with those who trade with a considerable one. If he sells his goods at nearly the same price, he cannot have the same profit; and poverty and beggary at least, if not bankruptcy and ruin, will infallibly be his lot. If he attempts to sell them much dearer, he is likely to have so few customers, that his circumstances will not be much mended. The privileges of graduation, besides, are in many countries necessary, or at least extremely convenient, to most men of learned professions, that is, to the far greater part of those who have occasion for a learned education. But those privileges can be obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers. The most careful attendance upon the ablest instructions of any private teacher cannot always give any title to demand them. It is from these different causes that the private teacher of any of the sciences, which are commonly taught in universities, is, in modern times, generally considered as in the very lowest order of men of letters. A man of real abilities can scarce find out a more humiliating or a more unprofitable employment to turn them to. The endowments of schools and colleges have in this manner not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones.\n\nWere there no public institutions for education, no system, no science, would be taught, for which there was not some demand, or which the circumstances of the times did not render it either necessary or convenient, or at least fashionable to learn. A private teacher could never find his account in teaching either an exploded and antiquated system of a science acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally believed to be a mere useless and pedantic heap of sophistry and nonsense. Such systems, such sciences, can subsist nowhere but in those incorporated societies for education, whose prosperity and revenue are in a great measure independent of their industry. Were there no public institutions for education, a gentleman, after going through, with application and abilities, the most complete course of education which the circumstances of the times were supposed to afford, could not come into the world completely ignorant of everything which is the common subject of conversation among gentlemen and men of the world.\n\nThere are no public institutions for the education of women, and there is accordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastical, in the common course of their education. They are taught what their parents or guardians judge it necessary or useful for them to learn, and they are taught nothing else. Every part of their education tends evidently to some useful purpose; either to improve the natural attractions of their person, or to form their mind to reserve, to modesty, to chastity, and to economy; to render them both likely to became the mistresses of a family, and to behave properly when they have become such. In every part of her life, a woman feels some conveniency or advantage from every part of her education. It seldom happens that a man, in any part of his life, derives any conveniency or advantage from some of the most laborious and troublesome parts of his education.\nOught the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the education of the people? Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people? and in what manner ought it to attend to them?\n\nIn some cases, the state of society necessarily places the greater part of individuals in such situations as naturally form in them, without any attention of government, almost all the abilities and virtues which that state requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other cases, the state of the society does not place the greater part of individuals in such situations; and some attention of government is necessary, in order to prevent the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.\n\nIn the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of the people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations; frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects, too, are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention, in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging; and unless very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard, with abhorrence, the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employment, than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilized society, this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.\nIt is otherwise in the barbarous societies, as they are commonly called, of hunters, of shepherds, and even of husbandmen in that rude state of husbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures, and the extension of foreign commerce. In such societies, the varied occupations of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity, and to invent expedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring. Invention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to fall into that drowsy stupidity, which, in a civilized society, seems to benumb the understanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people. In those barbarous societies, as they are called, every man, it has already been observed, is a warrior. Every man, too, is in some measure a statesman, and can form a tolerable judgment concerning the interest of the society, and the conduct of those who govern it. How far their chiefs are good judges in peace, or good leaders in war, is obvious to the observation of almost every single man among them. In such a society, indeed, no man can well acquire that improved and refined understanding which a few men sometimes possess in a more civilized state. Though in a rude society there is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every individual, there is not a great deal in those of the whole society. Every man does, or is capable of doing, almost every thing which any other man does, or is capable of being. Every man has a considerable degree of knowledge, ingenuity, and invention but scarce any man has a great degree. The degree, however, which is commonly possessed, is generally sufficient for conducting the whole simple business of the society. In a civilized state, on the contrary, though there is little variety in the occupations of the greater part of individuals, there is an almost infinite variety in those of the whole society. These varied occupations present an almost infinite variety of objects to the contemplation of those few, who, being attached to no particular occupation themselves, have leisure and inclination to examine the occupations of other people. The contemplation of so great a variety of objects necessarily exercises their minds in endless comparisons and combinations, and renders their understandings, in an extraordinary degree, both acute anti comprehensive. Unless those few, however, happen to be placed in some very particular situations, their great abilities, though honourable to themselves, may contribute very little to the good government or happiness of their society. Notwithstanding the great abilities of those few, all the nobler parts of the human character may be, in a great measure, obliterated and extinguished in the great body of the people.\n\nThe education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilized and commercial society, the attention of the public, more than that of people of some rank and fortune. People of some rank and fortune are generally eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular business, profession, or trade, by which they propose to distinguish themselves in the world. They have, before that, full time to acquire, or at least to fit themselves for afterwards acquiring, every accomplishment which can recommend them to the public esteem, or render them worthy of it. Their parents or guardians are generally sufficiently anxious that they should be so accomplished, and are in most cases, willing enough to lay out the expense which is necessary for that purpose. If they are not always properly educated, it is seldom from the want of expense laid out upon their education, but from the improper application of that expense. It is seldom from the want of masters, but from the negligence and incapacity of the masters who are to be had, and from the difficulty, or rather from the impossibility, which there is, in the present state of things, of finding any better. The employments, too, in which people of some rank or fortune spend the greater part of their lives, are not, like those of the common people, simple and uniform. They are almost all of them extremely complicated, and such as exercise the head more than the hands. The understandings of those who are engaged in such employments, can seldom grow torpid for want of exercise. The employments of people of some rank and fortune, besides, are seldom such as harass them from morning to night. They generally have a good deal of leisure, during which they may perfect themselves in every branch, either of useful or ornamental knowledge, of which they may have laid the foundation, or for which they may have acquired some taste in the earlier part of life.\n\nIt is otherwise with the common people. They have little time to spare for education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them, even in infancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must apply to some trade, by which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, is generally so simple and uniform, as to give little exercise to the understanding; while, at the same time, their labour is both so constant and so severe, that it leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to, or even to think of any thing else.\n\nBut though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well instructed as people of some rank and fortune; the most essential parts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at so early a period of life, that the greater part, even of those who are to be bred to the lowest occupations, have time to acquire them before they can be employed in those occupations. For a very small expense, the public can facilitate, can encourage and can even impose upon almost the whole body of the people, the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education.\n\nThe public can facilitate this acquisition, by establishing in every parish or district a little school, where children maybe taught for a reward so moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the master being partly, but not wholly, paid by the public; because, if he was wholly, or even principally, paid by it, he would soon learn to neglect his business. In Scotland, the establishment of such parish schools has taught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion of them to write and account. In England, the establishment of charity schools has had an effect of the same kind, though not so universally, because the establishment is not so universal. If, in those little schools, the books by which the children are taught to read, were a little more instructive than they commonly are; and if, instead of a little smattering in Latin, which the children of the common people are sometimes taught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics; the literary education of this rank of people would, perhaps, be as complete as can be. There is scarce a common trade, which does not afford some opportunities of applying to it the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which would not, therefore, gradually exercise and improve the common people in those principles, the necessary introduction to the most sublime, as well as to the most useful sciences.\n\nThe public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts of education, by giving small premiums, and little badges of distinction, to the children of the common people who excel in them.\n\nThe public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the necessity of acquiring the most essential parts of education, by obliging every man to undergo an examination or probation in them, before he can obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up any trade, either in a village or town corporate.\n\nIt was in this manner, by facilitating the acquisition of their military and gymnastic exercises, by encouraging it, and even by imposing upon the whole body of the people the necessity of learning those exercises, that the Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial spirit of their respective citizens. They facilitated the acquisition of those exercises, by appointing a certain place for learning and practising them, and by granting to certain masters the privilege of teaching in that place. Those masters do not appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges of any kind. Their reward consisted altogether in what they got from their scholars; and a citizen, who had learnt his exercises in the public gymnasia, had no sort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them privately, provided the latter had learned them equally well. Those republics encouraged the acquisition of those exercises, by bestowing little premiums and badges of distinction upon those who excelled in them. To have gained a prize in the Olympic, Isthmian, or Nemaean games, gave illustration, not only to the person who gained it, but to his whole family and kindred. The obligation which every citizen was under, to serve a certain number of years, if called upon, in the armies of the republic, sufficiently imposed the necessity of learning those exercises, without which he could not be fit for that service.\n\nThat in the progress of improvement, the practice of military exercises, unless government takes proper pains to support it, goes gradually to decay, and, together with it, the martial spirit of the great body of the people, the example of modern Europe sufficiently demonstrates. But the security of every society must always depend, more or less, upon the martial spirit of the great body of the people. In the present times, indeed, that martial spirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined standing army, would not, perhaps, be sufficient for the defence and security of any society. But where every citizen had the spirit of a soldier, a smaller standing army would surely be requisite. That spirit, besides, would necessarily diminish very much the dangers to liberty, whether real or imaginary, which are commonly apprehended from a standing army. As it would very much facilitate the operations of that army against a foreign invader; so it would obstruct them as much, if unfortunately they should ever be directed against the constitution of the state.\n\nThe ancient institutions of Greece and Rome seem to have been much more effectual for maintaining the martial spirit of the great body of the people, than the establishment of what are called the militias of modern times. They were much more simple. When they were once established, they executed themselves, and it required little or no attention from government to maintain them in the most perfect vigour. Whereas to maintain, even in tolerable execution, the complex regulations of any modern militia, requires the continual and painful attention of government, without which they are constantly falling into total neglect and disuse. The influence, besides, of the ancient institutions, was much more universal. By means of them, the whole body of the people was completely instructed in the use of arms; whereas it is but a very small part of them who can ever be so instructed by the regulations of any modern militia, except, perhaps, that of Switzerland. But a coward, a man incapable either of defending or of revenging himself, evidently wants one of the most essential parts of the character of a man. He is as much mutilated and deformed in his mind as another is in his body, who is either deprived of some of its most essential members, or has lost the use of them. He is evidently the more wretched and miserable of the two; because happiness and misery, which reside altogether in the mind, must necessarily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful, the mutilated or entire state of the mind, than upon that of the body. Even though the martial spirit of the people were of no use towards the defence of the society, yet, to prevent that sort of mental mutilation, deformity, and wretchedness, which cowardice necessarily involves in it, from spreading themselves through the great body of the people, would still deserve the most serious attention of government; in the same manner as it would deserve its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy, or any other loathsome and offensive disease, though neither mortal nor dangerous, from spreading itself among them; though, perhaps, no other public good might result from such attention, besides the prevention of so great a public evil.\n\nThe same thing may be said of the gross ignorance and stupidity which, in a civilized society, seem so frequently to benumb the understandings of all the inferior ranks of people. A man without the proper use of the intellectual faculties of a man, is, if possible, more contemptible than even a coward, and seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more essential part of the character of human nature. Though the state was to derive no advantage from the instruction of the inferior ranks of people, it would still deserve its attention that they should not be altogether uninstructed. The state, however, derives no inconsiderable advantage from their instruction. The more they are instructed, the less liable they are to the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition, which, among ignorant nations frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders. An instructed and intelligent people, besides, are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and stupid one. They feel themselves, each individually, more respectable, and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful superiors, and they are, therefore, more disposed to respect those superiors. They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing through, the interested complaints of faction and sedition; and they are, upon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of government. In free countries, where the safety of government depends very much upon the favourable judgment which the people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of the highest importance, that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or capriciously concerning it.\n\nArt. III.\u2014Of the Expense of the Institutions for the Instruction of People of all Ages.\n\nThe institutions for the instruction of people of all ages, are chiefly those for religious instruction. This is a species of instruction, of which the object is not so much to render the people good citizens in this world, as to prepare them for another and a better world in the life to come. The teachers of the doctrine which contains this instruction, in the same manner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their subsistence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers; or they may derive it from some other fund, to which the law of their country may entitle them; such as a landed estate, a tythe or land tax, an established salary or stipend. Their exertion, their zeal and industry, are likely to be much greater in the former situation than in the latter. In this respect, the teachers of a new religion have always had a considerable advantage in attacking those ancient and established systems, of which the clergy, reposing themselves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up the fervour of faith and devotion in the great body of the people; and having given themselves up to indolence, were become altogether incapable of making any vigorous exertion in defence even of their own establishment. The clergy of an established and well endowed religion frequently become men of learning and elegance, who possess all the virtues of gentlemen, or which can recommend them to the esteem of gentlemen; but they are apt gradually to lose the qualities, both good and bad, which gave them authority and influence with the inferior ranks of people, and which had perhaps been the original causes of the success and establishment of their religion. Such a clergy, when attacked by a set of popular and bold, though perhaps stupid and ignorant enthusiasts, feel themselves as perfectly defenceless as the indolent, effeminate, and full fed nations of the southern parts of Asia, when they were invaded by the active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the north. Such a clergy, upon such an emergency, have commonly no other resource than to call upon the civil magistrate to persecute, destroy, or drive out their adversaries, as disturbers of the public peace. It was thus that the Roman catholic clergy called upon the civil magistrate to persecute the protestants, and the church of England to persecute the dissenters; and that in general every religious sect, when it has once enjoyed, for a century or two, the security of a legal establishment, has found itself incapable of making any vigorous defence against any new sect which chose to attack its doctrine or discipline. Upon such occasions, the advantage, in point of learning and good writing, may sometimes be on the side of the established church. But the arts of popularity, all the arts of gaining proselytes, are constantly on the side of its adversaries. In England, those arts have been long neglected by the well endowed clergy of the established church, and are at present chiefly cultivated by the dissenters and by the methodists. The independent provisions, however, which in many places have been made for dissenting teachers, by means of voluntary subscriptions, of trust rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to have abated the zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of them become very learned, ingenious, and respectable men; but they have in general ceased to be very popular preachers. The methodists, without half the learning of the dissenters, are much more in vogue.\n\nIn the church of Rome the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy are kept more alive by the powerful motive of self-interest, than perhaps in any established protestant church. The parochial clergy derive many of them, a very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary oblations of the people; a source of revenue, which confession gives them many opportunities of improving. The mendicant orders derive their whole subsistence from such oblations. It is with them as with the hussars and light infantry of some armies; no plunder, no pay. The parochial clergy are like those teachers whose reward depends partly upon their salary, and partly upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils; and these must always depend, more or less, upon their industry and reputation. The mendicant orders are like those teachers whose subsistence depends altogether upon their industry. They are obliged, therefore, to use every art which can animate the devotion of the common people. The establishment of the two great mendicant orders of St Dominic and St. Francis, it is observed by Machiavel, revived, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the languishing faith and devotion of the catholic church. In Roman catholic countries, the spirit of devotion is supported altogether by the monks, and by the poorer parochial clergy. The great dignitaries of the church, with all the accomplishments of gentlemen and men of the world, and sometimes with those of men of learning, are careful to maintain the necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give themselves any trouble about the instruction of the people.\n\n\"Most of the arts and professions in a state,\" says by far the most illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age, \"are of such a nature, that, while they promote the interests of the society, they are also useful or agreeable to some individuals; and, in that case, the constant rule of the magistrate, except, perhaps, on the first introduction of any art, is, to leave the profession to itself, and trust its encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it. The artizans, finding their profits to rise by the favour of their customers, increase, as much as possible, their skill and industry; and as matters are not disturbed by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is always sure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand.\n\n\"But there are also some callings which, though useful and even necessary in a state, bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual; and the supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers of those professions. It must give them public encouragement in order to their subsistence; and it must provide against that negligence to which they will naturally be subject, either by annexing particular honours to profession, by establishing a long subordination of ranks, and a strict dependence, or by some other expedient. The persons employed in the finances, fleets, and magistracy, are instances of this order of men.\n\n\"It may naturally be thought, at first sight, that the ecclesiastics belong to the first class, and that their encouragement, as well as that of lawyers and physicians, may safely be entrusted to the liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or consolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance. Their industry and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by such an additional motive; and their skill in the profession, as well as their address in governing the minds of the people, must receive daily increase, from their increasing practice, study, and attention.\n\n\"But if we consider the matter more closely, we shall find that this interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will study to prevent; because, in every religion except the true, it is highly pernicious, and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the truth, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner, in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers, will inspire them with the most violent abhorrence of all other sects, and continually endeavour, by some novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience. No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency, in the doctrines inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted that best suits the disorderly affections of the human frame. Customers will be drawn to each conventicle by new industry and address, in practising on the passions and credulity of the populace. And, in the end, the civil magistrate will find that he has dearly paid for his intended frugality, in saving a fixed establishment for the priests; and that, in reality, the most decent and advantageous composition, which he can make with the spiritual guides, is to bribe their indolence, by assigning stated salaries to their profession, and rendering it superfluous for them to be farther active, than merely to prevent their flock from straying in quest of new pastors. And in this manner ecclesiastical establishments, though commonly they arose at first from religious views, prove in the end advantageous to the political interests of society.\"\n\nBut whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent provision of the clergy, it has, perhaps, been very seldom bestowed upon them from any view to those effects. Times of violent religious controversy have generally been times of equally violent political faction. Upon such occasions, each political party has either found it, or imagined it, for his interest, to league itself with some one or other of the contending religious sects. But this could be done only by adopting, or, at least, by favouring the tenets of that particular sect. The sect which had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering party necessarily shared in the victory of its ally, by whose favour and protection it was soon enabled, in some degree, to silence and subdue all its adversaries. Those adversaries had generally leagued themselves with the enemies of the conquering party, and were, therefore the enemies of that party. The clergy of this particular sect having thus become complete masters of the field, and their influence and authority with the great body of the people being in its highest vigour, they were powerful enough to overawe the chiefs and leaders of their own party, and to oblige the civil magistrate to respect their opinions and inclinations. Their first demand was generally that he should silence and subdue all their adversaries; and their second, that he should bestow an independent provision on themselves. As they had generally contributed a good deal to the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should have some share in the spoil. They were weary, besides, of humouring the people, and of depending upon their caprice for a subsistence. In making this demand, therefore, they consulted their own ease and comfort, without troubling themselves about the effect which it might have, in future times, upon the influence and authority of their order. The civil magistrate, who could comply with their demand only by giving them something which he would have chosen much rather to take, or to keep to himself, was seldom very forward to grant it. Necessity, however, always forced him to submit at last, though frequently not till after many delays, evasions, and affected excuses.\n\nBut if politics had never called in the aid of religion, had the conquering party never adopted the tenets of one sect more than those of another, when it had gained the victory, it would probably have dealt equally and impartially with all the different sects, and have allowed every man to choose his own priest, and his own religion, as he thought proper. There would, and, in this case, no doubt, have been, a great multitude of religious sects. Almost every different congregation might probably have had a little sect by itself, or have entertained some peculiar tenets of its own. Each teacher, would, no doubt, have felt himself under the necessity of making the utmost exertion, and of using every art, both to preserve and to increase the number of his disciples. But as every other teacher would have felt himself under the same necessity, the success of no one teacher, or sect of teachers, could have been very great. The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects, whose tenets, being supported by the civil magistrate, are held in veneration by almost all the inhabitants of extensive kingdoms and empires, and who, therefore, see nothing round them but followers, disciples, and humble admirers. The teachers of each little sect, finding themselves almost alone, would be obliged to respect those of almost every other sect; and the concessions which they would mutually find in both convenient and agreeable to make one to another, might in time, probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism, such as wise men have, in all ages of the world, wished to see established; but such as positive law has, perhaps, never yet established, and probably never will establish in any country; because, with regard to religion, positive law always has been, and probably always will be, more or less influenced by popular superstition and enthusiasm. This plan of ecclesiastical government, or, more properly, of no ecclesiastical government, was what the sect called Independents (a sect, no doubt, of very wild enthusiasts), proposed to establish in England towards the end of the civil war. If it had been established, though of a very unphilosophical origin, it would probably, by this time, have been productive of the most philosophical good temper and moderation with regard to every sort of religious principle. It has been established in Pennsylvania, where, though the quakers happen to be the most numerous, the law, in reality, favours no one sect more than another; and it is there said to have been productive of this philosophical good temper and moderation.\n\nBut though this equality of treatment should not be productive of this good temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of the religious sects of a particular country; yet, provided those sects were sufficiently numerous, and each of them consequently too small to disturb the public tranquillity, the excessive zeal of each for its particular tenets could not well be productive of any very hurtful effects, but, on the contrary, of several good ones; and if the government was perfectly decided, both to let them all alone, and to oblige them all to let alone one another, there is little danger that they would not of their own accord, subdivide themselves fast enough, so as soon to become sufficiently numerous.\n\nIn every civilized society, in every society where the distinction of ranks has once been completely established, there have been always two different schemes or systems of morality current at the same time; of which the one may be called the strict or austere; the other the liberal, or, if you will, the loose system. The former is generally admired and revered by the common people; the latter is commonly more esteemed and adopted by what are called the people of fashion. The degree of disapprobation with which we ought to mark the vices of levity, the vices which are apt to arise from great prosperity, and from the excess of gaiety and good humour, seems to constitute the principal distinction between those two opposite schemes or systems. In the liberal or loose system, luxury, wanton, and even disorderly mirth, the pursuit of pleasure to some degree of intemperance, the breach of chastity, at least in one of the two sexes, etc. provided they are not accompanied with gross indecency, and do not lead to falsehood and injustice, are generally treated with a good deal of indulgence, and are easily either excused or pardoned altogether. In the austere system, on the contrary, those excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation. The vices of levity are always ruinous to the common people, and a single week's thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever, and to drive him, through despair, upon committing the most enormous crimes. The wiser and better sort of the common people, therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such excesses, which their experience tells them are so immediately fatal to people of their condition. The disorder and extravagance of several years, on the contrary, will not always ruin a man of fashion; and people of that rank are very apt to consider the power of indulging in some degree of excess, as one of the advantages of their fortune; and the liberty of doing so without censure or reproach, as one of the privileges which belong to their station. In people of their own station, therefore, they regard such excesses with but a small degree of disapprobation, and censure them either very slightly or not at all.\n\nAlmost all religious sects have begun among the common people, from whom they have generally drawn their earliest, as well as their most numerous proselytes. The austere system of morality has, accordingly, been adopted by those sects almost constantly, or with very few exceptions; for there have been some. It was the system by which they could best recommend themselves to that order of people, to whom they first proposed their plan of reformation upon what had been before established. Many of them, perhaps the greater part of them, have even endeavoured to gain credit by refining upon this austere system, and by carrying it to some degree of folly and extravagance; and this excessive rigour has frequently recommended them, more than any thing else, to the respect and veneration of the common people.\n\nA man of rank and fortune is, by his station, the distinguished member of a great society, who attend to every part of his conduct, and who thereby oblige him to attend to every part of it himself. His authority and consideration depend very much upon the respect which this society bears to him. He dares not do anything which would disgrace or discredit him in it; and he is obliged to a very strict observation of that species of morals, whether liberal or austere, which the general consent of this society prescribes to persons of his rank and fortune. A man of low condition, on the contrary, is far from being a distinguished member of any great society. While he remains in a country village, his conduct may be attended to, and he may be obliged to attend to it himself. In this situation, and in this situation only, he may have what is called a character to lose. But as soon as he comes into a great city, he is sunk in obscurity and darkness. His conduct is observed and attended to by nobody; and he is, therefore, very likely to neglect it himself, and to abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy and vice. He never emerges so effectually from this obscurity, his conduct never excites so much the attention of any respectable society, as by his becoming the member of a small religious sect. He from that moment acquires a degree of consideration which he never had before. All his brother sectaries are, for the credit of the sect, interested to observe his conduct; and, if he gives occasion to any scandal, if he deviates very much from those austere morals which they almost always require of one another, to punish him by what is always a very severe punishment, even where no evil effects attend it, expulsion or excommunication from the sect. In little religious sects, accordingly, the morals of the common people have been almost always remarkably regular and orderly; generally much more so than in the established church. The morals of those little sects, indeed, have frequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and unsocial.\n\nThere are two very easy and effectual remedies, however, by whose joint operation the state might, without violence, correct whatever was unsocial or disagreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little sects into which the country was divided.\nThe first of those remedies is the study of science and philosophy, which the state might render almost universal among all people of middling or more than middling rank and fortune; not by giving salaries to teachers in order to make them negligent and idle, but by instituting some sort of probation, even in the higher and more difficult sciences, to be undergone by every person before he was permitted to exercise any liberal profession, or before he could be received as a candidate for any honourable office, of trust or profit. If the state imposed upon this order of men the necessity of learning, it would have no occasion to give itself any trouble about providing them with proper teachers. They would soon find better teachers for themselves, than any whom the state could provide for them. Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition; and where all the superior ranks of people were secured from it, the inferior ranks could not be much exposed to it.\n\nThe second of those remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public diversions. The state, by encouraging, that is, by giving entire liberty to all those who, from their own interest, would attempt, without scandal or indecency, to amuse and divert the people by painting, poetry, music, dancing; by all sorts of dramatic representations and exhibitions; would easily dissipate, in the greater part of them, that melancholy and gloomy humour which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition and enthusiasm. Public diversions have always been the objects of dread and hatred to all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies. The gaiety and good humour which those diversions inspire, were altogether inconsistent with that temper of mind which was fittest for their purpose, or which they could best work upon. Dramatic representations, besides, frequently exposing their artifices to public ridicule, and sometimes even to public execration, were, upon that account, more than all other diversions, the objects of their peculiar abhorrence.\n\nIn a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion more than those of another, it would not be necessary that any of them should have any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign or executive power; or that he should have anything to do either in appointing or in dismissing them from their offices. In such a situation, he would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them, further than to keep the peace among them, in the same manner as among the rest of his subjects, that is, to hinder them from persecuting, abusing, or oppressing one another. But it is quite otherwise in countries where there is an established or governing religion. The sovereign can in this case never be secure, unless he has the means of influencing in a considerable degree the greater part of the teachers of that religion.\n\nThe clergy of every established church constitute a great incorporation. They can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan, and with one spirit as much as if they were under the direction of one man; and they are frequently, too, under such direction. Their interest as an incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is sometimes directly opposite to it. Their great interest is to maintain their authority with the people, and this authority depends upon the supposed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they inculcate, and upon the supposed necessity of adopting every part of it with the most implicit faith, in order to avoid eternal misery. Should the sovereign have the imprudence to appear either to deride, or doubt himself of the most trifling part of their doctrine, or from humanity, attempt to protect those who did either the one or the other, the punctilious honour of a clergy, who have no sort of dependency upon him, is immediately provoked to proscribe him as a profane person, and to employ all the terrors of religion, in order to oblige the people to transfer their allegiance to some more orthodox and obedient prince. Should he oppose any of their pretensions or usurpations, the danger is equally great. The princes who have dared in this manner to rebel against the church, over and above this crime of rebellion, have generally been charged, too, with the additional crime of heresy, notwithstanding their solemn protestations of their faith, and humble submission to every tenet which she thought proper to prescribe to them. But the authority of religion is superior to every other authority. The fears which it suggests conquer all other fears. When the authorized teachers of religion propagate through the great body of the people, doctrines subversive of the authority of the sovereign, it is by violence only, or by the force of a standing army, that he can maintain his authority. Even a standing army cannot in this case give him any lasting security; because if the soldiers are not foreigners, which can seldom be the case, but drawn from the great body of the people, which must almost always be the case, they are likely to be soon corrupted by those very doctrines. The revolutions which the turbulence of the Greek clergy was continually occasioning at Constantinople, as long as the eastern empire subsisted; the convulsions which, during the course of several centuries, the turbulence of the Roman clergy was continually occasioning in every part of Europe, sufficiently demonstrate how precarious and insecure must always be the situation of the sovereign, who has no proper means of influencing the clergy of the established and governing religion of his country.\n\nArticles of faith, as well as all other spiritual matters, it is evident enough, are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign, who, though he may be very well qualified for protecting, is seldom supposed to be so for instructing the people. With regard to such matters, therefore, his authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the united authority of the clergy of the established church. The public tranquillity, however, and his own security, may frequently depend upon the doctrines which they may think proper to propagate concerning such matters. As he can seldom directly oppose their decision, therefore, with proper weight and authority, it is necessary that he should be able to influence it; and he can influence it only by the fears and expectations which he may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order. Those fears and expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or other punishment, and in the expectation of further preferment.\nIn all Christian churches, the benefices of the clergy are a sort of freeholds, which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life or good behaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable to be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign or of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain their authority with the people, who would then consider them as mercenary dependents upon the court, in the sincerity of whose instructions they could no longer have any confidence. But should the sovereign attempt irregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of clergymen of their freeholds, on account, perhaps, of their having propagated, with more than ordinary zeal, some factious or seditious doctrine, he would only render, by such persecution, both them and their doctrine ten times more popular, and therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous, than they had been before. Fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of govermnent, and ought in particular never to be employed against any order of men who have the smallest pretensions to independency. To attempt to terrify them, serves only to irritate their bad humour, and to confirm them in an opposition, which more gentle usage, perhaps, might easily induce them either to soften, or to lay aside altogether. The violence which the French government usually employed in order to oblige all their parliaments, or sovereign courts of justice, to enregister any unpopular edict, very seldom succeeded. The means commonly employed, however, the imprisonment of all the refractory members, one would think, were forcible enough. The princes of the house of Stuart sometimes employed the like means in order to influence some of the members of the parliament of England, and they generally found them equally intractable. The parliament of England is now managed in another manner; and a very small experiment, which the duke of Choiseul made, about twelve years ago, upon the parliament of Paris, demonstrated sufficiently that all the parliaments of France might have been managed still more easily in the same manner. That experiment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are always the easiest and safest instruments of government as force and violence are the worst and the most dangerous; yet such, it seems, is the natural insolence of man, that he almost always disdains to use the good instrument, except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one. The French government could and durst use force, and therefore disdained to use management and persuasion. But there is no order of men, it appears I believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so dangerous or rather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the respected clergy of an established church. The rights, the privileges, the personal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic, who is upon good terms with his own order, are, even in the most despotic governments, more respected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune. It is so in every gradation of despotism, from that of the gentle and mild government of Paris, to that of the violent and furious government of Constantinople. But though this order of men can scarce ever be forced, they may be managed as easily as any other; and the security of the sovereign, as well as the public tranquillity, seems to depend very much upon the means which he has of managing them; and those means seem to consist altogether in the preferment which he has to bestow upon them.\n\nIn the ancient constitution of the Christian church, the bishop of each diocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of the episcopal city. The people did not long retain their right of election; and while they did retain it, they almost always acted under the influence of the clergy, who, in such spiritual matters, appeared to be their natural guides. The clergy, however, soon grew weary of the trouble of managing them, and found it easier to elect their own bishops themselves. The abbot, in the same manner, was elected by the monks of the monastery, at least in the greater part of abbacies. All the inferior ecclesiastical benefices comprehended within the diocese were collated by the bishop, who bestowed them upon such ecclesiastics as he thought proper. All church preferments were in this manner in the disposal of the church. The sovereign, though he might have some indirect influence in those elections, and though it was sometimes usual to ask both his consent to elect, and his approbation of the election, yet had no direct or sufficient means of managing the clergy. The ambition of every clergyman naturally led him to pay court, not so much to his sovereign as to his own order, from which only he could expect preferment.\nThrough the greater part of Europe, the pope gradually drew to himself, first the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies, or of what were called consistorial benefices, and afterwards, by various machinations and pretences, of the greater part of inferior benefices comprehended within each diocese, little more being left to the bishop than what was barely necessary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy. By this arrangement the condition of the sovereign was still worse than it had been before. The clergy of all the different countries of Europe were thus formed into a sort of spiritual army, dispersed in different quarters indeed, but of which all the movements and operations could now be directed by one head, and conducted upon one uniform plan. The clergy of each particular country might be considered as a particular detachment of that army, of which the operations could easily be supported and seconded by all the other detachments quartered in the different countries round about. Each detachment was not only independent of the sovereign of the country in which it was quartered, and by which it was maintained, but dependent upon a foreign sovereign, who could at any time turn its arms against the sovereign of that particular country, and support them by the arms of all the other detachments.\n\nThose arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined. In the ancient state of Europe, before the establishment of arts and manufactures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of influence over the common people which that of the great barons gave them over their respective vassals, tenants, and retainers. In the great landed estates, which the mistaken piety both of princes and private persons had bestowed upon the church, jurisdictions were established, of the same kind with those of the great barons, and for the same reason. In those great landed estates, the clergy, or their bailiffs, could easily keep the peace, without the support or assistance either of the king or of any other person; and neither the king nor any other person could keep the peace there without the support and assistance of the clergy. The jurisdictions of the clergy, therefore, in their particular baronies or manors, were equally independent, and equally exclusive of the authority of the king's courts, as those of the great temporal lords. The tenants of the clergy were, like those of the great barons, almost all tenants at will, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and, therefore, liable to be called out at pleasure, in order to fight in any quarrel in which the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above the rents of those estates, the clergy possessed in the tithes a very large portion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe. The revenues arising from both those species of rents were, the greater part of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle, poultry, etc. The quantity exceeded greatly what the clergy could themselves consume; and there were neither arts nor manufactures, for the produce of which they could exchange the surplus. The clergy could derive advantage from this immense surplus in no other way than by employing it, as the great barons employed the like surplus of their revenues, in the most profuse hospitality, and in the most extensive charity. Both the hospitality and the charity of the ancient clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very great. They not only maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom, but many knights and gentlemen had frequently no other means of subsistence than by travelling about from monastery to monastery, under pretence of devotion, but in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the clergy. The retainers of some particular prelates were often as numerous as those of the greatest lay-lords; and the retainers of all the clergy taken together were, perhaps, more numerous than those of all the lay-lords. There was always much more union among the clergy than among the lay-lords. The former were under a regular discipline and subordination to the papal authority. The latter were under no regular discipline or subordination, but almost always equally jealous of one another, and of the king. Though the tenants and retainers of the clergy, therefore, had both together been less numerous than those of the great lay-lords, and their tenants were probably much less numerous, yet their union would have rendered them more formidable. The hospitality and charity of the clergy, too, not only gave them the command of a great temporal force, but increased very much the weight of their spiritual weapons. Those virtues procured them the highest respect and veneration among all the inferior ranks of people, of whom many were constantly, and almost all occasionally, fed by them. Everything belonging or related to so popular an order, its possessions, its privileges, its doctrines, necessarily appeared sacred in the eyes of the common people; and every violation of them, whether real or pretended, the highest act of sacrilegious wickedness and profaneness. In this state of things, if the sovereign frequently found it difficult to resist the confederacy of a few of the great nobility, we cannot wonder that he should find it still more so to resist the united force of the clergy of his own dominions, supported by that of the clergy of all the neighbouring dominions. In such circumstances, the wonder is, not that he was sometimes obliged to yield, but that he ever was able to resist.\n\nThe privileges of the clergy in those ancient times (which to us, who live in the present times, appear the most absurd), their total exemption from the secular jurisdiction, for example, or what in England was called the benefit of clergy, were the natural, or rather the necessary, consequences of this state of things. How dangerous must it have been for the sovereign to attempt to punish a clergyman for any crime whatever, if his order were disposed to protect him, and to represent either the proof as insufficient for convicting so holy a man, or the punishment as too severe to be inflicted upon one whose person had been rendered sacred by religion? The sovereign could, in such circumstances, do no better than leave him to be tried by the ecclesiastical courts, who, for the honour of their own order, were interested to restrain, as much as possible, every member of it from committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occasion to such gross scandal as might disgust the minds of the people.\nIn the state in which things were, through the greater part of Europe, during the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, and for some time both before and after that period, the constitution of the church of Rome may be considered as the most formidable combination that ever was formed against the authority and security of civil government, as well as against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind, which can flourish only where civil government is able to protect them. In that constitution, the grossest delusions of superstition were supported in such a manner by the private interests of so great a number of people, as put them out of all danger from any assault of human reason; because, though human reason might, perhaps, have been able to unveil, even to the eyes of the common people, some of the delusions of superstition, it could never have dissolved the ties of private interest. Had this constitution been attacked by no other enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason, it must have endured for ever. But that immense and well-built fabric, which all the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken, much less have overturned, was, by the natural course of things, first weakened, and afterwards in part destroyed; and is now likely, in the course of a few centuries more, perhaps, to crumble into ruins altogether.\n\nThe gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce, the same causes which destroyed the power of the great barons, destroyed, in the same manner, through the greater part of Europe, the whole temporal manufactures, and commerce, the clergy, like the great barons, found something for which they could exchange their rude produce, and thereby discovered the means of spending their whole revenues upon their own persons, without giving any considerable share of them to other people. Their charity became gradually less extensive, their hospitality less liberal, or less profuse. Their retainers became consequently less numerous, and, by degrees, dwindled away altogether. The clergy, too, like the great barons, wished to get a better rent from their landed estates, in order to spend it, in the same manner, upon the gratification of their own private vanity and folly. But this increase of rent could be got only by granting leases to their tenants, who thereby became, in a great measure, independent of them. The ties of interest, which bound the inferior ranks of people to the clergy, were in this manner gradually broken and dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner than those which bound the same ranks of people to the great barons; because the benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much smaller than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each benefice was much sooner able to spend the whole of its revenue upon his own person. During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in full vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command which they had once had over the great body of the people was very much decayed. The power of the church was, by that time, very nearly reduced, through the greater part of Europe, to what arose from their spiritual authority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened, when it ceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The inferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order as they had done before; as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of their indigence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by the vanity, luxury, and expense of the richer clergy, who appeared to spend upon their own pleasures what had always before been regarded as the patrimony of the poor.\n\nIn this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of Europe endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had in the disposal of the great benefices of the church; by procuring to the deans and chapters of each diocese the restoration of their ancient right of electing the bishop; and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the abbot. The re-establishing this ancient order was the object of several statutes enacted in England during the course of the fourteenth century, particularly of what is called the statute of provisors; and of the pragmatic sanction, established in France in the fifteenth century. In order to render the election valid, it was necessary that the sovereign should both consent to it before hand, and afterwards approve of the person elected; and though the election was still supposed to be free, he had, however all the indirect means which his situation necessarily afforded him, of influencing the clergy in his own dominions. Other regulations, of a similar tendency, were established in other parts of Europe. But the power of the pope, in the collation of the great benefices of the church, seems, before the reformation, to have been nowhere so effectually and so universally restrained as in France and England. The concordat afterwards, in the sixteenth century, gave to the kings of France the absolute right of presenting to all the great, or what are called the consistorial, benefices of the Gallican church.\nSince the establishment of the pragmatic sanction and of the concordat, the clergy of France have in general shewn less respect to the decrees of the papal court, than the clergy of any other catholic country. In all the disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have almost constantly taken part with the former. This independency of the clergy of France upon the court of Rome seems to be principally founded upon the pragmatic sanction and the concordat. In the earlier periods of the monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted to the pope as those of any other country. When Robert, the second prince of the Capetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of Rome, his own servants, it is said, threw the victuals which came from his table to the dogs, and refused to taste any thing themselves which had been polluted by the contact of a person in his situation. They were taught to do so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own dominions.\n\nThe claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in defence of which the court of Rome had frequently shaken, and sometimes overturned, the thrones of some of the greatest sovereigns in Christendom, was in this manner either restrained or modified, or given up altogether, in many different parts of Europe, even before the time of the reformation. As the clergy had now less influence over the people, so the state had more influence over the clergy. The clergy, therefore, had both less power, and less inclination, to disturb the state.\n\nThe authority of the church of Rome was in this state of declension, when the disputes which gave birth to the reformation began in Germany, and soon spread themselves through every part of Europe. The new doctrines were everywhere received with a high degree of popular favour. They were propagated with all that enthusiastic zeal which commonly animates the spirit of party, when it attacks established authority. The teachers of those doctrines, though perhaps, in other respects, not more learned than many of the divines who defended the established church, seem in general to have been better acquainted with ecclesiastical history, and with the origin and progress of that system of opinions upon which the authority of the church was established; and they had thereby the advantage in almost every dispute. The austerity of their manners gave them authority with the common people, who contrasted the strict regularity of their conduct with the disorderly lives of the greater part of their own clergy. They possessed, too, in a much higher degree than their adversaries, all the arts of popularity and of gaining proselytes; arts which the lofty and dignified sons of the church had long neglected, as being to them in a great measure useless. The reason of the new doctrines recommended them to some, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the established clergy to a still greater number: but the zealous, passionate, and fanatical, though frequently coarse and rustic eloquence, with which they were almost everywhere inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest number.\n\nThe success of the new doctrines was almost everywhere so great, that the princes, who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of Rome, were, by means of them, easily enabled, in their own dominions, to overturn the church, which having lost the respect and veneration of the inferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The court of Rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts of Germany, whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be worth the managing. They universally, therefore, established the reformation in their own dominions. The tyranny of Christiern II., and of Troll archbishop of Upsal, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from Sweden. The pope favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus Vasa found no difficulty in establishing the reformation in Sweden. Christiern II. was afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his conduct had rendered him as odious as in Sweden. The pope, however, was still disposed to favour him; and Frederic of Holstein, who had mounted the throne in his stead, revenged himself, by following the example of Gustavus Vasa. The magistrates of Berne and Zurich, who had no particular quarrel with the pope, established with great ease the reformation in their respective cantons, where just before some of the clergy had, by an imposture somewhat grosser than ordinary, rendered the whole order both odious and contemptible.\n\nIn this critical situation of its affairs the papal court was at sufficient pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of France and Spain, of whom the latter was at that time emperor of Germany. With their assistance, it was enabled, though not without great difficulty, and much bloodshed, either to suppress altogether, or to obstruct very much, the progress of the reformation in their dominions. It was well enough inclined, too, to be complaisant to the king of England. But from the circumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving offence to a still greater sovereign, Charles V., king of Spain and emperor of Germany. Henry VIII., accordingly, though he did not embrace himself the greater part of the doctrines of the reformation, was yet enabled, by their general prevalence, to suppress all the monasteries, and to abolish the authority of the church of Rome in his dominions. That he should go so far, though he went no further, gave some satisfaction to the patrons of the reformation, who, having got possession of the government in the reign of his son and successor completed, without any difficulty, the work which Henry VIII. had begun.\n\nIn some countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak, unpopular, and not very firmly established, the reformation was strong enough to overturn, not only the church, but the state likewise, for attempting to support the church.\nAmong the followers of the reformation, dispersed in all the different countries of Europe, there was no general tribunal, which, like that of the court of Rome, or an oecumenical council, could settle all disputes among them, and, with irresistible authority, prescribe to all of them the precise limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the reformation in one country, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as they had no common judge to appeal to, the dispute could never be decided; and many such disputes arose among them. Those concerning the government of the church, and the right of conferring ecclesiastical benefices, were perhaps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society. They gave birth, accordingly, to the two principal parties or sects among the followers of the reformation, the Lutheran and Calvinistic sects, the only sects among them, of which the doctrine and discipline have ever yet been established by law in any part of Europe.\nThe followers of Luther, together with what is called the church of England, preserved more or less of the episcopal government, established subordination among the clergy, gave the sovereign the disposal of all the bishoprics, and other consistorial benefices within his dominions, and thereby rendered him the real head of the church; and without depriving the bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices within his diocese, they, even to those benefices, not only admitted, but favoured the right of presentation, both in the sovereign and in all other lay patrons. This system of church government was, from the beginning, favourable to peace and good order, and to submission to the civil sovereign. It has never, accordingly, been the occasion of any tumult or civil commotion in any country in which it has once been established. The church of England, in particular, has always valued herself, with great reason, upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her principles. Under such a government, the clergy naturally endeavour to recommend themselves to the sovereign, to the court, and to the nobility and gentry of the country, by whose influence they chiefly expect to obtain preferment. They pay court to those patrons, sometimes, no doubt, by the vilest flattery and assentation; but frequently, too, by cultivating all those arts which best deserve, and which are therefore most likely to gain them, the esteem of people of rank and fortune; by their knowledge in all the different branches of useful and ornamental learning, by the decent liberality of their manners, by the social good humour of their conversation, and by their avowed contempt of those absurd and hypocritical austerities which fanatics inculcate and pretend to practise, in order to draw upon themselves the veneration, and upon the greater part of men of rank and fortune, who avow that they do not practise them, the abhorrence of the common people. Such a clergy, however, while they pay their court in this manner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect altogether the means of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower. They are listened to, esteemed, and respected by their superiors; but before their inferiors they are frequently incapable of defending, effectually, and to the conviction of such hearers, their own sober and moderate doctrines, against the most ignorant enthusiast who chooses to attack them.\n\nThe followers of Zuinglius, or more properly those of Calvin, on the contrary, bestowed upon the people of each parish, whenever the church became vacant, the right of electing their own pastor; and established, at the same time, the most perfect equality among the clergy. The former part of this institution, as long as it remained in vigour, seems to have been productive of nothing but disorder and confusion, and to have tended equally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people. The latter part seems never to have had any effects but what were perfectly agreeable.\n\nAs long as the people of each parish preserved the right of electing their own pastors, they acted almost always under the influence of the clergy, and generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order. The clergy, in order to preserve their influence in those popular elections, became, or affected to become, many of them, fanatics themselves, encouraged fanaticism among the people, and gave the preference almost always to the most fanatical candidate. So small a matter as the appointment of a parish priest, occasioned almost always a violent contest, not only in one parish, but in all the neighbouring parishes who seldom failed to take part in the quarrel. When the parish happened to be situated in a great city, it divided all the inhabitants into two parties; and when that city happened, either to constitute itself a little republic, or to be the head and capital of a little republic, as in the case with many of the considerable cities in Switzerland and Holland, every paltry dispute of this kind, over and above exasperating the animosity of all their other factions, threatened to leave behind it, both a new schism in the church, and a new faction in the state. In those small republics, therefore, the magistrate very soon found it necessary, for the sake of preserving the public peace, to assume to himself the right of presenting to all vacant benefices. In Scotland, the most extensive country in which this presbyterian form of church government has ever been established, the rights of patronage were in effect abolished by the act which established presbytery in the beginning of the reign of William III. That act, at least, put in the power of certain classes of people in each parish to purchase, for a very small price, the right of electing their own pastor. The constitution which this act established, was allowed to subsist for about two-and-twenty years, but was abolished by the 10th of queen Anne, ch.12, on account of the confusions and disorders which this more popular mode of election had almost everywhere occasioned. In so extensive a country as Scotland, however, a tumult in a remote parish was not so likely to give disturbance to government as in a smaller state. The 10th of queen Anne restored the rights of patronage. But though, in Scotland, the law gives the benefice, without any exception to the person presented by the patron; yet the church requires sometimes (for she has not in this respect been very uniform in her decisions) a certain concurrence of the people, before she will confer upon the presentee what is called the cure of souls, or the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the parish. She sometimes, at least, from an affected concern for the peace of the parish, delays the settlement till this concurrence can be procured. The private tampering of some of the neighbouring clergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently to prevent this concurrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate, in order to enable them upon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are perhaps the causes which principally keep up whatever remains of the old fanatical spirit, either in the clergy or in the people of Scotland.\n\nThe equality which the presbyterian form of church government establishes among the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice. In all presbyterian churches, the equality of authority is perfect; that of benefice is not so. The difference, however, between one benefice and another, is seldom so considerable, as commonly to tempt the possessor even of the small one to pay court to his patron, by the vile arts of flattery and assentation, in order to get a better. In all the presbyterian churches, where the rights of patronage are thoroughly established, it is by nobler and better arts, that the established clergy in general endeavour to gain the favour of their superiors; by their learning, by the irreproachable regularity of their life, and by the faithful and diligent discharge of their duty. Their patrons even frequently complain of the independency of their spirit, which they are apt to construe into ingratitude for past favours, but which, at worse, perhaps, is seldom anymore than that indifference which naturally arises from the consciousness that no further favours of the kind are ever to be expected. There is scarce, perhaps, to be found anywhere in Europe, a more learned, decent, independent, and respectable set of men, than the greater part of the presbyterian clergy of Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, and Scotland.\n\nWhere the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be very great; and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may be, no doubt, carried too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects. Nothing but exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. The vices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and are, besides, almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his own conduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that system of morals which the common people respect the most. He gains their esteem and affection, by that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead him to follow. The common people look upon him with that kindness with which we naturally regard one who approaches somewhat to our own condition, but who, we think, ought to be in a higher. Their kindness naturally provokes his kindness. He becomes careful to instruct them, and attentive to assist and relieve them. He does not even despise the prejudices of people who are disposed to be so favourable to him, and never treats them with those contemptuous and arrogant airs, which we so often meet with in the proud dignitaries of opulent and well endowed churches. The presbyterian clergy, accordingly, have more influence over the minds of the common people, than perhaps the clergy of any other established church. It is, accordingly, in presbyterian countries only, that we ever find the common people converted, without persecution completely, and almost to a man, to the established church.\n\nIn countries where church benefices are, the greater part of them, very moderate, a chair in a university is generally a better establishment than a church benefice. The universities have, in this case, the picking and chusing of their members from all the churchmen of the country, who, in every country, constitute by far the most numerous class of men of letters. Where church benefices, on the contrary, are many of them very considerable, the church naturally draws from the universities the greater part of their eminent men of letters; who generally find some patron, who does himself honour by procuring them church preferment. In the former situation, we are likely to find the universities filled with the most eminent men of letters that are to be found in the country. In the latter, we are likely to find few eminent men among them, and those few among the youngest members of the society, who are likely, too, to be drained away from it, before they can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to be of much use to it. It is observed by Mr. de Voltaire, that father Por\u00e9e, a jesuit of no great eminence in the republic of letters, was the only professor they had ever had in France, whose works were worth the reading. In a country which has produced so many eminent men of letters, it must appear somewhat singular, that scarce one of them should have been a professor in a university. The famous Cassendi was, in the beginning of his life, a professor in the university of Aix. Upon the first dawning of his genius, it was represented to him, that by going into the church he could easily find a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence, as well as a better situation for pursuing his studies; and he immediately followed the advice. The observation of Mr. de Voltaire may be applied, I believe, not only to France, but to all other Roman Catholic countries. We very rarely find in any of them an eminent man of letters, who is a professor in a university, except, perhaps, in the professions of law and physic; professions from which the church is not so likely to draw them. After the church of Rome, that of England is by far the richest and best endowed church in Christendom. In England, accordingly, the church is continually draining the universities of all their best and ablest members; and an old college tutor who is known and distinguished in Europe as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to be found there as in any Roman catholic country, In Geneva, on the contrary, in the protestant cantons of Switzerland, in the protestant countries of Germany, in Holland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most eminent men of letters whom those countries have produced, have, not all indeed, but the far greater part of them, been professors in universities. In those countries, the universities are continually draining the church of all its most eminent men of letters.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be worth while to remark, that, if we except the poets, a few orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other eminent men of letters, both of Greece and Rome, appear to have been either public or private teachers; generally either of philosophy or of rhetoric. This remark will be found to hold true, from the days of Lysias and Isocrates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those of Plutarch and Epictetus, Suetonius, and Quintilian. To impose upon any man the necessity of teaching, year after year, in any particular branch of science seems in reality to be the most effectual method for rendering him completely master of it himself. By being obliged to go every year over the same ground, if he is good for any thing, he necessarily becomes, in a few years, well acquainted with every part of it, and if, upon any particular point, he should form too hasty an opinion one year, when he comes, in the course of his lectures to reconsider the same subject the year thereafter, he is very likely to correct it. As to be a teacher of science is certainly the natural employment of a mere man of letters; so is it likewise, perhaps, the education which is most likely to render him a man of solid learning and knowledge. The mediocrity of church benefices naturally tends to draw the greater part of men of letters in the country where it takes place, to the employment in which they can be the most useful to the public, and at the same time to give them the best education, perhaps, they are capable of receiving. It tends to render their learning both as solid as possible, and as useful as possible.\nThe revenue of every established church, such parts of it excepted as may arise from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to be observed, of the general revenue of the state, which is thus diverted to a purpose very different from the defence of the state. The tithe, for example, is a real land tax, which puts it out of the power of the proprietors of land to contribute so largely towards the defence of the state as they otherwise might be able to do. The rent of land, however, is, according to some, the sole fund; and, according to others, the principal fund, from which, in all great monarchies, the exigencies of the state must be ultimately supplied. The more of this fund that is given to the church, the less, it is evident, can be spared to the state. It may be laid down as a certain maxim, that all other things being supposed equal, the richer the church, the poorer must necessarily be, either the sovereign on the one hand, or the people on the other; and, in all cases, the less able must the state be to defend itself. In several protestant countries, particularly in all the protestant cantons of Switzerland, the revenue which anciently belonged to the Roman catholic church, the tithes and church lands, has been found a fund sufficient, not only to afford competent salaries to the established clergy, but to defray, with little or no addition, all the other expenses of the state. The magistrates of the powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated, out of the savings from this fund, a very large sum, supposed to amount to several millions; part or which is deposited in a public treasure, and part is placed at interest in what are called the public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe; chiefly in those of France and Great Britain. What may be the amount of the whole expense which the church, either of Berne, or of any other protestant canton, costs the state, I do not pretend to know. By a very exact account it appears, that, in 1755, the whole revenue of the clergy of the church of Scotland, including their glebe or church lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses, estimated according to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to \u00a368,514:1:5 1/12d. This very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence to nine hundred and forty-four ministers. The whole expense of the church, including what is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of churches, and of the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to exceed eighty or eighty-five thousand pounds a-year. The most opulent church in Christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith, the fervour of devotion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere morals, in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed church of Scotland. All the good effects, both civil and religious, which an established church can be supposed to produce, are produced by it as completely as by any other. The greater part of the protestant churches of Switzerland, which, in general, are not better endowed than the church of Scotland, produce those effects in a still higher degree. In the greater part of the protestant cantons, there is not a single person to be found, who does not profess himself to be of the established church. If he professes himself to be of any other, indeed, the law obliges him to leave the canton. But so severe, or, rather, indeed, so oppressive a law, could never have been executed in such free countries, had not the diligence of the clergy beforehand converted to the established church the whole body of the people, with the exception of, perhaps, a few individuals only. In some parts of Switzerland, accordingly, where, from the accidental union of a protestant and Roman catholic country, the conversion has not been so complete, both religions are not only tolerated, but established by law.\n\nThe proper performance of every service seems to require, that its pay or recompence should be, as exactly as possible, proportioned to the nature of the service. If any service is very much underpaid, it is very apt to suffer by the meanness and incapacity of the greater part of those who are employed in it. If it is very much overpaid, it is apt to suffer, perhaps still more, by their negligence and idleness. A man of a large revenue, whatever may be his profession, thinks he ought to live like other men of large revenues; and to spend a great part of his time in festivity, in vanity, and in dissipation. But in a clergyman, this train of life not only consumes the time which ought to be employed in the duties of his function, but in the eyes of the common people, destroys almost entirely that sanctity of character, which can alone enable him to perform those duties with proper weight and authority.\n\nPART IV. Of the Expense of supporting the Dignity of the Sovereign.\n\nOver and above the expenses necessary for enabling the sovereign to perform his several duties, a certain expense is requisite for the support of his dignity. This expense varies, both with the different periods of improvement, and with the different forms of government.\n\nIn an opulent and improved society, where all the different orders of people are growing every day more expensive in their houses, in their furniture, in their tables, in their dress, and in their equipage; it cannot well be expected that the sovereign should alone hold out against the fashion. He naturally, therefore, or rather necessarily, becomes more expensive in all those different articles too. His dignity even seems to require that he should become so.\n\nAs, in point of dignity, a monarch is more raised above his subjects than the chief magistrate of any republic is ever supposed to be above his fellow-citizens; so a greater expense is necessary for supporting that higher dignity. We naturally expect more splendour in the court of a king, than in the mansion-house of a doge or burgo-master.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe expense of defending the society, and that of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate, are both laid out for the general benefit of the whole society. It is reasonable, therefore, that they should be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society; all the different members contributing, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities.\n\nThe expense of the administration of justice, too, may no doubt be considered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society. There is no impropriety, therefore, in its being defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society. The persons, however, who give occasion to this expense, are those who, by their injustice in one way or another, make it necessary to seek redress or protection from the courts of justice. The persons, again, most immediately benefited by this expense, are those whom the courts of justice either restore to their rights, or maintain in their rights. The expense of the administration of justice, therefore, may very properly be defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other, or both, of those two different sets of persons, according as different occasions may require, that is, by the fees of court. It cannot be necessary to have recourse to the general contribution of the whole society, except for the conviction of those criminals who have not themselves any estate or fund sufficient for paying those fees.\nThose local or provincial expenses, of which the benefit is local or provincial (what is laid out, for example, upon the police of a particular town or district), ought to be defrayed by a local or provincial revenue, and ought to be no burden upon the general revenue of the society. It is unjust that the whole society should contribute towards an expense, of which the benefit is confined to a part of the society.\n\nThe expense of maintaining good roads and communications is, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without any injustice, be defrayed by the general contributions of the whole society. This expense, however, is most immediately and directly beneficial to those who travel or carry goods from one place to another, and to those who consume such goods. The turnpike tolls in England, and the duties called peages in other countries, lay it altogether upon those two different sets of people, and thereby discharge the general revenue of the society from a very considerable burden.\n\nThe expense of the institutions for education and religious instruction, is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society. This expense, however, might, perhaps, with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for either the one or the other.\n\nWhen the institutions, or public works, which are beneficial to the whole society, either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained altogether, by the contribution of such particular members of the society as are most immediately benefited by them; the deficiency must, in most cases, be made up by the general contribution of the whole society. The general revenue of the society, over and above defraying the expense of defending the society, and of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate, must make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of revenue. The sources of this general or public revenue, I shall endeavour to explain in the following chapter.", "http://genius.com/Adam-smith-an-inquiry-into-the-nature-and-causes-of-the-wealth-of-nations-chap-51-annotated"], "156067": ["Chicago Police Torture Summary of Evidence by\u00a0University\u00a0of Chicago", "Chicago Police Torture Summary of Evidence Lyrics\n\nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE OF MONELL POLICY AND PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND COVER-UP, AND OF DEFENDANTS MARTIN\u2019S, SHINES\u2019, NEEDHAM\u2019S AND HILLARD\u2019S INVOLVEMENT [REDACTED]\n\n1. Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States\u2019 Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.\n\n2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M.

Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.\n\n4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson\u2019s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case\u201d Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v.

On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2\n\n7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O\u2019Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to \u201cmess with\u201d Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson\u2019s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge\u2019s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 \u00bd-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson\u2019s nose and one on Wilson\u2019s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O\u2019Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson\u2019s testimony, with O\u2019Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, \u201cYou want me to make a statement after they\u2019ve been torturing me?\u201d O\u2019Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, \u201cFun time.\u201d Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson\u2019s other arm and another pair on Wilson\u2019s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson\u2019s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson\u2019s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson\u2019s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson\u2019s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson\u2019s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to \u201cfry his black ass.\u201d Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.\n\n8. In February of 1992, Andrew Wilson testified before the Police Board on behalf of the City in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O\u2019Hara, Cases # 1856-58, and described his torture in a manner consistent with how the City described it in its January 22, 1992 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, at pp. 4-6; Police Board Testimony of Andrew Wilson.\n\n9. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, the City of Chicago, who was a Defendant in that case, admitted in its Amended Answer, dated July 13, 1995, that Andrew Wilson was tortured by Jon Burge on February 14, 1982.\n\n10. Melvin Jones testified on August 5, 1982 at his motion to suppress hearing that he was arrested and transported to Area 2 at 92nd and Cottage Grove on February 5, 1982, and 4 placed in an interview room. People v. Melvin Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 61-62.\n\n11. Melvin Jones testified that while being held in an interview room and interrogated, Lieutenant Jon Burge pulled up a chair and sat in front of Jones who was cuffed to the wall, that Burge had a little wooden box with a long cord, that Burge pulled down Jones\u2019 pants to his ankles and electrically shocked Jones on his foot, then on his thigh and then on his penis. Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn\u2019t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, \u201c[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant\u2019s word,\u201d and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.\n\n12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn\u2019t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones\u2019 head and said\nhe was going to \u201cblow Jones\u2019 black head off.\u201d Id. pp. 76-79.\n\n13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] \u201chad got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.\u201d Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.\n\n14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones\u2019 attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box. Chicago Police Board Proceedings, 2/19/92, pp. 960-62.\n\n15. Jones testified on behalf of the City in the Police Board proceedings against Burge, and again identified Burge as the person who tortured him. Id., p. 826).\n\n16. In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson\u2019s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would \u201cwish he had never set eyes on him.\u201d Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10\" x 6\" x 6\", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones\u2019 pants and shorts and, using\nthe electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked \u201cSatan\u201d (Anthony Holmes) and \u201cCochise,\u201d forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant\u2019s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones\u2019 mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones\u2019 head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to \u201cblow his black head off.\u201d 6\nCity and Martin\u2019s Memorandum In Opposition, pp. 7-8.\n\n17. On May 15, 1995, the City of Chicago admitted that Melvin Jones had been\nelectrically shocked by Jon Burge on his genitals and thigh with a device in a wooden box and threatened with a gun, while he was handcuffed to a ring in the wall in an Area 2 interview room in an attempt to coerce a confession from him.

See, Generally, Depositions of Burge, Byrne, et. al.\n\n24. In a memo dated October 24, 1984, which was addressed to OPS supervisors, OPS Director David Fogel directed that they submit reports listing allegations of the use of electric shocking devices by Chicago police during the last 12 month period.\n\n25. In an October 29, 1984 memo to Fogel, OPS Supervisor Ann Peterson set forth two cases of electric shock.\n\n26.

On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as\n\u201ccompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:\nAs to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.\nOPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).\n\n93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while\napproving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did \u201ca masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.\u201d 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.\n\n94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved \u201cas\ncompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on \u201cthe overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations\u201d that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they \u201crepeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s body in order to create pain\u201d and that Burge \u201cheld Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson\u2019s face, chest and thigh.\u201d Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.\n\n95. Martin acknowledged the \u201c serious nature\u201d of Goldston\u2019s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.\n\n96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.\n\n97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking \u201cfurther\nclarification\u201d concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.\n\n98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the\nevidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.\n\n99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the \u201cclarifications\u201d sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings \u201creflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.\u201d Shines memo, 4/30/91.\n\n100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director\nShines included investigator Goldston\u2019s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O\u2019Hara were \u201cplayers\u201d\nwhose names \u201crepeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.\u201d Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.\n\n101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the\nChicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).\n\n102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.\n\n103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen\u2019s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.\n\n104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel\u2019s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.\n\n105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly\nWelsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley \u201cdefended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state\u2019s attorney in 1982, explaining that . .

Dillon, #90-C-6722.\n\n107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,\nSuperintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, \u201c13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,\u201d February 8, 1992.\n\n108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M.

The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes\nor to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.\n\n110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the \u201cseven\nadditional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters\u201d as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,\nGeorge Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-\n14.\n111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts\ntestimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,\nLeroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree\n[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects\nto elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] methods of torture\nthrough electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect\u2019s head are more that\nsufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the\ntestimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways\nto elicit confessions to violent crimes.\nId. p. 17.\n112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nclearly establishes respondents\u2019 [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] motive and intent in\ntorturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these\nsimilar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.\nId. p. 22. 25\n113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nshows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to\nand subsequent to Wilson\u2019s arrest, and Burge\u2019s possession of and familiarity with the use\nof the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the\nbagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting\na gun to the head of a victim.\nId., p. 24.\n114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:\nThere is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s testimony\nand the similar victims\u2019 testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.\nBurge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was\nnot the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the\nvictim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his\nknowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken\ninstead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the\nvictims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.\nAlso similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with\nconsequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the\npunishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the\nrefusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the\nmethods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using\nthe black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,\nwas \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,\nHolmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,\nPowell, White and Mumin were all \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten to the point where they lost or\nalmost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones\u2019s head, hit Poree in the\nhead with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin\u2019s head and\nsnapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each\nof the victims was slapped around and punched.\nBurge\u2019s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones\nand Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation\nto Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin\u2019s body. He said \u201cfun time\u201d as 26\nhe approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged\nMumin. He told Wilson he would \u201cfry his black ass\u201d and Jones he would \u201cblow his\nblack head off.\u201d\nAs the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of\nthese actions are overwhelming in their similarity.\nId., pp. 25-26.\n115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the\nfollowing judicial admission:\nGiven the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the\nsimilar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time\nto be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of\nalmost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.\nWhile the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to\nconnect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones\u2019 and Donald\nWhite\u2019s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew\nWilson was tortured.\nId., p. 28.\n116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:\nIndeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and\nO\u2019Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict\nwhen they persisted in their pattern of torture.\nId., p. 28.\n117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick\nO\u2019Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled \u201cCity of Chicago\u2019s Memorandum in Response\nTo Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers,\nmade the following judicial admission:\nPlaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by\nbeing harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27\nbetween his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that\nthis outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which\ndefendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants\u2019 scope of\nemployment.\nCity Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.\n118.

City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled\n\u201cCity of Chicago\u2019s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for\nSummary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:\nThe instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant\nofficers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any\nevidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black\nbox device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.\nId., p. 17.\n119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for\nSummary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that\nBurge \u201ccruelly torture[d]\u201d Andrew Wilson and \u201cdenie[d] him necessary medical\nassistance.\u201d\nId., p. 19.\n120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission\nconcerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson\nto asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge\u2019s\nemployment: \u201cThe change in the City\u2019s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the\nCity in good faith and in the public interest.\u201d Id. p. 12.\n121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received\nthe Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police\nMatt Rodriguez. After noting that because \u201changings, shockings, \u2018baggings\u2019 beatings, chokings,\nand beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and\nrigorous investigation seemed required,\u201d and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture\nalleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston\u2019s methodology. Police Foundation 28\nReport, \u201cAn Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,\u201d\n7/30/92.\n122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police\nDepartment investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston\nReport, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate\nthem, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id.\n123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines\nreopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and\nassigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including\nthose of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison\nHobley, were not opened or reopened.

OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in\nhis 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report.\n128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange\u2019s trial that they were\npartners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2\nHeadquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34.\n129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks\non his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that \u201cother things happened.\u201d\nPeople v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3.\n130. Orange\u2019s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing\nthat he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted\non the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured.

Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during\nwhich, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes\u2019 head,\ncausing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock\ndevice, housed in a black box, to Holmes\u2019 handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock,\nwhich caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely\npainful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth.\nMemorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9.\n143. On April 19, 2004 Anthony Holmes gave a Court reported statement in which he\ndescribed the allegations made in Plaintiff\u2019s Proffer in even greater detail.\n144.

In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge\nShadur stated the following in his decision:\nIt is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander\nJon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33\nand torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and\nnumerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that\nthose beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on\nan isolated basis.\n150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US\nex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement\nfrom the bench: \u201cterrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed\nof our police force and justice system.\u201d\n151.

He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois\noverzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He\nwas, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his\nemployment.\n152. OPS investigator Veronica [Tillman] Messenger was assigned to investigate the reopened Darrel Cannon OPS complaint (CR #134723) in May, 1993. CR # 134723, TillmanMessenger Testimony, People v.

Cannon, Dr.\nRobert Kirschner testified as an expert that he was a forensic pathologist, a member of the\nHuman Rights Program at the University of Chicago, a forensic consultant to physicians for\nhuman rights, that he had participated in several missions and investigations around the world\ninvestigating police and other governmental torture, that over the past 15 years he has evaluated\napproximately 200 torture victims around the world, and that he has often been called on to\nevaluate whether there is systematic torture being practiced by the police and other\ngovernmental authorities. Kirschner further testified that he has done much of his work on\nbehalf of the United Nations, for whom he has written portions of a protocol which defines the\nmethodologies of torture and how to properly investigate and evaluate cases of alleged torture.\nPeople v. Cannon, 11/1/99, pp. 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.\n345.

Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.\n346. Dr. Kirschner further testified that in his opinion there was a pattern and practice\nof torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that\nthis opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71\nvictims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins,\ndiscussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2,\nthe fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from\nArea 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not\nagainst other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2\nand 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and\nevaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.\n347. In an affidavit executed in August of 2004, Richard Brzeczek averred that he was\nthe Chicago Police Superintendent from January 11, 1980 until April 29,1983. Affidavit of\nRichard Brzeczek, \u00b61.\n348. Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements\nto Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune\narticle:\nTwenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is \u2018no doubt in my\nmind\u2019 that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2\n[was] a disgrace and an embarrassment. It\u2019s time something is done about it,\u201d Brzeczek\nsaid, referring to the former Burnside station on the southside where most of the torture\nallegedly occurred.\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n349. Brzeczek further averred that \u201csubsequent to [his] resignation from the Chicago\nPolice Department, [he] monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or\nallegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area\n2. [He] further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2\nbased on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72\nbefore the Chicago police Board. [He] also monitored media coverage of allegations and legal\nactions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons\nagainst police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.\u201d Id., \u00b6 10.\n350. Brzeczek further averred that \u201cbased on the fact that allegations continued to arise\nalleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after [he] left the Chicago\nPolice Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State\u2019s\nAttorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action),\nany investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as\naforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be\ntortured.\u201d Id., \u00b611.\n351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that \u201cbased on the sheer number of the\nallegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the\nDetective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for\ntheir roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while\nassigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were\ntortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.\u201d Id., \u00b612.\n352.

And its, do you acknowledge - - -\nA: Including, including the Chicago Police Department.\nCity Council Hearing, Committee on Police, Fire an Municipal Institutions, Public\nHearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285.\n357. On October 11, 1989, Police Superintendent Leroy Martin testified before the\nChicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following question by Alderman\nCaldwell:\nQ: One final question, Superintendent, and this was asked of Dr. Fogel on\nnumerous occasions.

On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d to the Mayor of the City of Chicago\nin which he wrote:\nBy accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the\npublic, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite\noccurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process\nand endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police\nfrom internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous \u201cpaper storm\u201d\nand has institutionalized lying.\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d October 19, 1987, p. 2.\n359. [Deleted]\n360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76\nCourt of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors\nand commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,\nand Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for\nconspiracy to \u201crailroad\u201d 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nWe cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the\nindividual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to\nrailroad George Jones.\nJones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.\n361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the\nCity of Chicago for maintaining a \u201cstreet files\u201dcustom or policy which led to the railroading of\n18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nThe custom in question is the maintenance of the \"street files,\" police\nfiles withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a\nsource of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute\nor, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As\nwe noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government\nwitness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.\nHerrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).\nAlthough the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been\nadjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge\nthe jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process\nof law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written\nrecords of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent\nthe rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files\ndeliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be\ntolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in\nthis court.\nThere is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files\nplayed a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821\nF.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]\naccess to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by\nLaverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77\ncounsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have\nended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was\na custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide\nand of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been\nconsciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions\ninvolving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent\nplurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.\nCt. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,\n273 (5th Cir. 1988).\nJones, 856 F. 2d at 995.\n362.

Jerry Mahaffey further testified that he appeared in Branch 66 on September 6,\n1983, and that an order was signed at that time requesting an examination by a physician at\nCermak Hospital and that the Judge in Branch 66 also stated on the record that Jerry Mahaffey\nhad discoloration on the right side of his chest 4-5 inches below his right nipple which was 3\ninches in length and one inch in width. Id. at 750-51.\n365. Sergeant Byrne admitted at his March 1, 2001 deposition in People v.

Wilson v.\nCity of Chicago, 6/27/89, pp. 1874-76).\n378. Porch further testified that Sergeant X took out his revolver, unloaded it, put one\nbullet back in the gun, spun the barrel and pointed it at him and Golden. He further testified that\nX also stepped on his groin. Id. at 1877-79.\n379. Porch further testified that he was then taken to a second interview room where\nSgt.

Judge Duff, the Judge in Wilson v. City of Chicago, ruled that Burge\u2019s name could\nnot be used by Porch before the jury; hence Porch referred to Burge as Sergeant X in his Wilson\ntestimony. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6/27/89, pp. 1874-92.\n384. Timothy Thompson testified at his motion to suppress hearing on May 24, 1984 that\nhe was arrested by Jon Burge and other officers on September 29, 1979, he was choked and hit\nin the eye by one of the arresting officers at the time he was arrested, that he was taken in a\nsquad car by Burge and another Area 2 detective to the police station at 90th and Cottage Grove,\nand he was questioned by Burge and this detective at the police station People v.

In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent\nTerry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the\nsignators wrote:\nWe write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with\npolice violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several\nOffice of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open\ninvestigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been\nconducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the\nobvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS\nand police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS.\nAugust 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird.\n588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113\nRecent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the\nOPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS\nfindings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986\nincluded \"psychological techniques and planned torture,\" was \"systematic,\" and\n\"methodical,\" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, \"were aware\nof the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or\nfailing to take any action to bring it to an end.\" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public\nevidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted\nthorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available\nduring the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained\nfindings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic\nbag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The\nevidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police\nofficers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably\nLieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him\nin five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the\ninvestigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,\nand that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at\nthe same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for\nmerit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500\nsustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she\noverturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.\nThe evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley\nHoward, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but\nrather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.\nCannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought\nthese files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,\nwhich contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS\nin 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files\nfrom the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the\nsustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state\u2019s\nattorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including\nCannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on\nthe merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines\u2019\noffice for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the\nmerits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel\u2019s\nunjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.\nAdditionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous\nadditional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the\ncase of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen\u2019s Alert specifically requested by a letter\ndated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed\nallegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2\ndetectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no\ninvestigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114\nofficial court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin\ncase, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new\nevidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS\ninvestigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,\nsupposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.\nIn numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are\npresently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from\nthem, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious\nallegations.\nId.\n589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:\n1. Given Ms. Shines\u2019 clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her\nreview of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie\nBaird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture\ncases;\n2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the\nSuperintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by\npolice procedure to do;\n3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or\notherwise participating in any torture investigations;\n4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were\nentered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review;\n5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin\nJones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider\nin making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured;\n6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin\ninvestigation;\n7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous\ndocumented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto,\nincluding those allegations made by men on death row;\n8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious\nviolations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS\nofficials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines;\n9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the\nundersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the\nprogress of these investigations;\n10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.\nId. 115\n590.

Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and\nGeorges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative\npublicity about Burge and the City\u2019s role in the torture scandal. Id.\n598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide\nvariety of reasons, including that some of Burge\u2019s men were still on the police force, the\ndepartment had been embarrassed by Needham\u2019s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture\ninvestigations despite the investigators\u2019 sustained findings, and that the Tribune\u2019s then recent\nseries on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention\non the issue, and Given further stated \u201cbut query how we\u2019ll do in the court of public opinion\nafter a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?\u201d NBC5.com; Chicago\nTribune.\n599.

Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.\n2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:\n[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the\nhigh price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a\ncloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of\nevidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station\nof the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to\nHinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of\nProfessional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the\nallegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the\ncommand of Lt. Jon Burge \u2014 the officer in charge of Hinton's case \u2014 had been a\nregular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent\nof the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,\nthe report said that \"[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual\nbeating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and\nplanned torture.\" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew\nWilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by\nBurge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and\nrepeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People\nv. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the\npolice, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon\nBurge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,\nBurge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he\nat least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118\n\"Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,\" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002\n(editorial); Hal Dardick, \"Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander\nstays mum on torture questions,\" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations\nthat Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects\nbetween August 1972 and September 1991). . . .\nBehavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it\ncreates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers\nwould abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in\nwhich the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so\nextreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), which defines torture as\n\"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\nintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a\nthird person information or a confession . . .,\" thereby violating the fundamental\nhuman rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .", "http://genius.com/University-of-chicago-chicago-police-torture-summary-of-evidence-annotated"], "356954": ["Modernism and Imperialism by\u00a0Fredric\u00a0Jameson", "Modernism and Imperialism Lyrics\n\nMODERNISM AND IMPERIALISM\n\nFREDRIC JAMESON\n\n\nThis is a time in which, at least in part owing to what is called postmodernism, there seems to be renewed interest in finding out what modernism really was (note the past tense), and in rethinking that now historical phenomenon in new ways, which are not those we have inherited from the participants and the players, the advocates and the practitioners themselves. But this has also been a time, over perhaps an even longer span of years, in which the matter of what imperialism is (note the tense) and how it functions has been a subject of intense debate and discussion among the theorists, and not only the economists, the historians, and the political scientists. A range of very complex theories and models indeed\u2014probably more incomprehensible than most forms of contemporary literary theory\u2014have come into being which any serious discussion of this issue has to acknowledge\n\nAny discussion of the relationship of modernism and imperialism will therefore generally require, not one, but two lengthy preambles, before it reaches its topic. It is, however, important to be clear in advance of what the topic is: it will not, in the present case, involve what can be called the literature of imperialism, since that literature (Kipling, Rider Haggard, Verne, Wells) is by and large not modernist in any formal sense, and, emerging from subcanonical genres like the adventure tale, remained \"minor\" or \"marginal\" during the hegemony of the modern and its ideology and values (even Conrad explicitly draws on more archaic storytelling forms).(1)\n\nThe hypothesis to be explored here is both more formalistic and more sweeping than the affirmation that imperialism as such produced its specific literature and left palpable traces on the content of other metropolitan(2) literary works of the period. I want in fact to suggest that the structure of imperialism also makes its mark on the inner forms and structures of that new mutation in literary and artistic language to which the term modernism is loosely applied. This last has of course multiple social determinants: any general theory of the modern\u2014assuming one to be possible in the first place\u2014would also wish to register the informing presence of a range of other historically novel phenomena: modernization and technology; commodity reification; monetary abstraction and its effects on the sign system; the social dialectic of reading publics; the emergence of mass culture; the embodiment of new forms of the psychic subject on the physical sensorium. Nor is the relative weight and importance of the emergence of a whole new global and imperial system in this constellation of \"factors\" at all clear, even in a speculative way. The present essay is limited to the isolation of this determinant alone, the presence of a new force, which cannot be reduced to any of those aforementioned\n\nHowever extrinsic and extraliterary the fact of imperialism may at first seem, there is at least a chronological justification for exploring its influence. If we take, as the codification of the new imperialist world system, the emblematic date of 1884\u2014the year of the Berlin Conference, which parceled Africa out among the \"advanced\" powers\u2014a whole range of literary and artistic events spring to mind which at the very least suggest analogous breaks and emergences: the death of Victor Hugo in the following year, for example, has often been seen as the inaugural moment of that whole new symbolist and Mallarmean aesthetic which his disappearance suddenly revealed to have already existed in full development behind his massive presence. The choice of such emblematic breaks is not an empirically verifiable matter but a historiographic decision; nor are chronological parallels of this kind much more at the outset than incentives to construct new and more complex and interesting historical narratives, whose usefulness cannot be predicted before the fact. But when, as we shall see, the parallel also seems to hold at the other end of such chronological series and the end of modernism to coincide with the restructuration of the classical imperialist world system, our curiosity as to possible interrelationships can surely only be sharpened, even if it has been restricted in another way\n\nFor the emphasis on form and formal innovation and modification implies that our privileged texts and objects of study here will be those that scarcely evoke imperialism as such at all; that seem to have no specifically political content in the first place; that offer purely stylistic or linguistic peculiarities for analysis. One of the more commonly held stereotypes about the modern has of course in general been that of its apolitical character, its turn inward and away from the social materials associated with realism, its increased subjectification and introspective psychologization, and, not least, its aestheticism and its ideological commitment to the supreme value of a now autonomous Art as such. None of these characterizations strikes me as adequate or persuasive any longer; they are part of the baggage of an older modernist ideology which any contemporary theory of the modern will wish to scrutinize and to dismantle. But there is something to be said in the present context, for beginning with the formalist stereotype of the modern, if only to demonstrate with greater force the informing presence of the extraliterary, of the political and the economic within it.(3)\n\nBut such is not the only restriction on the present topic: it also involves some restrictions that concern its other term\u2014imperialism as such, which must also now be delimited. I take it, for instance, that only those theories of imperialism which acknowledge the Marxist problematic (in however heretical or revisionist a fashion) are of concern here since it is only within that problematic that a coordination between political phenomena (violence, domination, control, state power) and economic phenomena (the market, investment, exploitation, underconsumption, crisis) is systematically pursued. Exclusively political theories of imperialism (such as Schumpeter's) slip not merely toward moralizing, but also toward metaphysical notions of human nature (the lust for power or domination), which end up dissolving the historical specificity of the thing itself and disperse the phenomenon of imperialism throughout human history, wherever bloody conquests are to be found (which is to say: everywhere!). At any rate, if it is the link between imperialism and modernism that is in question here (and between imperialism and Western modernism at that), then clearly imperialism must here mean the imperialist dynamic of capitalism proper, and not the wars of conquest of the various ancient empires\n\nBut even in the case of Marxist theories of imperialism, a further historical qualification now needs to be set in place: namely, that the Marxist approach to imperialism is crucially modified and restructured in the mid-twentieth century.(4) People generally remember that Lenin wrote a very influential pamphlet on imperialism during World War I; they probably suspect anyone who uses this word \"imperialism\" too frequently of being a Marxist; and if they have had any greater exposure to these discussions, they know that the term has something to do with the problems of Third World societies and with underdevelopment, with the debt as well, with the IMF and American investments and bases abroad, with support for dictators and anxieties about Soviet influence, and perhaps only ultimately\u2014in the last instance!\u2014with marines and gunboat intervention or with a formal colonial structure. What must now be observed is that the term \"imperialism\" when used in the so-called Marxian classics\u2014in Marx himself, in Lenin, in Hilferding and in Bukharin, with a certain exceptionality for the work of Rosa Luxemburg\u2014has none of these connotations. For the most part, the older Marxist theorists of imperialism followed Marx himself (in the famous letters on India) in assuming that capitalist penetration would lead directly to positive economic development in what are now known as Third World countries. The very widely held contemporary belief\u2014that, following the title of Walter Rodney's influential book, capitalism leads on the contrary to \"the development of underdevelopment,\" and that imperialism systematically cripples the growth of its colonies and its dependent areas\u2014this belief is utterly absent from what may be called the first moment of Marxist theories of imperialism and is indeed everywhere explicitly contradicted by them, where they raise the matter at all.(5) The point is, however, that they do not often raise the matter in that form for the good reason that during this period the word \" imperialism\" designates, not the relationship of metropolis to colony, but rather the rivalry of the various imperial and metropolitan nation-states among themselves. It becomes immediately clear, then, that we risk all kinds of historical confusions and anachronisms if we ignore this usage and transfer our own contemporary sense of the word to contexts in the modernist period\n\nFor it is in our time, since World War II, that the problem of imperialism is as it were restructured: in the age of neocolonialism, of decolonization accompanied by the emergence of multinational capitalism and the great transnational corporations, it is less the rivalry of the metropolitan powers among each other that strikes the eye (our occasional problems with Japan, for example, do not project that impending World War-type conflict that nagged at the awareness of the belle \u00e9poque); rather, contemporary theorists, from Paul Baran on to the present day, have been concerned with the internal dynamics of the relationship between First and Third World countries, and in particular the way in which this relationship\u2014which is now very precisely what the word \"imperialism\" means for us\u2014is one of necessary subordination or dependency, and that of an economic type, rather than a primarily military one. This means that in the period from World War I to World War II the axis of otherness has as it were been displaced: it first governed the relationship of the various imperial subjects with each other; it now designates the relationship between a generalized imperial subject (most often the United States, but frequently enough also Britain or France and Japan, not to speak of those new kinds of metropolitan centers which are South Africa or Israel) and its various others or objects. That would be the historical way of putting it; but since (naturally enough) we think we have discovered some more basic truths about the dynamics of imperialism than our forefathers in Lenin\u2019s time, one could also describe the displacement this way: in that older period, from 1884 to World War I, the relationship of domination between First and Third World was masked and displaced by an overriding (and perhaps ideological) consciousness of imperialism as being essentially a relationship between First World powers or the holders of Empire, and this consciousness tended to repress the more basic axis of otherness, and to raise issues of colonial reality only incidentally.\n\nCulturally, the causes as well as the effects of this shift can be rapidly evoked. We think about the Third World in a different way today, not merely because of decolonization and political independence, but above all because these enormously varied cultures all now speak in their own distinctive voices. Nor are those voices any longer marginal ones that we are free to overlook; at least one of them\u2014Latin American literature, since the boom\u2014has today become perhaps the principal player on the scene of world culture, and has had an unavoidable and inescapable influence, not merely on other Third World cultures as such, but on First World literature and culture as well. It would be easy to demonstrate a presence of other such voices in First World cultural situations outside the United States as well, as for example in Britain today. Meanwhile, it is significant that in the United States itself, we have come to think and to speak of the emergence of an internal Third World and of internal Third World voices, as in black women's literature or Chicano literature for example. When the other speaks, he or she becomes another subject, which must be consciously registered as a problem by the imperial or metropolitan subject\u2014whence the turn of what are still largely Western theories of imperialism in a new direction, toward that other, and toward the structures of underdevelopment and dependency for which we are responsible.\n\nBut in the modernist period this is by no means the case. The prototypical paradigm of the Other in the late nineteenth century\u2014in Zola's La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle (1982), for example\u2014is the other imperial nation-state: in this case, the Germans, who are the quintessential ogres and bogeymen of childhood nightmare, physically alien and terrifying, barbarous, uncivilized, and still not terribly remote, as stereotypes, from the archaic \"wild man of the Middle Ages,\" who incarnates everything fascinating and frightening about the unbridled id for an agricultural or village society.(6) Such \"others\" will then circulate in paler and more respectable forms in high literature during this period\u2014as in the various foreigners who add an exotic note to high society in the English novel (E. M. Forster's Germans, in Howards End, function to reverse this xenophobia in a kind of therapeutic liberal tolerance and self-critique); while the more radical otherness of colonized, non-Western peoples tends to find its representational place in that noncanonical adventure literature of imperialism to which we have already referred\n\nBut this masking of one axis of otherness by a very different one, this substitution of rivalry for exploitation, and of a First World set of characters for a Third World presence, may be thought of as a strategy of representational containment, which scarcely alters the fundamental imperialist structure of colonial appropriation, or of what Jacques Berque has memorably called the \"d\u00e9possession du monde\" of the colonized peoples. Its effects are representational effects, which is to say a systematic block on any adequate consciousness of the structure of the imperial system: but these are just as clearly objective effects and will have their most obvious consequences in the aesthetic realm, where the mapping of the new imperial world system becomes impossible, since the colonized other who is its essential other component or opposite number has become invisible.\n\nIt is in this situation that modernist representation emerges, and this is indeed in general the relationship of formal and cultural change to what we have called its social \"determinants,\" which present a radically altered situation (new raw materials of a social, psychological, or physical type) to which a fresh and unprecendented aesthetic response is demanded, generally by way of formal, structural, and linguistic invention.(7) But what the new situation of imperialism looks like from the standpoint of cultural or aesthetic production now needs to be characterized, and its seems best to do so by distinguishing its problems from those of an internal industrialization and commodification in the modernizing metropolis. This last seems most often (paradoxically) to have been lived in terms of a generalized loss of meaning, as though its subject measured the increase in human power negatively, by way of the waning of tradition and religious absolutes, at the same time that the fact of praxis and production was only too susceptible to distortion by and concealment beneath the reifying logic and of the commodity form\n\nWhat is determined by the colonial system is now a rather different kind of meaning loss than this one: for colonialism means that a significant structural segment of the economic system as a whole is now located elsewhere, beyond the metropolis, outside of the daily life and existential experience of the home country, in colonies over the water whose own life experience and life world\u2014very different from that of the imperial power\u2014and unimaginable for the subjects of the imperial power, whatever social class they may belong to. Such spatial disjunction has as its immediate consequence the inability to grasp the way the system functions as a whole. Unlike the classical stage of national or market capitalism, then, pieces of the puzzle are missing; it can never be fully reconstructed; no enlargement of personal experience (in the knowledge of other social classes, for example), no intensity of self-examination (in the form of whatever social guilt), no scientific deductions on the basis of the internal evidence of First World data, can ever be enough to include this radical otherness of colonial life, colonial suffering, and exploitation, let alone the structural connections between that and this, between absent space and daily life in the metropolis. To put it in other words, this last\u2014daily life and existential experience in the metropolis\u2014which is necessarily the very content of the national literature itself, can now no longer be grasped immanently; it no longer has its meaning, its deeper reason for being, within itself. As artistic content it will now henceforth always have something missing about it, but in the sense of a privation that can never be restored or made whole simply by adding back in the missing component: its lack is rather comparable to another dimension, an outside like the other face of a mirror, which it constitutively lacks, and which can never be made up or made good. This new and historically original problem in what is itself a new kind of content now constitutes the situation and the problem and the dilemma, the formal contradiction, that modernism seeks to solve; or better still, it is only that new kind of art which reflexively perceives this problem and lives this formal dilemma that can be called modernism in the first place\n\nNow of course one's simplest first thought, faced with this problem of a global space that like the fourth dimension somehow constitutively escapes you, is no doubt to make a map: nor is Ulysses by any means the first, let alone the only, literary work of the imperialist period that stakes its bet on the properties of maps. The very title of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, whatever other resonances it comes to have, is literally determined by the reference to cartography. But cartography is not the solution, but rather the problem, at least in its ideal epistemological form as social cognitive mapping on the global scale. The map, if there is to be one, must somehow emerge from the demands and constraints of the spatial perceptions of the individual; and since Britain is generally thought of as the quintessential imperialist power, it may be useful to begin with a sample of English spatial experience:\n\nThe train sped northward, under innumerable tunnels. It was only an hour's journey, but Mrs. Munt had to raise and lower the window again and again. She passed through the South Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame. She traversed the immense viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of Tewin Water. She skirted the parks of politicians. At times the Great North Road accompanied her, more suggestive of infinity than any railway awakening, after a nap of a hundred years, to such life as is conferred by the stench of motorcars, and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills. To history, to tragedy, to the past, to the future, Mrs. Munt remained equally indifferent; hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey, and to rescue poor Helen from this dreadful mess.(8)\n\nThis episode, from the opening pages of Howards End, is characteristic of Forster's duplicities, and offers an amiable simplicity filled with traps and false leads. Pockets of philosophical complexity are hidden away beneath its surface, and they include reflections on nature and industrialization, on authentic and inauthentic existential time (Mrs. Munt's version of Heideggerian Sorge), and a firm but tactful consciousness of English class realities. The novel will then undertake to spell these out and to make sure that what the reader has been encouraged to overlook here becomes at length an unavoidable message, in terms of which we may then leaf back and gloss the present text in some detail. But it will remain a gloss on what is essentially a spatial representation and a spatial perception: the philosophical thoughts (which in any case involve space, as we shall see) will finally have been dependent on space, and inexpressible without it. This is of course a cinematographic kind of space, with its Einsteinian observer on a train moving through a landscape whose observation it alters at the very moment that it makes it possible. But what is most significant is not some possible influence of nascent cinema on Forster or on the modernist novel in general, but rather the confluence of the two distinct formal developments, of movie technology on the one hand, and of a certain type of modernist or protomodernist language on the other, both of which seem to offer some space, some third term, between the subject and the object alike. Cinematographic perception is in that sense neither subjective nor psychological: there is nothing private or personal about it (and it was for that reason that I suggested, above, that characterizations of the modern as some inward turn were misleading). But it is not objective either in any conventional sense of realism or empiricism: nothing is indeed quite so perverse or aberrant for the truly postmodern person as the polemic expression \"photographic realism\"\u2014as though photography, today so mysterious and contradictory an experience, had anything reassuringly trustworthy or reliable about it, for us a most unlikely guarantor of verisimilitude! This is why, although the category of style remains a fundamental one of the various modernisms, emerging with them and disappearing again when the psychic subject is notoriously eclipsed in the postmodern moment, it seems urgent to disjoin it from conventional notions of psychology and subjectivity: whence the therapeutic usefulness of the cinematographic parallel, where an apparatus takes the place of human psychology and perception. But this can most effectively be achieved by recoordinating the concept of style with some new account of the experience of space, both together now marking the emergence of the modern as such, and the place from which a whole bewilderingly varied set of modernisms begins to flourish\n\nForster, at best a closet modernist, may seem an unlikely enough illustration of this process; but it was its tendential emergence that interested us, and not the full-blown thing itself. Meanwhile, if it is argued that England, the very heartland of imperialism, is also that national terrain which seems to have been the least propitious for the development of any indigenous modernism,(9) then that is surely also relevant for our present topic\n\nYet at least one moment in the present passage seems to hold all the possibilities of some properly modernist language, past and future, instinct within itself, from Baudelaire to Eliot: a figure which speeds by like Mrs. Munt's surroundings, only its false modesty drawing attention to itself (as always in Forster). It is \"the Great North Road ... suggestive of infinity.\" One sees what is meant, of course, and the reader dutifully recomposes some inner film around the visual properties of the highway, its great sweep and curve away from the train tracks; its empty endlessness, on which a few (multiple) vehicles reinforce the investment of the observer by a single massive conveyance; its desolation, finally, denuded and thereby closer to the Idea than the unavoidable contamination of the railway interior by a modernizing and commercial history. This is at least what the figure gives us to see; but, particularly when you come to know that Forster continues to use the word \"infinity\" as though it really means something, the meaning itself grows less and less evident. Or perhaps it might be better to characterize this moment of a properly modernist style as one in which an appearance of meaning is pressed into the service of the notation of a physical perception. In fact, the reading problem turns on the objective uncertainty as to the structure of this figure: it is undecidable whether the Great North Road is the tenor or the vehicle; whether the roadway is intended, as in analogous moments in Baudelaire, to concretize the nebulous metaphysical concept, \"infinity,\" and by a momentary transfer of its visual properties to make that vague but lofty word a more vivid linguistic player in the textual game; or whether, on the other hand, it is rather the metaphysical prestige of the more noble Idea that is supposed to resonate back on the banal highway, lending it numen and thereby transforming it into the merest promise of expressivity without having to affirm it as some official \"symbol\" of the conventionally mendacious kind. Modernism is itself this very hesitation; it emerges in this spatial gap within Forster's figure; it is at one with the contradiction between the contingency of physical objects and the demand for an impossible meaning, here marked by dead philosophical abstraction. The solution to this contradiction, which we call \"style,\" is then the substitution of a spatial or perceptual \"meaning\" (whatever that now is) for the other kind (whatever that was, or might be in the future)\n\nBut Forster's figure also turns out to have a more conventional \"meaning,\" as the rest of his novel instructs us: it will be perfectly proper to unravel it, provided we do not lose sight of its initial spatial and perceptual ground, and of the work of some new modernist language on our bodies and our sensorium that is its precondition. He goes on, indeed, to develop his ethos of place, as \"the basis of all earthly beauty\" (204), which he elaborates into something like a twofold salvation system, the twin paths of intimate human relations and of an immediate landscape: \"We want to show him,\" says Margaret about the wretched Leonard Bast, \"how he may get upsides with life. As I said, either friends, or the country, some ... either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life's daily grey, and to show that it is grey. If possible, one should have both\" (145). The place is of course the country house itself, the Howards End of the title; and the \"dear person\" the late Mrs. Wilcox, who begins to merge with her dwelling to the point of becoming almost literally a \"genius loci.\" Yet the representational dilemma remains, as in our earlier figure: Mrs. Wilcox as a character draws her possibilities from that concrete place that is Howards End, while this last draws its evocative power from the spirit of Mrs. Wilcox. The transformation of chance encounters (\"only connect\") into a utopian social community presided over by a woman who is its providential spirit in a virtually literal sense;(10) and the recovery of a utopian landscape orchestrated by the well-nigh Shakespearean glorification of an ideal (and an anti patriotic) England in chapter XIX-the combination, indeed, the identification of these two visionary constructions is Forster's political as well as his aesthetic agenda in his novel.\n\nYet as he himself makes clear, it is not evident that the operation can be historically realized and completed (even though the novel itself gets written). For he will go on to suggest that the tendential conditions of modern civilization\u2014\u201cmodernization\" now, rather than aesthetic \"modernism\"!\u2014are in the process of closing off one of these two avenues of personal and spiritual \"salvation\" (if that is not too lofty a word for it). Landscape is in the process of being obliterated, leaving only the more fragile and ephemeral safety net of the interpersonal behind it:\n\nLondon was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilization, which is altering human nature so profoundly, and throws upon personal relations a stress greater than they have ever borne before. Under cosmopolitanism, if it comes, we shall receive no help from the earth. Trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle, and the binding force that they once exercized on character must be entrusted to Love alone. (261)\n\nBut what we must now add, and what now returns us to our starting point, is that London is very precisely that \"infinity\" of which we caught a glimpse on the Great North Road, or at least a \"caricature\" of it (Forster's word, p. 280). But now suddenly a whole set of terms falls into place and begins to coincide: cosmopolitanism, London, the nomadic, the stench of motorcars, antibilious pills, all begin to coalesce as a single historical tendency, and they are unexpectedly at one with \"infinity\" itself, which equally unexpectedly becomes the bad opposite of place, of Howards End, of the salvation through the here and the now (and incidentally of the regeneration of some older England that never existed, the utopian England of chapter XIX). But this is not simple romantic antiurban or antimodern nostalgia; it is not at all the conservative revulsion before the faceless industrial masses of the Waste Land, the modern urban world. And that for a final decisive reason, a final identification in this linked chain of phenomena: for infinity in this sense, this new grey placelessness, as well as what prepares it, also bears another familiar name. It is in Forster imperialism, or Empire, to give it its period designation. It is Empire which stretches the roads out to infinity, beyond the bounds and borders of the national state, Empire which leaves London behind it as a new kind of spatial agglomeration or disease, and whose commercialism now throws up those practical and public beings, like Mr. Wilcox, around whose repression of the personal Forster's message will also play, taking on new forms we have no time to examine here:\n\nIn the motorcar was another type whom Nature favors\u2014the Imperial. Healthy, ever in motion, it hopes to inherit the earth. It breads as quickly as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is the temptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his country's virtue overseas. But the Imperialist is not what he thinks or seems. He is a destroyer. He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism, and though his ambitions may be fulfilled, the earth that he inherits will be grey. (323)\n\nWith this identification\u2014the coincidence of \"infinity\" with \"imperialism\"\u2014we come full circle, and a component of the imperialist situation appears in human form, or in the representational language of a narrative character. Yet the representation is incomplete, and thereby epistemologically distorted and misleading: for we are only able to see that face, the \"Imperial type,\" turn inward, toward the internal metropolitan reality. The other pole of the relationship, what defines him fundamentally and essentially in his \"imperial\" function\u2014the persons of the colonized\u2014remains structurally occluded, and cannot but so remain, necessarily, as a result of the limits of the system, and the way in which internal national or metropolitan daily life is absolutely sundered from this other world henceforth in thrall to it.(11) But since representation, and cognitive mapping as such, is governed by an \"intention towards totality,\u201d(12) those limits must also be drawn back into the system, which marks them by an image, the image of the Great North Road as infinity: a new spatial language, therefore\u2014modernist \"style\"\u2014now becomes the marker and the substitute (the \"tenant-lieu,\" or place-holding, in Lacanian language) of the unrepresentable totality. With this a new kind of value emerges (and it is this which is generally loosely and misleadingly referred to as modernist aestheticism): for if \"infinity\" (and \"imperialism\") is bad or negative in Forster, its perception, as a bodily and poetic process, is no longer that, but rather a positive achievement and an enlargement of our sensorium: so that the beauty of the new figure seems oddly unrelated to the social and historical judgment which is its content\n\nWhat I have tried to suggest about this \"event\" on the border or limit of representation might also have been shown for the representation of inner or metropolitan space itself, for the national daily life which must remain its primary raw material.(13) Because in the imperial world system this last is now radically incomplete, it must by compensation be formed into a self-subsisting totality: something Forster uniquely attempts to achieve by way of his providential ideology, which transforms chance contacts, coincidence, the contingent and random encounters between isolated subjects, into a utopian glimpse of achieved community. This glimpse is both moral and aesthetic all at once, for it is the achievement of something like an aesthetic pattern of relationships that confirms it as a social reality, however ephemeral; and the coincidence of the social (grasped in moral terms) and the aesthetic is then what allows other related works (such as those of Virginia Woolf) to refocus it by way of operations which look more aestheticizing than Forster's. Here also the internal social totality will remain incomplete; but the internal social classes are nonetheless explicitly designated by their absence (thus, Leonard is carefully characterized as nonproletarian, as standing \"at the extreme edge of gentiIity. He was not in the abyss but he could see it, and at times people whom he knew had dropped in, and counted no more\") (45). This internal subsumption is sharply to be distinguished from the exclusion of an external or colonized people (whose absence is not even designated): the distinction would correspond roughly to that which obtains in Freud between repression (neurosis) and foreclusion (psychosis)\n\nThe hypothesis suggested here\u2014between the emergence of a properly modernist \"style\" and the representational dilemmas of the new imperial world system\u2014will be validated only by the kind of new work it enables: by some fresh (formal and structural) approach to the moderns able to formulate their historical specificity more adequately for us today than the descriptions we have inherited from their contemporaries. Yet there is also another way in which such a hypothesis might be \"verified,\" at least by way of an Einsteinian \"thought experiment\": this would be something like a principle of experimental variation or aesthetic falsifiability, in which this particular metropolitan or First World modernist laboratory experiment is tested against radically different environmental conditions. These are not, in this period, to be found in what will come to be called the Third World, or in the colonies: there the face of imperialism is brute force, naked power, open exploitation; but there are also the mapping of the imperialist world system remains structurally incomplete, for the colonial subject will be unable to register the peculiar transformations of First World or metropolitan life which accompany the imperial relationship. Nor will it, from the point of view of the colonized, be of any interest to register those new realities, which are the private concern of the masters, and which a colonized culture must simply refuse and repudiate. What we seek, therefore, is a kind of exceptional situation, one of overlap and coexistence between these two incommensurable realities which are those of the lord and of the bondsman altogether, those of the metropolis and of the colony simultaneously. Our experimental variation, then, would presuppose, were it possible in the first place, a national situation which reproduces the appearance of First World social reality and social relationships\u2014perhaps through the coincidence of its language with the imperial language\u2014but whose underlying structure is in fact much closer to that of the Third World or of colonized daily life. A modernism arising in these circumstances could then be inspected and interrogated for its formal and structural differences from the works produced within the metropolis and examined above. But at least one such peculiar space exists, in the historical contingency of our global system: it is Ireland, and the uniqueness of the Irish situation will now allow us, as it were experimentally, to verify our argument up to this point. For it allows us to make a deduction, as it were, a priori from our hypotheses, and then to compare that deduction with the historical realities of Irish culture. If the thesis is correct, then, we may expect to find, in some abstractly possible Irish modernism, a form which on the one hand unites Forster's sense of the providential yet seemingly accidental encounters of characters with Woolf's aesthetic closure, but which on the other hand projects those onto a radically different kind of space, a space no longer central, as in English life, but marked as marginal and ec-centric after the fashion of the colonized areas of the imperial system. That colonized space may then be expected to transform the modernist formal project radically, while still retaining a distant family likeness to its imperial variants. But this \"deduction\" finds immediate historical confirmation, for I have in fact been describing Ulysses\n\nBut in Ulysses space does not have to be made symbolic in order to achieve closure and meaning: its closure is objective, endowed by the colonial situation itself\u2014whence the nonpoetic, nonstylistic nature of Joyce's language. In Forster, the deeper reality of the encounter, the coincidence, the determinate meetings or the five-minute lag that prevents them from coming about, are played off against the metropolis, which \"one visualizes as a tract of quivering grey, intelligent without purpose, and excitable without love; as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled; as a heart that certainly beats, but with no pulsation of humanity\" (108). In Joyce, the encounter is at one with Dublin itself, whose compact size anachronistically permits the now archaic life of the older city-state. It is therefore unnecessary to generate an aesthetic form of closure distinct from the city, which in First World modernism must be imposed by the violence of form upon this last as compensation\n\nOne wants, indeed, to go even further than this and to assert that what has been seen as the linguistic dimension of modernism proper\u2014namely, \"style\" as such, as something like an absolute category of the modern canon\u2014is also absent in Joyce. The spatial poetry that has been detected in Forster has, for one thing, no equivalent in Ulysses. \"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" is thrust back into Stephen's consciousness, and marked as subjective. At the other end of the continuum, the great anamorphic spaces of the Nighttown chapter take place much too close to the eye, as it were, to be characterized in terms of images. A personal style, evolving toward the conventionally modern, can be detected in early Joyce, and may be identified by way of traces of Walter Pater's mannerisms: all that survives of that in Ulysses is the self-conscious placement of crucial adverbs. Otherwise, style, as a category of some absolute subject, here disappears, and Joyce's palpable linguistic games and experiments are rather to be seen as impersonal sentence combinations and variations beyond all point of view (\"Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty McDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle ... \" etc.): whence one's occasional sense that (as with revolutionary modes of production) Joyce leaps over the stage of the modern into full postmodernism. The pastiche of styles in the Oxen of the Sun not merely discredits the category of style as such, but presents an enumeration of English styles, of the styles of the imperial occupying armies\n\nEven the matter of coincidence indeed\u2014so crucial in Forster and Woolf\u2014takes on a different meaning in Joyce, where such intersections are everywhere, but have little of the dubious providentiality they project in our other works (a partial exception needs to be made here for the father-son thematics). Leonard catches sight of Margaret and Mr. Wilcox in Saint Paul's at a climactic moment; Stephen catches sight of Mr. Bloom in a more doubtful, but also more aesthetic moment; yet this last does not raise the same questions as the former. London (or the Manhattan of Manhattan Transfer) is an agglomeration (and metropolis) in which such encounters are sheer coincidence; Dublin is a classical city in which they are not merely normal but expected. This is to say that a concept of the urban is present in Ulysses which contains and motivates those very encounters and intersections crucial to the modern, but lends them a different resonance. But Dublin, as we have said, remains classical because it is also a colonial city: and this \"peculiarity\" of Joyce's narrative content now determines a certain number of other formal results. For one thing, encounters in Joyce are already (or perhaps I should say, still) linguistic: they are stories, gossip, they have already been assimilated into speech and storytelling while taking place, so that the demiurgic transformation of the modernist poet or writer\u2014the need to invent a new speech in order to render the freshly revealed, nonlinguistic contingencies of modern life\u2014is in Joyce short-circuited. Meanwhile, this essential linguisticality of Ulysses\u2014a book, as he said himself, about \"the last great talkers\"\u2014is itself a result of imperialism, which condemns Ireland to an older rhetorical past and to the survivals of oratory (in the absence of action), and which freezes Dublin into an underdeveloped village in which gossip and rumor still reign supreme. Meanwhile, history itself, which must elsewhere be imported and introduced by fiat, is here already part of the urban fabric: the occupying army is present; it is perfectly natural for us to encounter its soldiers, as it is to witness the viceregal procession; the spasmodic efforts at militancy\u2014such as the assassination of the Invincibles\u2014are still vivid in the collective memory, and the appearance of one of the survivors is a Proustian shock, no doubt, but perfectly plausible. It is normal for the British intelligentsia to visit this interesting cultural backwater; normal for the nationalist debates (very specifically including the one around the national language) to sputter on in pubs, bars, and meeting places; while the very fact of the pub itself, or public space in which you meet and talk, is itself a happy survival of an older urban life, which will have no equivalent in metropolitan literature, where meetings between disparate characters must be more artificially arranged, by means of receptions and summer houses\n\nEven the one section of Ulysses which resembles a rather different modernist approach toward space\u2014the Wandering Rocks, which is the direct inspiration of Dos Passos and his discontinuous literary crosscutting\u2014is the exception that proves the rule, since these palpable discontinuities are already mere appearance: we know already in fact that these disjoined characters are already connected, by acquaintanceship and history, and that a shift in perspective would at once cause the illusion of external chance and coincidence to vanish utterly away. The Odyssey parallel itself\u2014which may superficially as an aesthetic design and allusion resemble the painting in Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse\u2014must also be rethought in the context of imperialism. It is of course the great formal pretext, whose setting in place then allows Joyce to elaborate the contingencies of his individual chapters without any deeper motivation (the other levels of the parallels, the colors, the tropes, the organs of the body, rather resemble Freudian \"secondary elaboration\" than genuine symbolism): but what must be stressed is that it is not the meaning of the Odyssey which is exploited here, but rather its spatial properties. The Odyssey serves as a map: it is indeed, on Joyce's reading of it, the one classical narrative whose closure is that of the map of a whole complete and equally closed region of the globe, as though somehow the very episodes themselves merged back into space, and the reading of them came to be indistinguishable from map reading. None of the other classical parallels in modern literature has this peculiar spatial dimension (think, for example, of the various subjects of Greek tragedy); indeed, it is as though this Third World modernism slyly turned the imperial relationship inside out, appropriating the great imperial space of the Mediterranean in order to organize the space of the colonial city, and to turn its walks and paths into the closure of a form and of a grand cultural monument\n\nThe traces of imperialism can therefore be detected in Western modernism, and are indeed constitutive of it; but we must not look for them in the obvious places, in content or in representation. Save in the special case of Irish literature, and of Joyce, they will be detected spatially, as formal symptoms, within the structure of First World modernist texts themselves\n\n\nNOTES\n1.

It is, I take it, the position of Terry Eagleton's stimulating Exiles and Emigres (New York: Schocken, 1970) that all the most important modern writers of what we think of as the English canon are in fact social marginals of various kinds, when not outright foreigners. The analogy to be explored with Britain is of course the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was an extraordinarily rich terrain for a variety of the most important modernisms in all the arts (and in philosophy as well). Hugo von Hofmannsthal May here be taken as the nonethnic Austrian norm, from which these modernisms are the deviation: his \"Letter from Lord Chandos\" is a paradigmatic text about the discovery and subsequent repudiation of the \"modern.\"\n10.

My oldest thoughts on all this were stimulated into being by Gertrude Stein's remarkable \"What Is English Literature\" in Lectures in America (Boston: Beacon, 1985). As this book no longer seems widely read, I will not resist quoting a relevant extract: \"If you live a daily life and it is all yours, and you come to own everything outside your daily life besides and it is all yours, you naturally begin to explain. You naturally continue describing your daily life which is all yours, and you naturally begin to explain how you own everything besides. You naturally begin to explain that to yourself and you naturally begin to explain it to those living your daily life who own it with you, everything outside, and you naturally explain it in a kind of way to some of those whom you own\" (41)\n\n\nOther works cited in the text:\nPaul Baran, The Political Economy of Growth (New York: Monthly Review, 1957)\nJacques Berque, La D\u00e9possession du Monde (Paris: Seuil, 1964)", "http://genius.com/Fredric-jameson-modernism-and-imperialism-annotated"], "1163142": ["We Exalt Thee by\u00a0Petra", "We Exalt Thee Lyrics\n\nWe exalt Thee\nWe exalt Thee\nWe exalt Thee, O Lord", "http://genius.com/Petra-we-exalt-thee-lyrics"], "1961639": ["Oh Christmas Tree by\u00a0Mario\u00a0Lanza", "Oh Christmas Tree Lyrics\n\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!\nHow are thy leaves so verdant!\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nHow are thy leaves so verdant!\n\nNot only in the summertime\nBut even in winter is thy prime\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nHow are thy leaves so verdant!\n\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nMuch pleasure doth thou bring me!\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nMuch pleasure doth thou bring me!\n\nFor every year the Christmas tree\nBrings to us all both joy and glee\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nMuch pleasure doth thou bring me!\n\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nThy candles shine out brightly!\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nThy candles shine out brightly!\n\nEach bough doth hold its tiny light\nThat makes each toy to sparkle bright\nO Christmas tree, O Christmas tree\nThy candles shine out brightly!", "http://genius.com/Mario-lanza-oh-christmas-tree-lyrics"], "2091816": ["I need thee every hour by\u00a0Don\u00a0Moen", "I need thee every hour Lyrics\n\nI need thee every hour\nMost gracious Lord\nNo tender voice like thine\nCan peace afford\n\nI need thee, oh, I need thee\nEvery hour I need thee\nO bless me now, my Saviour\nI come to thee\n\nI need thee every hour\nIn joy or pain\nCome quickly and abide\nOr life is in vain\n\nI need thee, oh, I need thee\nEvery hour I need thee\nO bless me now, my Saviour\nI come to thee", "http://genius.com/Don-moen-i-need-thee-every-hour-lyrics"], "1631020": ["O Christmas Tree by\u00a0Tony\u00a0Bennett", "O Christmas Tree Lyrics\n\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nSuch pleasure do you bring me!\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nSuch pleasure do you bring me!\n\nEvery year this Christmas tree\nBrings to us both joy and glee\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nSuch pleasure do you bring me!\n\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nThy candles shine so brightly!\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nThy candles shine so brightly!\n\nEach bough does hold its tiny light\nThat makes each toy to sparkle bright\nOh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree\nThy candles shine so brightly!", "http://genius.com/Tony-bennett-o-christmas-tree-lyrics"], "503469": ["The Hermetic Museum Vol. 1: The Golden Age Restored by\u00a0Arthur\u00a0Edward Waite", "The Hermetic Museum Vol. 1: The Golden Age Restored Lyrics\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE\n\nRESTORED:\n\nHAVING NOW APPEARED A SECOND TIME, FLOURISHED\nBEAUTIFULLY, AND BROUGHT FORTH FRAGRANT AND\nGOLDEN SEED.

Nor did I even then find the arcanum without constant and untiring application. I have, indeed, studied the writings, parables, and various figures of the philosophers with singular industry, and laboured hard to solve their manifold wonderful enigmas, most of which are simply the vain products of their imaginations. It was long before experience taught me that all their obscure verbiage and high pretensions are mere folly and empty phantasms (as is amply testified by our leading Sages). Then I understood that their preparations (of which we read in Geber, Albertus Magnus, and others), their purgations, sublimations, cementations, distillations, rectifications, circulations, putrefactions, conjunctions, solutions, coagulations, calcinations, incinerations, mortifications, revivifications, &c., as also their tripods, athanors (furnaces), reverberatory alembics, excrements of horses, ashes, sand, stills, pelican-violas, retorts, fixatories, &c., are mere plausible impostures and frauds. This must be apparent to any one who considers the truth of the matter. Nature, who, in her noble simplicity, delights in her own\n\np. 54\n\nproper substance, knows nothing of these futilities. Hence Theophrastus (Sec. Mag. de Phil. Lap.) rightly says of those who seek the substance of the Stone in wine, imperfect bodies, blood, bismuth, mercury, sulphur, wine, dung, orpiment, and in plants, as chelidonia, hyssop, ivy, &c., that they are full of lies and thievery\u2014deceiving the credulous, milking their purses dry, and, as to the rest, following their own foolish fancies, that are quite unable to realise the requirements of Nature. (Tell me now who will help me with the minerals of the earth, distillations of water, &c.?) Some of them take new wine and urine for the purpose of changing them into metals. To hear them talk, you might suppose all that is sold at the apothecaries to be good for metals. Thou foolish man, dost thou not perceive that none of these things have anything to do with them?\n\nYou might as well try to sever Nature, as endeavour to make metals out of blood. Make a man out of a horse, or a milch cow out of a mouse: this would be according to the same method of multiplication. Art cannot change or overstep the natural order of the universe. If a woman bring forth a male child, you cannot change him into a little girl. From this rule, which evidently obtains throughout Nature, any sane person may gather where, and how, we must look for, and find, our Blessed Matter. But let no one imagine, or suffer any quack to delude him into the belief, that he has all that he requires when the substance has been made known to him either by God, or by one of the initiated. Let him not suppose that the solution and purification are a very simple matter. He could fall into no more serious mistake. He has scarcely got beyond the most elementary stage of his task. Let me once more tell him that I spent five entire years, after discovering the true Matter of the Stone, in the search after the right method of manipulating it, until at length, in the sixth year, the key of power was entrusted to me by the secret revelation of the most High God. That same key the ancient Patriarchs, Prophets, and Sages have always kept secret. \"For if,\" says Monarcha, in a certain passage, \"they had described it in an universally intelligible manner, and placed it within the reach of every labourer and porter, it would have been a great theft, and no true mystery; moreover, many evils would arise from such a profanation of the arcanum, which would also\n\np. 55\n\nbe manifestly contrary to God's will.\" For these and other reasons (which I have stated in the Epilogue), lest I should seem to be hiding the talent committed to me by God, I have in this my \"Golden Age Come Back\" (as far as Nature and God allow) revealed the Great Mystery of the Sages, which, through the grace of God, I have seen with these eyes, and handled with these hands. The just and pious reader will regard my undertaking with a kindly eye, and not suffer seeming contradictions to mislead him: the theory of and practice of this Art, and the laws which obtain in the Republic of the Chemists, forbade me to write more openly or plainly. I hope and trust that, nevertheless, all who look upon this book with the eyes of the mind, pore over it by day and by night, and pray to God from the bottom of their hearts, will, together with me, enjoy the wonderful hidden fruits of philosophy. In this way the Brethren of the true Golden Cross, and the elect members of the philosophic communion, are and remain joined together in a great confederation.\n\nIn conclusion, that the learned and worthy Christian reader may know my Christian name and my surname, I will remove every cause of complaint by making it known in the following manner. Let all and sundry be certified that the number of my name is 1613: by this number my whole name is written in the book of Nature with two dead ones, and seven living ones. After that, the letter 5 is the fifth part of B, and 15 the fifth part of 12. With this information you must be satisfied. Written at Tannenberg, March 23rd, 1622.\n\n____________\n\nEpigram to the Sons of Wisdom and the Doctrine.\n\nI have sought; I have found; I have often purified; and I have joined together; I have matured it: Then the golden tincture has followed, which is called the Centre of Nature (hence so many opinions, so many books, so many parables). It is the Remedy, I openly declare it, for all metals, and for all sick persons. The solution is of God.\n\nHERMAN DATICHIUS,\nThe Author's Famulus.\n\np. 56 p. 57\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE RESTORED.\n\nAS I pondered in my mind the marvels of the Most High, and the duty of fervent love to our neighbours, which He laid upon us; I remembered the wheat harvest, when Reuben, the son of Leah, found Dudaim in the field, which Leah gave to Rachel for the love of the Patriarch Jacob. Then I was carried forward, being plunged in profound thought, to the time of Moses, who rendered potable the golden calf (which Aaron had formed) by reducing it to powder in the fire, throwing it into the water, and giving it the children of Israel to drink; and I marvelled greatly at the wonderful and masterly destruction of the metal by the man of God. But when I reflected upon the matter, the truth was borne in upon my mind, and my eyes were opened like those of the disciples at Emmaus, who knew their Master in the breaking of bread; and my heart burned within me. Then I retired to rest, that I might consider the matter further (on the morrow), and fell into a deep slumber; when, behold, Solomon appeared to me in all his power, wealth, and glory, and with him came his whole harem: sixty were queens, eight hundred concubines, and of virgins there was a countless number. One of them was his most beautiful dove, and was dearest to his heart. They formed a procession according to the Catholic rite, in the centre of which was one greatly praised and beloved, whose name was like ointment poured out, and whose fragrance was sweeter than that of spices; the fiery spirit of this person was the Key for the opening of the Temple, for entering the Holy of Holies, and taking hold on the horns of the Altar.\n\nWhen the procession had been performed in the manner aforesaid, Solomon shewed me the One Centre in the Triangle\n\np. 58\n\nof the Centre, and opened my understanding. Then I observed that a woman stood behind me, who had bared her breast, from a deep wound in which blood and water gushed forth. Her thighs were like two half-moons, made by the Master; her navel was like a round goblet; her belly like a heap of wheat, set about with roses; her breasts like two young roes that are twins; her neck like a tower of ivory; her eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the Gate of Bathrabbim; her nose like the Tower of Lebanon, which looketh towards Damascus; her head like Carmel, and the hair of her head like royal purple. Her garments, which were rancid, ill-savoured, and full of venom, lay at her feet, whither she had cast them; and at length she broke forth into these words: \"I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; they took away my veil from me.\" Thereupon I fell to the ground with great and ignorant terror. But Solomon bade me rise, and said: \"Fear not; for you see Nature bared, and the most secret of all secrets that is found beneath the sky and earth: She is beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners\u2014and nevertheless the pure and chaste virgin of whom Adam was formed and created. The entrance of her tabernacle is sealed. She lives in gardens, sleeps in the double cave of Abraham, in the field of Hebron, and her palace is in the depths of the Red Sea, and in transparent caverns. The air bare her, the fire nourished her: therefore she is the Queen of the earth, and has honey and milk in her breasts; her lips are as a dropping honeycomb; honey and milk are under her tongue; and the smell of her garments is to the wise like the smell of Lebanon\u2014but to the ignorant an abomination.\" And Solomon said further: \"Awake, and see my whole harem, and say what it is like.\" And straightway his whole harem was stripped naked. Yet could I not find or judge, and my eyes were sealed lest I should know the secret. When Solomon saw my infirmity, he set that naked woman apart from the rest of the harem, and said: \"Thy thoughts are vain, and thy mind is sunburnt; thy memory is shrouded in a thick mist, so that thou canst judge nothing\n\np. 59\n\nrightly. But if thou art on the watch, and makest good use of thy present opportunity, the bloody sweat and snowy tears of this virgin will have power to restore thee, and to strengthen and clarify thy intellect and memory that thy eyes may see the secret wonders of the Most High, the height of the things above, the depth of the things beneath, and that thou mayst clearly understand the powers and operation of all Nature, and of the elements. Thy intellect shall be silver, and thy memory golden. The colour of all precious stones shall appear before thy eyes; thou shalt know their birth, and separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats. Thy life shall be peace, but the bells of Aaron shall rouse thee from sleep, and the lyre of David, my father, from drowsiness.\" These words of Solomon awed and terrified me still more; in part I was adread at such emphatic speech, and in part also at the splendour and glory of the King's harem. But King Solomon seized my right hand, and led me through a wine cellar into a most splendid secret palace, where he refreshed me with flowers and apples. The windows were of transparent crystal, and I gazed through them. And he said: \"What do you see?\" I said: \"I see the former chamber whence we came, and on the left stands thy royal harem, and on the right naked virgins. Their eyes are redder than wine, and their teeth whiter than milk. But the garments that lie at their feet are fouler, blacker, and more unsightly than the river Kidron.\" \"Choose out one of these,\" said Solomon, \"to be your love. I esteem the virgins even as my own harem. And the more their loveliness delights me, the less am I deterred by their foul garments.\" With this, the King turned himself and spoke most kindly to one of his queens. There was in the chamber a mistress of about a hundred years of age. She was arrayed in a grey robe, and had a black fillet on her head, that was embroidered with many brilliant jewels, and lined within with red, yellow, and blue silk; her mantle was heavily ornamented with all kinds of Turkish and Indian colours and figures. This ancient woman nodded to me, and swore piously that she was the mother of that naked virgin, and that she was a pure, chaste, and sealed virgin, who had never before suffered the eye of man to dwell upon her, nor had any one ever touched her. She was the virgin of whom the\n\np. 60\n\n[paragraph continues] Prophet had spoken: \"Behold, we have a secret son, who with others has been changed. Behold, a virgin has conceived, the virgin that is called Apdorossa, that is, the sealed one, who suffers not others.\" Because her daughter was still unmarried, she had concealed her dowry beneath her feet, lest in the present war she should be deprived of her wealth by soldiers. But I was not to be deterred by her foul garments, but to choose her daughter from among all the rest for my beloved one, and the pleasure of my life. If I did so she would give me a lye with which I could cleanse her garments. Moreover, with her hand I should receive the flowing salt, the incombustible oil, and an inestimable treasure. She was about to declare this to me more in detail, when Solomon turned round, looked askance at me, and said: \"I am the wisest of men, and my pleasant harem and the glory and the beauty of my queens excel the gold of Ophir. The ornaments of my concubines shame the rays of the sun, and the beauty of my virgins the light of the moon. My virgins are heavenly, my wisdom inscrutable, my mind past finding out.\"\n\nThen I answered, while I bowed down to the ground with awe: \"Behold, if I have found grace in your eyes\u2014for I am lowly\u2014give me that naked virgin whom I have chosen from among all, to preserve my life. Her garments are old, defiled, and foul, but I will purge them, and love her with all my heart. Let her be my sister, my spouse, since one glance of her eyes has stolen away my heart, and I am sick with love for her.\" On hearing this Solomon straightway gave her to me. With that there arose a tumult in the harem, which roused me from my sleep. Now I knew not what had happened to me; but I took it for some dream, and thereupon until the light dawned I was full of subtle thoughts. But when I had risen, and poured forth my prayers, behold, I saw the garments of the naked virgin lying by my bedside, and when I saw not her, my hair stood on end, and I was covered with a cold perspiration. But I took heart and recalled my dream, and endeavoured to remember whether it had been real or not. But seeing that my pondering could explain nothing, I would by no means look again upon the garments, much less did I dare to touch them. So I changed my chamber, and, out of sheer ignorance, left those garments\n\np. 61\n\nlying there a long time. For I feared that if I touched them or turned them over, something remarkable would happen to me. Now the poisonous odour of the garments which I had inhaled in my sleep was so sickening that my eyes could not see the time of grace, or my heart understand the great wisdom of Solomon.\n\nAfter the garments had lain five years in the chamber, I at length determined to throw them into the fire, and change my dwelling. In the night after I had formed this resolution, that ancient woman appeared to me in a dream, and rebuked with the following angry words: \"Most ungrateful of mortals, the garments of my daughter, beneath which lie concealed those priceless jewels, have now been committed to thee for more than five years. Yet in all that time thou hast not cleansed or purified them, and now thou thinkest to burn them; is it not enough that thou art the cause of my daughter's death?\" Then I answered, wrathfully: \"How am I to understand thy words? Wouldst thou make me out to be a robber, though during those five years I have never seen thy daughter, or heard a syllable about her? How can I possibly be the cause of her death?\" Here she took me up: \"All this is true. Nevertheless thou hast sinned grievously against God, and on that account hast not received from me my daughter, or the lye of the Sages wherewith to cleanse her garments. For since thou wert from the very first horrified at the sight of my daughter's garments, the planet Saturn, her grandfather, was wroth, and changed her into what she was before her birth. Moreover, thou hast offended him by despising her, and being the cause of her death, corruption, and final destruction. She it is of whom Senior thus speaks: 'Woe, woe unto me! Bring me a naked woman, while my body was yet invisible, and I had not yet become a mother, till I should be born a second time; then I brought forth all the strength of the vegetable roots, and carried off the victory in my essence.'\" These words sounded strange and mysterious to me, yet I manfully repressed my wrath, and solemnly protested that I knew nothing of her daughter's decease, and certainly had not been the cause of her death, corruption, and destruction; that I had kept her garments five years in my chamber, but had been\n\np. 62\n\nprevented by my great blindness from understanding their use; and that I felt innocent before God and men. My excuse satisfied the ancient woman; she looked kindly at me, and said: \"I see that thy conscience is pure from guilt, and for thy innocence thou shalt receive a great reward. Therefore, I will reveal to thee this matter faithfully, but secretly. My daughter, for the great love she bare thee, has left thee under her garments a grey box wrapped in a thick, black, mouldy cloth.\" With this she gave me a glass bottle full of lye, and continued: \"Purge that box well of the dirt and bad smell with which the garments have infected it, and then thou shalt want no key, but the box will open of its own accord, and in it thou shalt find two things, viz., a white silver casket full of polished diamonds, and a rich robe intertissued with precious solar jasper stones. All these treasures belonged to my dear daughter, and she left them all to thee before she was transformed and perished. If thou wilt skilfully transpose this treasure, carefully purify it, and silently and patiently place it in some warm, moist, vaporous, and transparent chamber, and guard it there from cold, wind, hail, swift lightning, and all outward injury, till the season of the wheat harvest, thou shalt perceive and behold the great glory and beauty of thine heritage.\"\n\nWhen she had thus spoken, I awoke, and devoutly prayed that God might grant me wisdom to find the box which had been described to me in my dream. Then I instituted a careful search among the garments, and was soon rewarded with success; but the cloth in which the box was wrapped was so hard and so firmly glued to it that I could not tear it off; moreover, I could not cleanse it with lye, or cut it with iron, steel, or any other metal. So I did not know what in all the world I should do, and began to think that it was a poisoned cloth, and to call to mind the saying of the Prophet: \"Though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the Lord God.\"\n\nSo another year passed away, and still all my patient toil and thought had met with no success. At last, to drive away melancholy, I took a walk in a certain garden; and, after some time, I sat down upon a stone and fell into a deep sleep. I slept, but my heart waked. Then the ancient woman appeared to me once more, and said: \"Have you entered upon the heritage of my\n\np. 63\n\ndaughter?\" I sorrowfully replied, \"I did indeed find the box, but I cannot remove the cloth, nor will the lye that thou gayest me avail to soften it.\" Then she laughed at my simplicity, and said: \"Dost thou try to eat oysters or crabs in their shells? Must they not first be prepared by the ancient cook of the planets? I told thee to purify the grey box with the lye I gave thee, but not the cloth which is wrapped round it. The latter thou shouldest first have burned with the fire of the Sages.\" For this purpose she gave me some glowing coals, wrapped in a silk cloth, from which I was to obtain the subtle fire of the Sages, and told me that if with this fire I burned away the cloth I should get at the box. When she had ended, straightway there arose a north and south wind, and blew through the garden. Then I awoke again, shook off sleep, and beheld the glowing coals lying at my feet. I took them up with a grateful heart, and began to work day and night, remembering the saying of the Sages: \"Fire and Azoth are sufficient for thee\"; and the passage in Esdras (Bk. iv.): \"And he gave me a goblet filled with fire, and when I had drunk it wisdom grew in me; and God granted me understanding, and my spirit was preserved, and my mouth opened, but nothing else was added.\" After forty nights I had finished 204 books, of which seventy were worthy to be read by the most wise, and were written upon box tablets. I thus continued in silence and hope, as that ancient woman had bidden me do, until at last, after a long time, my understanding, in fulfilment of Solomon's prophecy, became silver, and my memory gold.\n\nWhen, in obedience to the directions of the ancient lady, I had skilfully placed the treasure of her daughter in a chamber by itself, and closed it up, I gazed upon those brilliant lunar diamonds, and solar rubies, and understood the meaning of Solomon when he says: \"My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven; his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set; his cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers; his lips like roses dropping fragrant myrrh; his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl; his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires; his legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold; his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the\n\np. 64\n\ncedars; his mouth is most sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem. Hold him, and suffer him not to go, till I have brought him into my mother's house, into my mother's chamber.\"\n\nTo these words of Solomon I could find no answer, and had already determined to take the treasure out of the chamber that I might at length enjoy quietness and peace, when I happened upon this other passage: \"I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please. She is a garden enclosed; a spring shut up; a fountain sealed; a vineyard at Baal-hamon; a vineyard at Engedi; an orchard; a spice garden; a hill of myrrh; a mountain of incense; a bed; a crown; a palm tree; a rose of Sharon; a sapphire; a beryl stone; a wall; a tower, and battlement; a garden of herbs; a fountain in a garden; a spring of living waters; a daughter of princes, and the pleasant love of Solomon; she dearly loves her mother, and is her mother's chosen one; her head is full of dew, and her locks wet with the drops of night.\"\n\nThese words enlightened me, and shewed unto me the aim of the wise: wherefore I patiently left the treasure in the chamber, and waited till through God's mercy all should have been happily perfected by the operation of Nature, and the labour of my hands.\n\nShortly afterwards, on the day Of the new moon, an eclipse of the sun was seen, which was terrible to behold, for it began with a misty greenness, somewhat shot over with other colours, but it was followed by entire blackness; all heaven and earth were shrouded in thick darkness, and men were full of fear, but I rejoiced. For I remembered God's great mercy, and the Mystery of Regeneration, as Christ Himself told us that unless a grain of wheat was cast into the earth, and decomposed, it could bring forth no fruit. Now it happened that the eclipse was covered by clouds, and the sun began to shine, but as yet three-fourths of it were darkened. And, behold, an arm held out from the clouds a letter sealed at the four corners, on which was written: \"I am black, but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the\n\np. 65\n\ncurtains of Solomon. Look not upon me, because I am black, and burnt by the sun.\" Then there was seen a rainbow, and I remembered the Covenant of the Most High, and the faithfulness of my Teacher, and, behold, by the help of the planets and the fixed stars, the sun at last overcame the eclipse, and shone out once more in perfect brightness upon the mountains and valleys. Then all fear and terror were at an end, and all that had seen that day rejoiced in the Lord, and said: \"Lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, that we may gather the ripe grapes and drink wine, and be satisfied in due season with milk and the honeycomb.\" At the approach of evening the sky changed its aspect, and the Seven Stars rose with a lurid light, till, having completed their natural course, they paled and vanished before the Redness of the Sun. And, behold, the wise that dwelt upon earth awoke from their sleep, and gazed up to heaven, and said: \"Who is it that bursts forth like the Dawn, beautiful like the Moon, mighty like the Sun, in whom there appears no spot? his fervour is kindled, and the flame of the Lord: Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. Therefore, we will not forsake her; she is our sister, though she be small, and have no breasts. We will take her back to the house of her mother, into the transparent palace where she was before, that by sucking the breasts of her mother, she may become great like the tower of David, strengthened with battlements, on which hang a thousand shields and all the weapons of the strong. When she went forth the daughters called her blessed, the Queen and the concubines praised her.\" But I knelt down, and returned thanks to God, and glorified His Holy Name.\n\n_______________________\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\nAnd now, my beloved Sons of Wisdom and the Doctrine, herein is the great Mystery of the Sages, in all the power and glory thereof, and the Revelation of the Spirit, concerning\n\np. 66\n\n[paragraph continues] Whom the prince and monarch Theophrastus has these words, in his Apocalypse of Hermes: \"He is the only God, and holds the whole world together; through Him alone can we be true, and truly vanquish the Elements, and, obtain the Quintessence. No eye has seen, no ear has heard, neither has it entered into the heart of any man to conceive that which is in thy. mind of this Spirit of Truth. In Him alone is truth, and through Him alone Adam and the other patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were enabled to secure constant health, and a long life, and to provide for themselves great wealth. Through this Spirit the Seven Sages invented the Arts, and gained riches. With His aid Noah built the Ark, Solomon the Temple, and Moses the Tabernacle; through Him vessels of pure gold were borne into the Temple; through Him Solomon gained his excellent knowledge, and performed mighty deeds. He enabled Ezra to restore the Law; Miriam, sister of Moses, to exercise liberality; and the Prophets of the Old Covenant to predict the future. He is the Sanctification and Healing of all things, the highest knowledge, the ultimate Mystery of Nature, that is to say, the Spirit of the Lord, Who fills the whole universe, and Who brooded over the waters in the beginning\u2014without Whose secret teaching the world cannot be understood, and Whom the whole world desires on account of His power, while the Saints have sought and longed ardently to see Him from the beginning of the world. For He dwells in the seven Planets, raises the clouds, dispels the mist, gives light to all things, changes everything into gold and silver, imparts all health, abundance, and treasure, heals the leper,, cures dropsy and gout, prolongs life, comforts the sorrowful, restores health to the sick, removes all defects, and, in short, is the Mystery of all mysteries, the Arcanum of all arcana, the true healing and Medicine of all things. He gives the desired knowledge, and is the best of all sublunar things, by which Nature is strengthened, and the heart with all the members renewed, the flower of youth kept fresh, old age driven away, diseases destroyed, and the whole earth renewed. His Nature is unsearchable, His power infinite, His excellence and glory unapproachable.\n\n\"Moreover, this Spirit presides over all heavenly things, gives health, fortune, joy, peace, love, destroys every evil after\n\np. 67\n\nits kind, puts an end to poverty and misery, renders men incapable of doing, saying, or thinking any evil, and gives to the godly temporal felicity, but to the wicked who abuse it, eternal punishment.\"\n\nAnd thus, in the Name of the Holy Trinity, we will, in these few words, conclude our exposition of the Great Mystery of the Most Precious Philosophical Stone, and of the Arcanum of the Sages. To the Most High and Almighty God, the Creator of this Art, Whom it hath pleased to reveal to me, wretched, sinful man (in answer to my prayer), this most precious knowledge, be eternal praise, glory, honour, and thanksgiving; and to Him be addressed a most humble and fervent prayer that He may so direct my heart and mind, that I may not speak of this Mystery, or make it known to the wicked, lest I be found unmindful of my Vow, a Breaker of the Heavenly Seal, a perjured Brother of the Golden Cross, and guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost. From this may God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, the Blessed and Indivisible Trinity, in mercy PRESERVE ME.

Yet would any contradict us, if we made them applicable to the other side, and began also,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frailty, thy name is MAN.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Earth waits for its King?\n\nYet Man, if not yet fully installed in his powers, has given much earnest of his claims. Frail he is indeed,\u2014how frail! how impure! Yet often has the vein of gold displayed itself amid the baser ores, and Man has appeared before us in princely promise worthy of his future.\n\nIf, oftentimes, we see the prodigal son feeding on the husks in the fair field no more his own, anon we raise the eyelids, heavy from bitter tears, to behold in him the radiant apparition of genius and love, demanding not less than the all of goodness, power and beauty. We see that in him the largest claim finds a due foundation. That claim is for no partial sway, no exclusive possession. He cannot be satisfied with any one gift of life, any one department of knowledge or telescopic peep at the heavens. He feels himself called to understand and aid Nature, that she may, through his intelligence, be raised and interpreted; to be a student of, and servant to, the universe-spirit; and king of his planet, that, as an angelic minister he may bring it into conscious harmony with the law of that spirit.\n\nIn clear, triumphant moments, many times, has rung through the spheres the prophecy of his jubilee; and those moments, though past in time, have been translated into eternity by thought; the bright signs they left hang in the heavens, as single stars or constellations, and, already, a thickly sown radiance consoles the wanderer in the darkest night. Other heroes since Hercules have fulfilled the zodiac of beneficent labors, and then given up their mortal part to the fire without a murmur; while no God dared deny that they should have their reward,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Siquis tamen, Hercule, siquis\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forte Deo doliturus erit, daia praemia nollet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sed meruise dari sciet, invitus que probabit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assensere Dei\n\nSages and lawgivers have bent their whole nature to the search for truth, and thought themselves happy if they could buy, with the sacrifice of all temporal ease and pleasure, one seed for the future Eden. Poets and priests have strung the lyre with the heart-strings, poured out their best blood upon the altar, which, reared anew from age to age, shall at last sustain the flame pure enough to rise to highest heaven. Shall we not name with as deep a benediction those who, if not so immediately, or so consciously, in connection with the eternal truth, yet, led and fashioned by a divine instinct, serve no less to develop and interpret the open secret of love passing into life, energy creating for the purpose of happiness; the artist whose hand, drawn by a preexistent harmony to a certain medium, moulds it to forms of life more highly and completely organized than are seen elsewhere, and, by carrying out the intention of nature, reveals her meaning to those who are not yet wise enough to divine it; the philosopher who listens steadily for laws and causes, and from those obvious infers those yet unknown; the historian who, in faith that all events must have their reason and their aim, records them, and thus fills archives from which the youth of prophets may be fed; the man of science dissecting the statements, testing the facts and demonstrating order, even where he cannot its purpose?\n\nLives, too, which bear none of these names, have yielded tones of no less significance. The candlestick set in a low place has given light as faithfully, where it was needed, as that upon the hill, In close alleys, in dismal nooks, the Word has been read as distinctly, as when shown by angels to holy men in the dark prison. Those who till a spot of earth scarcely larger than is wanted for a grave, have deserved that the sun should shine upon its sod till violets answer.\n\nSo great has been, from time to time, the promise, that, in all ages, men have said the gods themselves came down to dwell with them; that the All-Creating wandered on the earth to taste, in a limited nature, the sweetness of virtue; that the All-Sustaining incarnated himself to guard, in space and time, the destinies of this world; that heavenly genius dwelt among the shepherds, to sing to them and teach them how to sing. Indeed,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDer stets den Hirten gnadig sich bewies.\u201d\n\u201cHe has constantly shown himself favorable to shepherds.\u201d\n\nAnd the dwellers in green pastures and natural students of the stars were selected to hail, first among men, the holy child, whose life and death were to present the type of excellence, which has sustained the heart of so large a portion of mankind in these later generations.\n\nSuch marks have been made by the footsteps of man (still, alas! to be spoken of as the ideal man), wherever he has passed through the wilderness of men, and whenever the pigmies stepped in one of those, they felt dilate within the breast somewhat that promised nobler stature and purer blood. They were impelled to forsake their evil ways of decrepit scepticism and covetousness of corruptible possessions. Convictions flowed in upon them. They, too, raised the cry: God is living, now, to-day; and all beings are brothers, for they are his children. Simple words enough, yet which only angelic natures can use or hear in their full, free sense.\n\nThese were the triumphant moments; but soon the lower nature took its turn, and the era of a truly human life was postponed.\n\nThus is man still a stranger to his inheritance, still a pleader, still a pilgrim. Yet his happiness is secure in the end. And now, no more a glimmering consciousness, but assurance begins to be felt and spoken, that the highest ideal Man can form of his own powers is that which he is destined to attain. Whatever the soul knows how to seek, it cannot fail to obtain. This is the Law and the Prophets. Knock and it shall be opened; seek and ye shall find. It is demonstrated; it is a maxim. Man no longer paints his proper nature in some form, and says, \u201cPrometheus had it; it is God-like;\u201d but \u201cMan must have it; it is human.\u201d However disputed by many, however ignorantly used, or falsified by those who do receive it, the fact of an universal, unceasing revelation has been too clearly stated in words to be lost sight of in thought; and sermons preached from the text, \u201cBe ye perfect,\u201d are the only sermons of a pervasive and deep-searching influence.\n\nBut, among those who meditate upon this text, there is a great difference of view as to the way in which perfection shall be sought.\n\n\u201cThrough the intellect,\u201d say some. \u201cGather from every growth of life its seed of thought; look behind every symbol for its law; if thou canst see clearly, the rest will follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the life,\u201d say others. \u201cDo the best thou knowest today. Shrink not from frequent error in this gradual, fragmentary state. Follow thy light for as much as it will show thee; be faithful as far as thou canst, in hope that faith presently will lead to sight. Help others, without blaming their need of thy help. Love much, and be forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs not intellect, needs not experience,\u201d says a third. \u201cIf you took the true way, your destiny would be accomplished, in a purer and more natural order. You would not learn through facts of thought or action, but express through them the certainties of wisdom. In quietness yield thy soul to the causal soul. Do not disturb thy apprenticeship by premature effort; neither check the tide of instruction by methods of thy own. Be still; seek not, but wait in obedience. Thy commission will be given.\u201d\n\nCould we indeed say what we want, could we give a description of the child that is lost, he would be found. As soon as the soul can affirm clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at hand. When the Jewish prophet described the Lamb, as the expression of what was required by the coming era, the time drew nigh. But we say not, see not as yet, clearly, what we would. Those who call for a more triumphant expression of love, a love that cannot be crucified, show not a perfect sense of what has already been given. Love has already been expressed, that made all things new, that gave the worm its place and ministry as well as the eagle; a love to which it was alike to descend into the depths of hell, or to sit at the right hand of the Father.\n\nYet, no doubt, a new manifestation is at hand, a new hour in the day of Man. We cannot expect to see any one sample of completed being, when the mass of men still lie engaged in the sod, or use the freedom of their limbs only with wolfish energy. The tree cannot come to flower till its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole growth open to air and light. While any one is base, none can be entirely free and noble. Yet something new shall presently be shown of the life of man, for hearts crave, if minds do not know how to ask it.\n\nAmong the strains of prophecy, the following, by an earnest mind of a foreign land, written some thirty years ago, is not yet outgrown; and it has the merit of being a positive appeal from the heart, instead of a critical declaration what Man should not do.\n\n\u201cThe ministry of Man implies that he must be filled from the divine fountains which are being engendered through all eternity, so that, at the mere name of his master, he may be able to cast all his enemies into the abyss; that he may deliver all parts of nature from the barriers that imprison them; that he may purge the terrestrial atmosphere from the poisons that infect it; that he may preserve the bodies of men from the corrupt influences that surround, and the maladies that afflict them; still more, that he may keep their souls pure from the malignant insinuations which pollute, and the gloomy images that obscure them; that he may restore its serenity to the Word, which false words of men fill with mourning and sadness; that he may satisfy the desires of the angels, who await from him the development of the marvels of nature; that, in fine, his world may be filled with God, as eternity is.\u201d [Footnote: St. Martin]\n\nAnother attempt we will give, by an obscure observer of our own day and country, to draw some lines of the desired image. It was suggested by seeing the design of Crawford's Orpheus, and connecting with the circumstance of the American, in his garret at Rome, making choice of this subject, that of Americans here at home showing such ambition to represent the character, by calling their prose and verse \u201cOrphic sayings\u201d\u2014\u201dOrphics.\u201d We wish we could add that they have shown that musical apprehension of the progress of Nature through her ascending gradations which entitled them so to do, but their attempts are frigid, though sometimes grand; in their strain we are not warmed by the fire which fertilized the soil of Greece.\n\nOrpheus was a lawgiver by theocratic commission. He understood nature, and made her forms move to his music. He told her secrets in the form of hymns, Nature as seen in the mind of God. His soul went forth toward all beings, yet could remain sternly faithful to a chosen type of excellence. Seeking what he loved, he feared not death nor hell; neither could any shape of dread daunt his faith in the power of the celestial harmony that filled his soul.\n\nIt seemed significant of the state of things in this country, that the sculptor should have represented the seer at the moment when he was obliged with his hand to shade his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Orpheus must to the depths descend;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For only thus the Poet can be wise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must make the sad Persephone his friend,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And buried love to second life arise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again his love must lose through too much love,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must lose his life by living life too true,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For what he sought below is passed above,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already done is all that he would do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must tune all being with his single lyre,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must melt all rooks free from their primal pain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must search all nature with his one soul's fire,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If he already sees what he must do,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well may he shade his eyes from the far-shining view.\n\nA better comment could not be made on what is required to perfect Man, and place him in that superior position for which he was designed, than by the interpretation of Bacon upon the legends of the Syren coast \u201cWhen the wise Ulysses passed,\u201d says he, \u201che caused his mariners to stop their ears, with wax, knowing there was in them no power to resist the lure of that voluptuous song. But he, the much experienced man, who wished to be experienced in all, and use all to the service of wisdom, desired to hear the song that he might understand its meaning. Yet, distrusting his own power to be firm in his better purpose, he caused himself to be bound to the mast, that he might be kept secure against his own weakness. But Orpheus passed unfettered, so absorbed in singing hymns to the gods that he could not even hear those sounds of degrading enchantment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, not a few believe, and men themselves have expressed the opinion, that the time is come when Eurydice is to call for an Orpheus, rather than Orpheus for Eurydice; that the idea of Man, however imperfectly brought out, has been far more so than that of Woman; that she, the other half of the same thought, the other chamber of the heart of life, needs now take her turn in the full pulsation, and that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the reformation of the sons of this age.\n\nIt should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in behalf of Woman. As men become aware that few men have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance. The French Revolution, that strangely disguised angel, bore witness in favor of Woman, but interpreted her claims no less ignorantly than those of Man. Its idea of happiness did not rise beyond outward enjoyment, unobstructed by the tyranny of others. The title it gave was \u201ccitoyen,\u201d \u201ccitoyenne;\u201d and it is not unimportant to Woman that even this species of equality was awarded her. Before, she could be condemned to perish on the scaffold for treason, not as a citizen, but as a subject. The right with which this title then invested a human being was that of bloodshed and license. The Goddess of Liberty was impure. As we read the poem addressed to her, not long since, by Beranger, we can scarcely refrain from tears as painful as the tears of blood that flowed when \u201csuch crimes were committed in her name.\u201d Yes! Man, born to purify and animate the unintelligent and the cold, can, in his madness, degrade and pollute no less the fair and the chaste. Yet truth was prophesied in the ravings of that hideous fever, caused by long ignorance and abuse. Europe is conning a valued lesson from the blood-stained page. The same tendencies, further unfolded, will bear good fruit in this country.\n\nYet, by men in this country, as by the Jews, when Moses was leading them to the promised land, everything has been done that inherited depravity could do, to hinder the promise of Heaven from its fulfilment. The cross, here as elsewhere, has been planted only to be blasphemed by cruelty and fraud. The name of the Prince of Peace has been profaned by all kinds of injustice toward the Gentile whom he said he came to save. But I need not speak of what has been done towards the Red Man, the Black Man. Those deeds are the scoff of the world; and they have been accompanied by such pious words that the gentlest would not dare to intercede with \u201cFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u201d\n\nHere, as elsewhere, the gain of creation consists always in the growth of individual minds, which live and aspire, as flowers bloom and birds sing, in the midst of morasses; and in the continual development of that thought, the thought of human destiny, which is given to eternity adequately to express, and which ages of failure only seemingly impede. Only seemingly; and whatever seems to the contrary, this country is as surely destined to elucidate a great moral law, as Europe was to promote the mental culture of Man.\n\nThough the national independence be blurred by the servility of individuals; though freedom and equality have been proclaimed only to leave room for a monstrous display of slave-dealing and slave-keeping; though the free American so often feels himself free, like the Roman, only to pamper his appetites end his indolence through the misery of his fellow-beings; still it is not in vain that the verbal statement has been made, \u201cAll men are born free and equal.\u201d There it stands, a golden certainty wherewith to encourage the good, to shame the bad. The New World may be called clearly to perceive that it incurs the utmost penalty if it reject or oppress the sorrowful brother. And, if men are deaf, the angels hear. But men cannot be deaf. It is inevitable that an external freedom, an independence of the encroachments of other men, such as has been achieved for the nation, should be so also for every member of it. That which has once been clearly conceived in the intelligence cannot fail, sooner or later, to be acted out. It has become a law as irrevocable as that of the Medes in their ancient dominion; men will privately sin against it, but the law, as expressed by a leading mind of the age,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTutti fatti a semblanza d'un Solo,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figli tutti d'un solo riscatto,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In qual'ora, in qual parte del suolo\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trascorriamo quest' aura vital,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Siam fratelli, siam stretti ad un patto:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maladetto colui che lo infrange,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Che s'innalza sul finoco che piange\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Che contrista uno spirto immortal.\u201d [Footnote: Manzoni]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll made in the likeness of the One.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All children of one ransom,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In whatever hour, in whatever part of the soil,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We draw this vital air,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are brothers; we must be bound by one compact;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accursed he who infringes it,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who raises himself upon the weak who weep,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who saddens an immortal spirit.\u201d\n\nThis law cannot fail of universal recognition.

Accursed be he who sins in ignorance, if that ignorance be caused by sloth.\n\nWe sicken no less at the pomp than the strife of words. We feel that never were lungs so puffed with the wind of declamation, on moral and religious subjects, as now. We are tempted to implore these \u201cword-heroes,\u201d these word-Catos, word-Christs, to beware of can't [Footnote: Dr. Johnson's one piece of advice should be written on every door: \u201cClear your mind of can't.\u201d But Byron, to whom it was so acceptable, in clearing away the noxious vine, shook down the building. Sterling's emendation is worthy of honor:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRealize your can't, not cast it off.\u201d]\n\nabove all things; to remember that hypocrisy is the most hopeless as well as the meanest of crimes, and that those must surely be polluted by it, who do not reserve a part of their morality and religion for private use. Landor says that he cannot have a great deal of mind who cannot afford to let the larger part of it lie fallow; and what is true of genius is not less so of virtue. The tongue is a valuable member, but should appropriate but a small part of the vital juices that are needful all over the body. We feel that the mind may \u201cgrow black and rancid in the smoke\u201d even \u201cof altars.\u201d We start up from the harangue to go into our closet and shut the door. There inquires the spirit, \u201cIs this rhetoric the bloom of healthy blood, or a false pigment artfully laid on?\u201d And yet again we know where is so much smoke, must be some fire; with so much talk about virtue and freedom, must be mingled some desire for them; that it cannot be in vain that such have become the common topics of conversation among men, rather than schemes for tyranny and plunder, that the very newspapers see it best to proclaim themselves \u201cPilgrims,\u201d \u201cPuritans,\u201d \u201cHeralds of Holiness.\u201d The king that maintains so costly a retinue cannot be a mere boast, or Carabbas fiction. We have waited here long in the dust; we are tired and hungry; but the triumphal procession must appear at last.\n\nOf all its banners, none has been more steadily upheld, and under none have more valor and willingness for real sacrifices been shown, than that of the champions of the enslaved African. And this band it is, which, partly from a natural following out of principles, partly because many women have been prominent in that cause, makes, just now, the warmest appeal in behalf of Woman.\n\nThough there has been a growing liberality on this subject, yet society at large is not so prepared for the demands of this party, but that its members are, and will be for some time, coldly regarded as the Jacobins of their day.\n\n\u201cIs it not enough,\u201d cries the irritated trader, \u201cthat you have done all you could to break up the national union, and thus destroy the prosperity of our country, but now you must be trying to break up family union, to take my wife away from the cradle and the kitchen-hearth to vote at polls, and preach from a pulpit? Of course, if she does such things, she cannot attend to those of her own sphere. She is happy enough as she is. She has more leisure than I have,\u2014every means of improvement, every indulgence.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you asked her whether she was satisfied with these indulgences?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I know she is. She is too amiable to desire what would make me unhappy, and too judicious to wish to step beyond the sphere of her sex. I will never consent to have our peace disturbed by any such discussions.\u201d\n\n\u201c'Consent\u2014you?' it is not consent from you that is in question\u2014it is assent from your wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm not I the head of my house?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the head of your wife. God has given her a mind of her own.\n\n\u201cI am the head, and she the heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod grant you play true to one another, then! I suppose I am to be grateful that you did not say she was only the hand. If the head represses no natural pulse of the heart, there can be no question as to your giving your consent. Both will be of one accord, and there needs but to present any question to get a full and true answer. There is no need of precaution, of indulgence, nor consent. But our doubt is whether the heart does consent with the head, or only obeys its decrees with a passiveness that precludes the exercise of its natural powers, or a repugnance that turns sweet qualities to bitter, or a doubt that lays waste the fair occasions of life. It is to ascertain the truth that we propose some liberating measures.\u201d\n\nThus vaguely are these questions proposed and discussed at present. But their being proposed at all implies much thought, and suggests more. Many women are considering within themselves what they need that they have not, and what they can have if they find they need it. Many men are considering whether women are capable of being and having more than they are and have, and whether, if so, it will be best to consent to improvement in their condition.\n\nThis morning, I open the Boston \u201cDaily Mail,\u201d and find in its \u201cpoet's corner\u201d a translation of Schiller's \u201cDignity of Woman.\u201d In the advertisement of a book on America, I see in the table of contents this sequence, \u201cRepublican Institutions. American Slavery. American Ladies.\u201d\n\nI open the \u201cDeutsche Schnellpost\u201d published in New York, and find at the head of a column, Juden und Frauenemancipation in Ungarn\u2014\u201dEmancipation of Jews and Women in Hungary.\u201d\n\nThe past year has seen action in the Rhode Island legislature, to secure married women rights over their own property, where men showed that a very little examination of the subject could teach them much; an article in the Democratic Review on the same subject more largely considered, written by a woman, impelled, it is said, by glaring wrong to a distinguished friend, having shown the defects in the existing laws, and the state of opinion from which they spring; and on answer from the revered old man, J. Q. Adams, in some respects the Phocion of his time, to an address made him by some ladies. To this last I shall again advert in another place.\n\nThese symptoms of the times have come under my view quite accidentally: one who seeks, may, each month or week, collect more.\n\nThe numerous party, whose opinions are already labeled and adjusted too much to their mind to admit of any new light, strive, by lectures on some model-woman of bride-like beauty and gentleness, by writing and lending little treatises, intended to mark out with precision the limits of Woman's sphere, and Woman's mission, to prevent other than the rightful shepherd from climbing the wall, or the flock from using any chance to go astray.\n\nWithout enrolling ourselves at once on either side, let us look upon the subject from the best point of view which to-day offers; no better, it is to be feared, than a high house-top. A high hill-top, or at least a cathedral-spire, would be desirable.\n\nIt may well be an Anti-Slavery party that pleads for Woman, if we consider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with men; so that, if a husband dies without making a will, the wife, instead of taking at once his place as head of the family, inherits only a part of his fortune, often brought him by herself, as if she were a child, or ward only, not an equal partner.\n\nWe will not speak of the innumerable instances in which profligate and idle men live upon the earnings of industrious wives; or if the wives leave them, and take with them the children, to perform the double duty of mother and father, follow from place to place, and threaten to rob them of the children, if deprived of the rights of a husband, as they call them, planting themselves in their poor lodgings, frightening them into paying tribute by taking from them the children, running into debt at the expense of these otherwise so overtasked helots. Such instances count up by scores within my own memory. I have seen the husband who had stained himself by a long course of low vice, till his wife was wearied from her heroic forgiveness, by finding that his treachery made it useless, and that if she would provide bread for herself and her children, she must be separate from his ill fame\u2014I have known this man come to install himself in the chamber of a woman who loathed him, and say she should never take food without his company. I have known these men steal their children, whom they knew they had no means to maintain, take them into dissolute company, expose them to bodily danger, to frighten the poor woman, to whom, it seems, the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth, and nourished their infancy, does not give an equal right to them. I do believe that this mode of kidnapping\u2014and it is frequent enough in all classes of society\u2014will be by the next age viewed as it is by Heaven now, and that the man who avails himself of the shelter of men's laws to steal from a mother her own children, or arrogate any superior right in them, save that of superior virtue, will bear the stigma he deserves, in common with him who steals grown men from their mother-land, their hopes, and their homes.\n\nI said, we will not speak of this now; yet I have spoken, for the subject makes me feel too much. I could give instances that would startle the most vulgar and callous; but I will not, for the public opinion of their own sex is already against such men, and where cases of extreme tyranny are made known, there is private action in the wife's favor. But she ought not to need this, nor, I think, can she long. Men must soon see that as, on their own ground, Woman is the weaker party, she ought to have legal protection, which would make such oppression impossible. But I would not deal with \u201catrocious instances,\u201d except in the way of illustration, neither demand from men a partial redress in some one matter, but go to the root of the whole. If principles could be established, particulars would adjust themselves aright. Ascertain the true destiny of Woman; give her legitimate hopes, and a standard within herself; marriage and all other relations would by degrees be harmonized with these.\n\nBut to return to the historical progress of this matter. Knowing that there exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as toward slaves, such as is expressed in the common phrase, \u201cTell that to women and children;\u201d that the infinite soul can only work through them in already ascertained limits; that the gift of reason, Man's highest prerogative, is allotted to them in much lower degree; that they must be kept from mischief and melancholy by being constantly engaged in active labor, which is to be furnished and directed by those better able to think, &c., &c.,\u2014we need not multiply instances, for who can review the experience of last week without recalling words which imply, whether in jest or earnest, these views, or views like these,\u2014knowing this, can we wonder that many reformers think that measures are not likely to be taken in behalf of women, unless their wishes could be publicly represented by women?\n\n\u201cThat can never be necessary,\u201d cry the other side. \u201cAll men are privately influenced by women; each has his wife, sister, or female friends, and is too much biased by these relations to fail of representing their interests; and, if this is not enough, let them propose and enforce their wishes with the pen. The beauty of home would be destroyed, the delicacy of the sex be violated, the dignity of halls of legislation degraded, by an attempt to introduce them there. Such duties are inconsistent with those of a mother;\u201d and then we have ludicrous pictures of ladies in hysterics at the polls, and senate-chambers filled with cradles.\n\nBut if, in reply, we admit as truth that Woman seems destined by nature rather for the inner circle, we must add that the arrangements of civilized life have not been, as yet, such as to secure it to her. Her circle, if the duller, is not the quieter. If kept from \u201cexcitement,\u201d she is not from drudgery. Not only the Indian squaw carries the burdens of the camp, but the favorites of Louis XIV. accompany him in his journeys, and the washerwoman stands at her tub, and carries home her work at all seasons, and in all states of health. Those who think the physical circumstances of Woman would make a part in the affairs of national government unsuitable, are by no means those who think it impossible for negresses to endure field-work, even during pregnancy, or for sempstresses to go through their killing labors.\n\nAs to the use of the pen, there was quite as much opposition to Woman's possessing herself of that help to free agency as there is now to her seizing on the rostrum or the desk; and she is likely to draw, from a permission to plead her cause that way, opposite inferences to what might be wished by those who now grant it.\n\nAs to the possibility of her filling with grace and dignity any such position, we should think those who had seen the great actresses, and heard the Quaker preachers of modern times, would not doubt that Woman can express publicly the fulness of thought and creation, without losing any of the peculiar beauty of her sex. What can pollute and tarnish is to act thus from any motive except that something needs to be said or done. Woman could take part in the processions, the songs, the dances of old religion; no one fancied her delicacy was impaired by appearing in public for such a cause.\n\nAs to her home, she is not likely to leave it more than she now does for balls, theatres, meetings for promoting missions, revival meetings, and others to which she flies, in hope of an animation for her existence commensurate with what she sees enjoyed by men. Governors of ladies'-fairs are no less engrossed by such a charge, than the governor of a state by his; presidents of Washingtonian societies no less away from home than presidents of conventions. If men look straitly to it, they will find that, unless their lives are domestic, those of the women will not be. A house is no home unless it contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body. The female Greek, of our day, is as much in the street as the male to cry, \u201cWhat news?\u201d We doubt not it was the same in Athens of old. The women, shut out from the market-place, made up for it at the religious festivals. For human beings are not so constituted that they can live without expansion. If they do not get it in one way, they must in another, or perish.\n\nAs to men's representing women fairly at present, while we hear from men who owe to their wives not only all that is comfortable or graceful, but all that is wise, in the arrangement of their lives, the frequent remark, \u201cYou cannot reason with a woman,\u201d\u2014when from those of delicacy, nobleness, and poetic culture, falls the contemptuous phrase \u201cwomen and children,\u201d and that in no light sally of the hour, but in works intended to give a permanent statement of the best experiences,\u2014when not one man, in the million, shall I say? no, not in the hundred million, can rise above the belief that Woman was made for Man,\u2014when such traits as these are daily forced upon the attention, can we feel that Man will always do justice to the interests of Woman? Can we think that he takes a sufficiently discerning and religious view of her office and destiny ever to do her justice, except when prompted by sentiment,\u2014accidentally or transiently, that is, for the sentiment will vary according to the relations in which he is placed? The lover, the poet, the artist, are likely to view her nobly. The father and the philosopher have some chance of liberality; the man of the world, the legislator for expediency, none.\n\nUnder these circumstances, without attaching importance, in themselves, to the changes demanded by the champions of Woman, we hail them as signs of the times. We would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down. We would have every path laid open to Woman as freely as to Man. Were this done, and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to subside, we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various beauty. We believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a degree unknown in the history of former ages, and that no discordant collision, but a ravishing harmony of the spheres, would ensue.\n\nYet, then and only then will mankind be ripe for this, when inward and outward freedom for Woman as much as for Man shall be acknowledged as a right, not yielded as a concession. As the friend of the negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman. If the negro be a soul, if the woman be a soul, apparelled in flesh, to one Master only are they accountable. There is but one law for souls, and, if there is to be an interpreter of it, he must come not as man, or son of man, but as son of God.\n\nWere thought and feeling once so far elevated that Man should esteem himself the brother and friend, but nowise the lord and tutor, of Woman,\u2014were he really bound with her in equal worship,\u2014arrangements as to function and employment would be of no consequence. What Woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow, as an intellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home. If fewer talents were given her, yet if allowed the free and full employment of these, so that she may render back to the giver his own with usury, she will not complain; nay, I dare to say she will bless and rejoice in her earthly birth-place, her earthly lot. Let us consider what obstructions impede this good era, and what signs give reason to hope that it draws near.\n\nI was talking on this subject with Miranda, a woman, who, if any in the world could, might speak without heat and bitterness of the position of her sex. Her father was a man who cherished no sentimental reverence for Woman, but a firm belief in the equality of the sexes. She was his eldest child, and came to him at an age when he needed a companion. From the time she could speak and go alone, he addressed her not as a plaything, but as a living mind. Among the few verses he ever wrote was a copy addressed to this child, when the first locks were cut from her head; and the reverence expressed on this occasion for that cherished head, he never belied. It was to him the temple of immortal intellect. He respected his child, however, too much to be an indulgent parent. He called on her for clear judgment, for courage, for honor and fidelity; in short, for such virtues as he knew. In so far as he possessed the keys to the wonders of this universe, he allowed free use of them to her, and, by the incentive of a high expectation, he forbade, so far as possible, that she should let the privilege lie idle.\n\nThus this child was early led to feel herself a child of the spirit. She took her place easily, not only in the world of organized being, but in the world of mind. A dignified sense of self-dependence was given as all her portion, and she found it a sure anchor. Herself securely anchored, her relations with others were established with equal security. She was fortunate in a total absence of those charms which might have drawn to her bewildering flatteries, and in a strong electric nature, which repelled those who did not belong to her, and attracted those who did. With men and women her relations were noble,\u2014affectionate without passion, intellectual without coldness. The world was free to her, and she lived freely in it. Outward adversity came, and inward conflict; but that faith and self-respect had early been awakened which must always lead, at last, to an outward serenity and an inward peace.\n\nOf Miranda I had always thought as an example, that the restraints upon the sex were insuperable only to those who think them so, or who noisily strive to break them. She had taken a course of her own, and no man stood in her way. Many of her acts had been unusual, but excited no uproar. Few helped, but none checked her; and the many men who knew her mind and her life, showed to her confidence as to a brother, gentleness as to a sister. And not only refined, but very coarse men approved and aided one in whom they saw resolution and clearness of design. Her mind was often the leading one, always effective.\n\nWhen I talked with her upon these matters, and had said very much what I have written, she smilingly replied; \u201cAnd yet we must admit that I have been fortunate, and this should not be. My good father's early trust gave the first bias, and the rest followed, of course. It is true that I have had less outward aid, in after years, than most women; but that is of little consequence. Religion was early awakened in my soul,\u2014a sense that what the soul is capable to ask it must attain, and that, though I might be aided and instructed by others, I must depend on myself as the only constant friend. This self-dependence, which was honored in me, is deprecated as a fault in most women. They are taught to learn their rule from without, not to unfold it from within.\n\n\u201cThis is the fault of Man, who is still vain, and wishes to be more important to Woman than, by right, he should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen have not shown this disposition toward you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo; because the position I early was enabled to take was one of self-reliance. And were all women as sure of their wants as I was, the result would be the same. But they are so overloaded with precepts by guardians, who think that nothing is so much to be dreaded for a woman as originality of thought or character, that their minds are impeded by doubts till they lose their chance of fair, free proportions. The difficulty is to got them to the point from which they shall naturally develop self-respect, and learn self-help.\n\n\u201cOnce I thought that men would help to forward this state of things more than I do now. I saw so many of them wretched in the connections they had formed in weakness and vanity. They seemed so glad to esteem women whenever they could.\n\n\u201c'The soft arms of affection,' said one of the most discerning spirits, 'will not suffice for me, unless on them I see the steel bracelets of strength.'\n\n\u201cBut early I perceived that men never, in any extreme of despair, wished to be women. On the contrary, they were ever ready to taunt one another, at any sign of weakness, with,\n\n\u201c'Art thou not like the women, who,'\u2014\nThe passage ends various ways, according to the occasion and rhetoric of the speaker. When they admired any woman, they were inclined to speak of her as 'above her sex.' Silently I observed this, and feared it argued a rooted scepticism, which for ages had been fastening on the heart, and which only an age of miracles could eradicate. Ever I have been treated with great sincerity; and I look upon it as a signal instance of this, that an intimate friend of the other sex said, in a fervent moment, that I 'deserved in some star to be a man.' He was much surprised when I disclosed my view of my position and hopes, when I declared my faith that the feminine side, the side of love, of beauty, of holiness, was now to have its full chance, and that, if either were better, it was better now to be a woman; for even the slightest achievement of good was furthering an especial work of our time. He smiled incredulously. 'She makes the best she can of it,' thought he. 'Let Jews believe the pride of Jewry, but I am of the better sort, and know better.'\n\n\u201cAnother used as highest praise, in speaking of a character in literature, the words 'a manly woman.'\n\n\u201cSo in the noble passage of Ben Jonson:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I meant the day-star should not brighter ride,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor shed like influence, from its lucent seat;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free from that solemn vice of greatness, pride;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I meant each softest virtue there should meet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fit in that softer bosom to abide,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only a learned and a manly soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I purposed her, that should with even powers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rock, the spindle, and the shears control\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of destiny, and spin her own free hours.'\u201c\n\n\u201cMe thinks,\u201d said I, \u201cyou are too fastidious in objecting to this. Jonson, in using the word 'manly,' only meant to heighten the picture of this, the true, the intelligent fate, with one of the deeper colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said she, \u201cso invariable is the use of this word where a heroic quality is to be described, and I feel so sure that persistence and courage are the most womanly no less than the most manly qualities, that I would exchange these words for others of a larger sense, at the risk of marring the fine tissue of the verse. Read, 'A heavenward and instructed soul,' and I should be satisfied. Let it not be said, wherever there is energy or creative genius, 'She has a masculine mind.'\u201c\n\nThis by no means argues a willing want of generosity toward Woman. Man is as generous towards her as he knows how to be.\n\nWherever she has herself arisen in national or private history, and nobly shone forth in any form of excellence, men have received her, not only willingly, but with triumph. Their encomiums, indeed, are always, in some sense, mortifying; they show too much surprise. \u201cCan this be you?\u201d he cries to the transfigured Cinderella; \u201cwell, I should never have thought it, but I am very glad. We will tell every one that you have 'surpassed your sex.'\u201c\n\nIn every-day life, the feelings of the many are stained with vanity. Each wishes to be lord in a little world, to be superior at least over one; and he does not feel strong enough to retain a life-long ascendency over a strong nature. Only a Theseus could conquer before he wed the Amazonian queen. Hercules wished rather to rest with Dejanira, and received the poisoned robe as a fit guerdon. The tale should be interpreted to all those who seek repose with the weak.\n\nBut not only is Man vain and fond of power, but the same want of development, which thus affects him morally, prevents his intellectually discerning the destiny of Woman: The boy wants no woman, but only a girl to play ball with him, and mark his pocket handkerchief.\n\nThus, in Schiller's Dignity of Woman, beautiful as the poem is, there is no \u201cgrave and perfect man,\u201d but only a great boy to be softened and restrained by the influence of girls. Poets\u2014the elder brothers of their race\u2014have usually seen further; but what can you expect of every-day men, if Schiller was not more prophetic as to what women must be? Even with Richter, one foremost thought about a wife was that she would \u201ccook him something good.\u201d But as this is a delicate subject, and we are in constant danger of being accused of slighting what are called \u201cthe functions,\u201d let me say, in behalf of Miranda and myself, that we have high respect for those who \u201ccook something good,\u201d who create and preserve fair order in houses, and prepare therein the shining raiment for worthy inmates, worthy guests. Only these \u201cfunctions\u201d must not be a drudgery, or enforced necessity, but a part of life. Let Ulysses drive the beeves home, while Penelope there piles up the fragrant loaves; they are both well employed if these be done in thought and love, willingly. But Penelope is no more meant for a baker or weaver solely, than Ulysses for a cattle-herd.\n\nThe sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate, but prophesy to one another. In individual instances this happens. Two persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold. This is imperfectly or rarely done in the general life. Man has gone but little way; now he is waiting to see whether Woman can keep step with him; but, instead of calling but, like a good brother, \u201cYou can do it, if you only think so,\u201d or impersonally, \u201cAny one can do what he tries to do;\u201d he often discourages with school-boy brag: \u201cGirls can't do that; girls can't play ball.\u201d But let any one defy their taunts, break through and be brave and secure, they rend the air with shouts.\n\nThis fluctuation was obvious in a narrative I have lately seen, the story of the life of Countess Emily Plater, the heroine of the last revolution in Poland. The dignity, the purity, the concentrated resolve, the calm, deep enthusiasm, which yet could, when occasion called, sparkle up a holy, an indignant fire, make of this young maiden the figure I want for my frontispiece. Her portrait is to be seen in the book, a gentle shadow of her soul. Short was the career. Like the Maid of Orleans, she only did enough to verify her credentials, and then passed from a scene on which she was, probably, a premature apparition.\n\nWhen the young girl joined the army, where the report of her exploits had preceded her, she was received in a manner that marks the usual state of feeling. Some of the officers were disappointed at her quiet manners; that she had not the air and tone of a stage-heroine. They thought she could not have acted heroically unless in buskins; had no idea that such deeds only showed the habit of her mind. Others talked of the delicacy of her sex, advised her to withdraw from perils and dangers, and had no comprehension of the feelings within her breast that made this impossible. The gentle irony of her reply to these self-constituted tutors (not one of whom showed himself her equal in conduct or reason), is as good as her indignant reproof at a later period to the general, whose perfidy ruined all.\n\nBut though, to the mass of these men, she was an embarrassment and a puzzle, the nobler sort viewed her with a tender enthusiasm worthy of her. \u201cHer name,\u201d said her biographer, \u201cis known throughout Europe. I paint her character that she may be as widely loved.\u201d\n\nWith pride, he shows her freedom from all personal affections; that, though tender and gentle in an uncommon degree, there was no room for a private love in her consecrated life. She inspired those who knew her with a simple energy of feeling like her own. \u201cWe have seen,\u201d they felt, \u201ca woman worthy the name, capable of all sweet affections, capable of stern virtue.\u201d\n\nIt is a fact worthy of remark, that all these revolutions in favor of liberty have produced female champions that share the same traits, but Emily alone has found a biographer. Only a near friend could have performed for her this task, for the flower was reared in feminine seclusion, and the few and simple traits of her history before her appearance in the field could only have been known to the domestic circle. Her biographer has gathered them up with a brotherly devotion.\n\nNo! Man is not willingly ungenerous. He wants faith and love, because he is not yet himself an elevated being. He cries, with sneering scepticism, \u201cGive us a sign.\u201d But if the sign appears, his eyes glisten, and he offers not merely approval, but homage.\n\nThe severe nation which taught that the happiness of the race was forfeited through the fault of a Woman, and showed its thought of what sort of regard Man owed her, by making him accuse her on the first question to his God,\u2014who gave her to the patriarch as a handmaid, and, by the Mosaical law, bound her to allegiance like a serf,\u2014even they greeted, with solemn rapture, all great and holy women as heroines, prophetesses, judges in Israel; and, if they made Eve listen to the serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit. In other nations it has been the same down to our day. To the Woman who could conquer a triumph was awarded. And not only those whose strength was recommended to the heart by association with goodness and beauty, but those who were bad, if they were steadfast and strong, had their claims allowed. In any age a Semiramis, an Elizabeth of England, a Catharine of Russia, makes her place good, whether in a large or small circle. How has a little wit, a little genius, been celebrated in a Woman! What an intellectual triumph was that of the lonely Aspasia, and how heartily acknowledged! She, indeed, met a Pericles. But what annalist, the rudest of men, the most plebeian of husbands, will spare from his page one of the few anecdotes of Roman women\u2014Sappho! Eloisa! The names are of threadbare celebrity. Indeed, they were not more suitably met in their own time than the Countess Colonel Plater on her first joining the army. They had much to mourn, and their great impulses did not find due scope. But with time enough, space enough, their kindred appear on the scene. Across the ages, forms lean, trying to touch the hem of their retreating robes. The youth here by my side cannot be weary of the fragments from the life of Sappho. He will not believe they are not addressed to himself, or that he to whom they were addressed could be ungrateful. A recluse of high powers devotes himself to understand and explain the thought of Eloisa; he asserts her vast superiority in soul and genius to her master; he curses the fate that casts his lot in another age than hers. He could have understood her; he would have been to her a friend, such as Abelard never could. And this one Woman he could have loved and reverenced, and she, alas! lay cold in her grave hundreds of years ago. His sorrow is truly pathetic. These responses, that come too late to give joy, are as tragic as anything we know, and yet the tears of later ages glitter as they fall on Tasso's prison bars. And we know how elevating to the captive is the security that somewhere an intelligence must answer to his.\n\nThe Man habitually most narrow towards Woman will be flushed, as by the worst assault on Christianity, if you say it has made no improvement in her condition. Indeed, those most opposed to new acts in her favor, are jealous of the reputation of those which have been done.\n\nWe will not speak of the enthusiasm excited by actresses, improvisatrici, female singers,\u2014for here mingles the charm of beauty and grace,\u2014but female authors, even learned women, if not insufferably ugly and slovenly, from the Italian professor's daughter who taught behind the curtain, down to Mrs. Carter and Madame Dacier, are sure of an admiring audience, and, what is far better, chance to use what they have learned, and to learn more, if they can once get a platform on which to stand.\n\nBut how to get this platform, or how to make it of reasonably easy access, is the difficulty. Plants of great vigor will almost always struggle into blossom, despite impediments. But there should be encouragement, and a free genial atmosphere for those of move timid sort, fair play for each in its own kind. Some are like the little, delicate flowers which love to hide in the dripping mosses, by the sides of mountain torrents, or in the shade of tall trees. But others require an open field, a rich and loosened soil, or they never show their proper hues.\n\nIt may be said that Man does not have his fair play either; his energies are repressed and distorted by the interposition of artificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself has put them there; they have grown out of his own imperfections. If there is a misfortune in Woman's lot, it is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do not mark her state; and, if they express her past ignorance, do not her present needs. As every Man is of Woman born, she has slow but sure means of redress; yet the sooner a general justness of thought makes smooth the path, the better.\n\nMan is of Woman born, and her face bends over him in infancy with an expression he can never quite forget. Eminent men have delighted to pay tribute to this image, and it is an hackneyed observation, that most men of genius boast some remarkable development in the mother. The rudest tar brushes off a tear with his coat-sleeve at the hallowed name. The other day, I met a decrepit old man of seventy, on a journey, who challenged the stage company to guess where he was going. They guessed aright, \u201cTo see your mother.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cshe is ninety-two, but has good eyesight still, they say. I have not seen her these forty years, and I thought I could not die in peace without.\u201d I should have liked his picture painted as a companion-piece to that of a boisterous little boy, whom I saw attempt to declaim at a school exhibition\u2014\n\n\u201cO that those lips had language! Life has passed\nWith me but roughly since I heard thee last.\u201d\nHe got but very little way before sudden tears shamed him from the stage.\n\nSome gleams of the same expression which shone down upon his infancy, angelically pure and benign, visit Man again with hopes of pure love, of a holy marriage. Or, if not before, in the eyes of the mother of his child they again are seen, and dim fancies pass before his mind, that Woman may not have been born for him alone, but have come from heaven, a commissioned soul, a messenger of truth and love; that she can only make for him a home in which he may lawfully repose, in so far as she is\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTrue to the kindred points of Heaven and home.\u201d\n\nIn gleams, in dim fancies, this thought visits the mind of common men. It is soon obscured by the mists of sensuality, the dust of routine, and he thinks it was only some meteor or ignis fatuus that shone. But, as a Rosicrucian lamp, it burns unwearied, though condemned to the solitude of tombs; and to its permanent life, as to every truth, each age has in some form borne witness. For the truths, which visit the minds of careless men only in fitful gleams, shine with radiant clearness into those of the poet, the priest, and the artist.\n\nWhatever may have been the domestic manners of the ancients, the idea of Woman was nobly manifested in their mythologies and poems, whore she appears as Site in the Ramayana, a form of tender purity; as the Egyptian Isis, [Footnote: For an adequate description of the Isis, see Appendix A.] of divine wisdom never yet surpassed. In Egypt, too, the Sphynx, walking the earth with lion tread, looked out upon its marvels in the calm, inscrutable beauty of a virgin's face, and the Greek could only add wings to the great emblem. In Greece, Ceres and Proserpine, significantly termed \u201cthe great goddesses,\u201d were seen seated side by side. They needed not to rise for any worshipper or any change; they were prepared for all things, as those initiated to their mysteries knew. More obvious is the meaning of these three forms, the Diana, Minerva, and Vesta. Unlike in the expression of their beauty, but alike in this,\u2014that each was self-sufficing. Other forms were only accessories and illustrations, none the complement to one like these. Another might, indeed, be the companion, and the Apollo and Diana set off one another's beauty. Of the Vesta, it is to be observed, that not only deep-eyed, deep-discerning Greece, but ruder Rome, who represents the only form of good man (the always busy warrior) that could be indifferent to Woman, confided the permanence of its glory to a tutelary goddess, and her wisest legislator spoke of meditation as a nymph.\n\nPerhaps in Rome the neglect of Woman was a reaction on the manners of Etruria, where the priestess Queen, warrior Queen, would seem to have been so usual a character.\n\nAn instance of the noble Roman marriage, where the stern and calm nobleness of the nation was common to both, we see in the historic page through the little that is told us of Brutus and Portia. Shakspeare has seized on the relation in its native lineaments, harmonizing the particular with the universal; and, while it is conjugal love, and no other, making it unlike the same relation as seen in Cymbeline, or Othello, even as one star differeth from another in glory.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy that great vow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which did incorporate and make us one,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfold to me, yourself, your other half,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why you are heavy. ...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dwell I but in the suburbs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of your good pleasure?

In Sparta, thought, in this respect as in all others, was expressed in the characters of real life, and the women of Sparta were as much Spartans as the men. The \u201ccitoyen, citoyenne\u201d of France was here actualized. Was not the calm equality they enjoyed as honorable as the devotion of chivalry? They intelligently shared the ideal life of their nation.\n\nLike the men they felt:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonor gone, all's gone:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better never have been born.\u201d\n\nThey were the true friends of men. The Spartan, surely, would not think that he received only his body from his mother. The sage, had he lived in that community, could not have thought the souls of \u201cvain and foppish men will be degraded after death to the forms of women; and, if they do not then make great efforts to retrieve themselves, will become birds.\u201d\n\n(By the way, it is very expressive of the hard intellectuality of the merely mannish mind, to speak thus of birds, chosen always by the feminine poet as the symbols of his fairest thoughts.)\n\nWe are told of the Greek nations in general, that Woman occupied there an infinitely lower place than Man. It is difficult to believe this, when we see such range and dignity of thought on the subject in the mythologies, and find the poets producing such ideals as Cassandra, Iphigenia, Antigone, Macaria; where Sibylline priestesses told the oracle of the highest god, and he could not be content to reign with a, court of fewer than nine muses. Even Victory wore a female form.\n\nBut, whatever were the facts of daily life, I cannot complain of the age and nation which represents its thought by such a symbol as I see before me at this moment. It is a zodiac of the busts of gods and goddesses, arranged in pairs. The circle breathes the music of a heavenly order. Male and female heads are distinct in expression, but equal in beauty, strength and calmness. Each male head is that of a brother and a king,\u2014each female of a sister and a queen. Could the thought thus expressed be lived out, there would be nothing more to be desired. There would be unison in variety, congeniality in difference.\n\nComing nearer our own time, we find religion and poetry no less true in their revelations. The rude man, just disengaged from the sod, the Adam, accuses Woman to his God, and records her disgrace to their posterity. He is not ashamed to write that he could be drawn from heaven by one beneath him,\u2014one made, he says, from but a small part of himself. But in the same nation, educated by time, instructed by a succession of prophets, we find Woman in as high a position as she has ever occupied, No figure that has ever arisen to greet our eyes has been received with more fervent reverence than that of the Madonna. Heine calls her the Dame du Comptoir of the Catholic church, and this jeer well expresses a serious truth.\n\nAnd not only this holy and significant image was worshipped by the pilgrim, and the favorite subject of the artist, but it exercised an immediate influence on the destiny of the sex. The empresses who embraced the cross converted sons and husbands. Whole calendars of female saints, heroic dames of chivalry, binding the emblem of faith on the heart of the best-beloved, and wasting the bloom of youth in separation and loneliness, for the sake of duties they thought it religion to assume, with innumerable forms of poesy, trace their lineage to this one. Nor, however imperfect may be the action, in our day, of the faith thus expressed, and though we can scarcely think it nearer this ideal than that of India or Greece was near their ideal, is it in vain that the truth has been recognized, that Woman is not only a part of Man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, born that men might not be lonely\u2014but that women are in themselves possessors of and possessed by immortal souls. This truth undoubtedly received a greater outward stability from the belief of the church that the earthly parent of the Saviour of souls was a woman.\n\nThe Assumption of the Virgin, as painted by sublime artists, as also Petrarch's Hymn to the Madonna, [Footnote: Appendix B.] cannot have spoken to the world wholly without result, yet oftentimes those who had ears heard not.\n\nSee upon the nations the influence of this powerful example. In Spain look only at the ballads. Woman in these is \u201cvery Woman;\u201d she is the betrothed, the bride, the spouse of Man; there is on her no hue of the philosopher, the heroine, the savante, but she looks great and noble. Why? Because she is also, through her deep devotion, the betrothed of Heaven. Her upturned eyes have drawn down the light that casts a radiance round her. See only such a ballad as that of \u201cLady Teresa's Bridal,\u201d where the Infanta, given to the Moorish bridegroom, calls down the vengeance of Heaven on his unhallowed passion, and thinks it not too much to expiate by a life in the cloister the involuntary stain upon her princely youth. [Footnote: Appendix C.] It was this constant sense of claims above those of earthly love or happiness that made the Spanish lady who shared this spirit a guerdon to be won by toils and blood and constant purity, rather than a chattel to be bought for pleasure and service.\n\nGermany did hot need to learn a high view of Woman; it was inborn in that race. Woman was to the Teuton warrior his priestess, his friend, his sister,\u2014in truth, a wife. And the Christian statues of noble pairs, as they lie above their graves in stone, expressing the meaning of all the by-gone pilgrimage by hands folded in mutual prayer, yield not a nobler sense of the place and powers of Woman than belonged to the altvater day. The holy love of Christ which summoned them, also, to choose \u201cthe better part\u2014that which could not be taken from them,\u201d refined and hallowed in this nation a native faith; thus showing that it was not the warlike spirit alone that left the Latins so barbarous in this respect.\n\nBut the Germans, taking so kindly to this thought, did it the more justice. The idea of Woman in their literature is expressed both to a greater height and depth than elsewhere.\n\nI will give as instances the themes of three ballads:\n\nOne is upon a knight who had always the name of the Virgin on his lips. This protected him all his life through, in various and beautiful modes, both from sin and other dangers; and, when he died, a plant sprang from his grave, which so gently whispered the Ave Maria that none could pass it by with an unpurified heart.\n\nAnother is one of the legends of the famous Drachenfels. A maiden, one of the earliest converts to Christianity, was carried by the enraged populace to this dread haunt of \u201cthe dragon's fabled brood,\u201d to be their prey. She was left alone, but undismayed, for she knew in whom she trusted. So, when the dragons came rushing towards her, she showed them a crucifix and they crouched reverently at her feet. Next day the people came, and, seeing these wonders, were all turned to the faith which exalts the lowly.\n\nThe third I have in mind is another of the Rhine legends. A youth is sitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle, her fairy kingdom, then perfumed by the blossoming grape-vines which draped its bowers. They are happy; all blossoms with them, and life promises its richest vine. A boat approaches on the tide; it pauses at their foot. It brings, perhaps, some joyous message, fresh dew for their flowers, fresh light on the wave. No! it is the usual check on such great happiness. The father of the count departs for the crusade; will his son join him, or remain to rule their domain, and wed her he loves? Neither of the affianced pair hesitates a moment. \u201cI must go with my father,\u201d\u2014\u201dThou must go with thy father.\u201d It was one thought, one word. \u201cI will be here again,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen these blossoms have turned to purple grapes.\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d she sighed, while the prophetic sense said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAnd there she waited, and the grapes ripened, and were gathered into the vintage, and he came not. Year after year passed thus, and no tidings; yet still she waited.\n\nHe, meanwhile, was in a Moslem prison. Long he languished there without hope, till, at last, his patron saint appeared in vision and announced his release, but only on condition of his joining the monastic order for the service of the saint.\n\nAnd so his release was effected, and a safe voyage home given. And once more he sets sail upon the Rhine. The maiden, still watching beneath the vines, sees at last the object of all this patient love approach\u2014approach, but not to touch the strand to which she, with outstretched arms, has rushed. He dares not trust himself to land, but in low, heart-broken tones, tells her of Heaven's will; and that he, in obedience to his vow, is now on his way to a convent on the river-bank, there to pass the rest of his earthly life in the service of the shrine. And then he turns his boat, and floats away from her and hope of any happiness in this world, but urged, as he believes, by the breath of Heaven.\n\nThe maiden stands appalled, but she dares not murmur, and cannot hesitate long. She also bids them prepare her boat. She follows her lost love to the convent gate, requests an interview with the abbot, and devotes her Elysian isle, where vines had ripened their ruby fruit in vain for her, to the service of the monastery where her love was to serve. Then, passing over to the nunnery opposite, she takes the veil, and meets her betrothed at the altar; and for a life-long union, if not the one they had hoped in earlier years.\n\nIs not this sorrowful story of a lofty beauty? Does it not show a sufficiently high view of Woman, of Marriage? This is commonly the chivalric, still more the German view.\n\nYet, wherever there was a balance in the mind of Man, of sentiment with intellect, such a result was sure. The Greek Xenophon has not only painted us a sweet picture of the domestic Woman, in his Economics, but in the Cyropedia has given, in the picture of Panthea, a view of Woman which no German picture can surpass, whether lonely and quiet with veiled lids, the temple of a vestal loveliness, or with eyes flashing, and hair flowing to the free wind, cheering on the hero to fight for his God, his country, or whatever name his duty might bear at the time. This picture I shall copy by and by. Yet Xenophon grew up in the same age with him who makes Iphigenia say to Achilles,\n\n\u201cBetter a thousand women should perish than one man cease to see\nthe light.\u201d\nThis was the vulgar Greek sentiment. Xenophon, aiming at the ideal Man, caught glimpses of the ideal Woman also. From the figure of a Cyrus the Pantheas stand not afar. They do not in thought; they would not in life.\n\nI could swell the catalogue of instances far beyond the reader's patience. But enough have been brought forward to show that, though there has been great disparity betwixt the nations as between individuals in their culture on this point, yet the idea of Woman has always cast some rays and often been forcibly represented.\n\nFar less has Woman to complain that she has not had her share of power. This, in all ranks of society, except the lowest, has been hers to the extent that vanity would crave, far beyond what wisdom would accept. In the very lowest, where Man, pressed by poverty, sees in Woman only the partner of toils and cares, and cannot hope, scarcely has an idea of, a comfortable home, he often maltreats her, and is less influenced by her. In all ranks, those who are gentle and uncomplaining, too candid to intrigue, too delicate to encroach, suffer much. They suffer long, and are kind; verily, they have their reward. But wherever Man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty, or brutal stupidity, to care for the comforts of the fireside, or the bloom and ornament of life, Woman has always power enough, if she choose to exert it, and is usually disposed to do so, in proportion to her ignorance and childish vanity. Unacquainted with the importance of life and its purposes, trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty power, she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at the moment, and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to gratify the pique of a female favorite. The English shopkeeper's wife does not vote, but it is for her interest that the politician canvasses by the coarsest flattery. France suffers no woman on her throne, but her proud nobles kiss the dust at the feet of Pompadour and Dubarry; for such flare in the lighted foreground where a Roland would modestly aid in the closet. Spain (that same Spain which sang of Ximena and the Lady Teresa) shuts up her women in the care of duennas, and allows them no book but the breviary; but the ruin follows only the more surely from the worthless favorite of a worthless queen. Relying on mean precautions, men indeed cry peace, peace, where there is no peace.\n\nIt is not the transient breath of poetic incense that women want; each can receive that from a lover. It is not life-long sway; it needs but to become a coquette, a shrew, or a good cook, to be sure of that. It is not money, nor notoriety, nor the badges of authority which men have appropriated to themselves. If demands, made in their behalf, lay stress on any of these particulars, those who make them have not searched deeply into the need. The want is for that which at once includes these and precludes them; which would not be forbidden power, lest there be temptation to steal and misuse it; which would not have the mind perverted by flattery from a worthiness of esteem; it is for that which is the birthright of every being capable of receiving it,\u2014the freedom, the religious, the intelligent freedom of the universe to use its means, to learn its secret, as far as Nature has enabled them, with God alone for their guide and their judge.\n\nYe cannot believe it, men; but the only reason why women over assume what is more appropriate to you, is because you prevent them from finding out what is fit for themselves. Were they free, were they wise fully to develop the strength and beauty of Woman; they would never wish to be men, or man-like. The well-instructed moon flies not from her orbit to seize on the glories of her partner. No; for she knows that one law rules, one heaven contains, one universe replies to them alike. It is with women as with the slave:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVor dem Sklaven, wenn er die Kette bricht,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vor dem frelen Menschen erzittert nicht.\u201d\n\nTremble not before the free man, but before the slave who has chains to break.\n\nIn slavery, acknowledged slavery, women are on a par with men. Each is a work-tool, an article of property, no more! In perfect freedom, such as is painted in Olympus, in Swedenborg's angelic state, in the heaven where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, each is a purified intelligence, an enfranchised soul,\u2014no less.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJene himmlische Gestalten\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sie fragen nicht nach Mann und Welb,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Und keine kielder, keine Falten\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Umgeben den verklarten Leib.\u201d\n\nThe child who song this was a prophetic form, expressive of the longing for a state of perfect freedom, pure love. She could not remain here, but was translated to another air. And it may be that the air of this earth will never be so tempered that such can bear it long. But, while they stay, they must bear testimony to the truth they are constituted to demand.\n\nThat an era approaches which shall approximate nearer to such a temper than any has yet done, there are many tokens; indeed, so many that only a few of the most prominent can here be enumerated.\n\nThe reigns of Elizabeth of England and Isabella of Castile foreboded this era. They expressed the beginning of the new state; while they forwarded its progress. These were strong characters, and in harmony with the wants of their time. One showed that this strength did not unfit a woman for the duties of a wife and a mother; the other, that it could enable her to live and die alone, a wide energetic life, a courageous death. Elizabeth is certainly no pleasing example. In rising above the weakness, she did not lay aside the foibles ascribed to her sex; but her strength must be respected now, as it was in her own time.\n\nMary Stuart and Elizabeth seem types, moulded by the spirit of the time, and placed upon an elevated platform, to show to the coming ages Woman such as the conduct and wishes of Man in general is likely to make her. The first shows Woman lovely even to allurement; quick in apprehension and weak in judgment; with grace and dignity of sentiment, but no principle; credulous and indiscreet, yet artful; capable of sudden greatness or of crime, but not of a steadfast wisdom, nor self-restraining virtue. The second reveals Woman half-emancipated and jealous of her freedom, such as she has figured before or since in many a combative attitude, mannish, not equally manly; strong and prudent more than great or wise; able to control vanity, and the wish to rule through coquetry and passion, but not to resign these dear deceits from the very foundation, as unworthy a being capable of truth and nobleness. Elizabeth, taught by adversity, put on her virtues as armor, more than produced them in a natural order from her soul. The time and her position called on her to act the wise sovereign, and she was proud that she could do so, but her tastes and inclinations would have led her to act the weak woman. She was without magnanimity of any kind.\n\nWe may accept as an omen for ourselves that it was Isabella who furnished Columbus with the means of coming hither. This land must pay back its debt to Woman, without whose aid it would not have been brought into alliance with the civilized world.\n\nA graceful and meaning figure is that introduced to us by Mr. Prescott, in the Conquest of Mexico, in the Indian girl Marina, who accompanied Cortez, and was his interpreter in all the various difficulties of his career. She stood at his side, on the walls of the besieged palace, to plead with her enraged countrymen. By her name he was known in New Spain, and, after the conquest, her gentle intercession was often of avail to the conquered. The poem of the Future may be read in some features of the story of \u201cMalinche.\u201d\n\nThe influence of Elizabeth on literature was real, though, by sympathy with its finer productions, she was no more entitled to give name to an era than Queen Anne. It was simply that the fact of having a female sovereign on the throne affected the course of a writer's thoughts. In this sense, the presence of a woman on the throne always makes its mark. Life is lived before the eyes of men, by which their imaginations are stimulated as to the possibilities of Woman. \u201cWe will die for our king, Maria, Theresa,\u201d cry the wild warriors, clashing their swords; and the sounds vibrate through the poems of that generation. The range of female character in Spenser alone might content us for one period. Britomart and Belphoebe have as much room on the canvas as Florimel; and, where this is the case, the haughtiest Amazon will not murmur that Una should be felt to be the fairest type.\n\nUnlike as was the English queen to a fairy queen, we may yet conceive that it was the image of a queen before the poet's mind that called up this splendid court of women. Shakspeare's range is also great; but he has left out the heroic characters, such as the Macaria of Greece, the Britomart of Spenser. Ford and Massinger have, in this respect, soared to a higher flight of feeling than he. It was the holy and heroic Woman they most loved, and if they could not paint an Imogen, a Desdemona, a Rosalind, yet, in those of a stronger mould, they showed a higher ideal, though with so much less poetic power to embody it, than we see in Portia or Isabella, the simple truth of Cordelia, indeed, is of this sort. The beauty of Cordelia is neither male nor female; it is the beauty of virtue.\n\nThe ideal of love and marriage rose high in the mind of all the Christian nations who were capable of grave and deep feeling. We may take as examples of its English aspect the lines,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI could not love thee, dear, so much,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loved I not honor more.\u201d\n\nOr the address of the Commonwealth's man to his wife, as she looked out from the Tower window to see him, for the last time, on his way to the scaffold. He stood up in the cart, waved his hat, and cried, \u201cTo Heaven, my love, to Heaven, and leave you in the storm!\u201d\n\nSuch was the love of faith and honor,\u2014a love which stopped, like Colonel Hutchinson's, \u201con this side idolatry,\u201d because it was religious. The meeting of two such souls Donne describes as giving birth to an \u201cabler soul.\u201d\n\nLord Herbert wrote to his love,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWere not our souls immortal made,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our equal loves can make them such.\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cBroken Heart,\u201d of Ford, Penthea, a character which engages my admiration even more deeply than the famous one of Calanthe, is made to present to the mind the most beautiful picture of what these relations should be in their purity. Her life cannot sustain the violation of what she so clearly feels.\n\nShakspeare, too, saw that, in true love, as in fire, the utmost ardor is coincident with the utmost purity. It is a true lover that exclaims in the agony of Othello,\n\n\u201cIf thou art false, O then Heaven mocks Itself!\u201d\nThe son, framed, like Hamlet, to appreciate truth in all the beauty of relations, sinks into deep melancholy when he finds his natural expectations disappointed. He has no other. She to whom he gave the name, disgraces from his heart's shrine all the sex.\n\n\u201cFrailty, thy name is Woman.\u201d\nIt is because a Hamlet could find cause to say so, that I have put the line, whose stigma has never been removed, at the head of my work. But, as a lover, surely Hamlet would not have so far mistaken, as to have finished with such a conviction. He would have felt the faith of Othello, and that faith could not, in his more dispassionate mind, have been disturbed by calumny.\n\nIn Spain, this thought is arrayed in a sublimity which belongs to the sombre and passionate genius of the nation. Calderon's Justina resists all the temptation of the Demon, and raises her lover, with her, above the sweet lures of mere temporal happiness. Their marriage is vowed at the stake; their goals are liberated together by the martyr flame into \u201ca purer state of sensation and existence.\u201d\n\nIn Italy, the great poets wove into their lives an ideal love which answered to the highest wants. It included those of the intellect and the affections, for it was a love of spirit for spirit. It was not ascetic, or superhuman, but, interpreting all things, gave their proper beauty to details of the common life, the common day. The poet spoke of his love, not as a flower to place in his bosom, or hold carelessly in his hand, but as a light toward which he must find wings to fly, or \u201ca stair to heaven.\u201d He delighted to speak of her, not only as the bride of his heart, but the mother of his soul; for he saw that, in cases where the right direction had been taken, the greater delicacy of her frame and stillness of her life left her more open than is Man to spiritual influx. So he did not look upon her as betwixt him and earth, to serve his temporal needs, but, rather, betwixt him and heaven, to purify his affections and lead him to wisdom through love. He sought, in her, not so much the Eve as the Madonna.\n\nIn these minds the thought, which gleams through all the legends of chivalry, shines in broad intellectual effulgence, not to be misinterpreted; and their thought is reverenced by the world, though it lies far from the practice of the world as yet,\u2014so far that it seems as though a gulf of death yawned between.\n\nEven with such men the practice was, often, widely different from the mental faith. I say mental; for if the heart were thoroughly alive with it, the practice could not be dissonant. Lord Herbert's was a marriage of convention, made for him at fifteen; he was not discontented with it, but looked only to the advantages it brought of perpetuating his family on the basis of a great fortune. He paid, in act, what he considered a dutiful attention to the bond; his thoughts travelled elsewhere; and while forming a high ideal of the companionship of minds in marriage, he seems never to have doubted that its realization must be postponed to some other state of being. Dante, almost immediately after the death of Beatrice, married a lady chosen for him by his friends, and Boccaccio, in describing the miseries that attended, in this case,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe form of an union where union is none,\u201d\n\nspeaks as if these were inevitable to the connection, and as if the scholar and poet, especially, could expect nothing but misery and obstruction in a domestic partnership with Woman.\n\nCenturies have passed since, but civilized Europe is still in a transition state about marriage; not only in practice but in thought. It is idle to speak with contempt of the nations where polygamy is an institution, or seraglios a custom, while practices far more debasing haunt, well-nigh fill, every city and every town, and so far as union of one with one is believed to be the only pure form of marriage, a great majority of societies and individuals are still doubtful whether the earthly bond must be a meeting of souls, or only supposes a contract of convenience and utility. Were Woman established in the rights of an immortal being, this could not be. She would not, in some countries, be given away by her father, with scarcely more respect for her feelings than is shown by the Indian chief, who sells his daughter for a horse, and beats her if she runs away from her new home. Nor, in societies where her choice is left free, would she be perverted, by the current of opinion that seizes her, into the belief that she must marry, if it be only to find a protector, and a home of her own. Neither would Man, if he thought the connection of permanent importance, form it so lightly. He would not deem it a trifle, that he was to enter into the closest relations with another soul, which, if not eternal in themselves, must eternally affect his growth. Neither, did he believe Woman capable of friendship, [Footnote: See Appendix D, Spinoza's view] would he, by rash haste, lose the chance of finding a friend in the person who might, probably, live half a century by his side. Did love, to his mind, stretch forth into infinity, he would not miss his chance of its revelations, that he might the sooner rest from his weariness by a bright fireside, and secure a sweet and graceful attendant \u201cdevoted to him alone.\u201d Were he a step higher, he would not carelessly enter into a relation where he might not be able to do the duty of a friend, as well as a protector from external ill, to the other party, and have a being in his power pining for sympathy, intelligence and aid, that he could not give.\n\nWhat deep communion, what real intercourse is implied in sharing the joys and cares of parentage, when any degree of equality is admitted between the parties! It is true that, in a majority of instances, the man looks upon his wife as an adopted child, and places her to the other children in the relation of nurse or governess, rather than that of parent. Her influence with them is sure; but she misses the education which should enlighten that influence, by being thus treated. It is the order of nature that children should complete the education, moral and mental, of parents, by making them think what is needed for the best culture of human beings, and conquer all faults and impulses that interfere with their giving this to these dear objects, who represent the world to them. Father and mother should assist one another to learn what is required for this sublime priesthood of Nature. But, for this, a religious recognition of equality is required.\n\nWhere this thought of equality begins to diffuse itself, it is shown in four ways.\n\nFirst;\u2014The household partnership. In our country, the woman looks for a \u201csmart but kind\u201d husband; the man for a \u201ccapable, sweet-tempered\u201d wife. The man furnishes the house; the woman regulates it. Their relation is one of mutual esteem, mutual dependence. Their talk is of business; their affection shows itself by practical kindness. They know that life goes more smoothly and cheerfully to each for the other's aid; they are grateful and content. The wife praises her husband as a \u201cgood provider;\u201d the husband, in return, compliments her as a \u201ccapital housekeeper.\u201d This relation is good so far as it goes.\n\nNext comes a closer tie, which takes the form either of mutual idolatry or of intellectual companionship. The first, we suppose, is to no one a pleasing subject of contemplation. The parties weaken and narrow one another; they lock the gate against all the glories of the universe, that they may live in a cell together. To themselves they seem the only wise; to all others, steeped in infatuation; the gods smile as they look forward to the crisis of cure; to men, the woman seems an unlovely syren; to women, the man an effeminate boy.\n\nThe other form, of intellectual companionship, has become more and more frequent. Men engaged in public life, literary men, and artists, have often found in their wives companions and confidants in thought no less than in feeling. And, as the intellectual development of Woman has spread wider and risen higher, they have, not unfrequently, shared the same employment; as in the case of Roland and his wife, who were friends in the household and in the nation's councils, read, regulated home affairs, or prepared public documents together, indifferently. It is very pleasant, in letters begun by Roland and finished by his wife, to see the harmony of mind, and the difference of nature; one thought, but various ways of treating it.\n\nThis is one of the best instances of a marriage of friendship. It was only friendship, whose basis was esteem; probably neither party knew love, except by name. Roland was a good man, worthy to esteem, and be esteemed; his wife as deserving of admiration as able to do without it.\n\nMadame Roland is the fairest specimen we yet have of her class; as clear to discern her aim, as valiant to pursue it, as Spenser's Britomart; austerely set apart from all that did not belong to her, whether as Woman or as mind. She is an antetype of a class to which the coming time will afford a field\u2014the Spartan matron, brought by the culture of the age of books to intellectual consciousness and expansion. Self-sufficingness, strength, and clearsightedness were, in her, combined with a power of deep and calm affection. She, too, would have given a son or husband the device for his shield, \u201cReturn with it or upon it;\u201d and this, not because she loved little, but much. The page of her life is one of unsullied dignity. Her appeal to posterity is one against the injustice of those who committed such crimes in the name of Liberty. She makes it in behalf of herself and her husband. I would put beside it, on the shelf, a little volume, containing a similar appeal from the verdict of contemporaries to that of mankind, made by Godwin in behalf of his wife, the celebrated, the by most men detested, Mary Wolstonecraft. In his view, it was an appeal from the injustice of those who did such wrong in the name of virtue. Were this little book interesting for no other cause, it would be so for the generous affection evinced under the peculiar circumstances. This man had courage to love and honor this woman in the face of the world's sentence, and of all that was repulsive in her own past history. He believed he saw of what soul she was, and that the impulses she had struggled to act out were noble, though the opinions to which they had led might not be thoroughly weighed. He loved her, and he defended her for the meaning and tendency of her inner life. It was a good fact.\n\nMary Wolstonecraft, like Madame Dudevant (commonly known as George Sand) in our day, was a woman whose existence better proved the need of some new interpretation of Woman's Rights than anything she wrote. Such beings as these, rich in genius, of most tender sympathies, capable of high virtue and a chastened harmony, ought not to find themselves, by birth, in a place so narrow, that, in breaking bonds, they become outlaws. Were there as much room in the world for such, as in Spenser's poem for Britomart, they would not run their heads so wildly against the walls, but prize their shelter rather. They find their way, at last, to light and air, but the world will not take off the brand it has set upon them. The champion of the Rights of Woman found, in Godwin, one who would plead that cause like a brother. He who delineated with such purity of traits the form of Woman in the Marguerite, of whom the weak St. Leon could never learn to be worthy,\u2014a pearl indeed whose price was above rubies,\u2014was not false in life to the faith by which he had hallowed his romance. He acted, as he wrote, like a brother. This form of appeal rarely fails to touch the basest man:\u2014\u201dAre you acting toward other women in the way you would have men act towards your sister?\u201d George Sand smokes, wears male attire, wishes to be addressed as \u201cMon fr\u00e8re;\u201d\u2014perhaps, if she found those who were as brothers indeed, she would not care whether she were brother or sister. [Footnote: A note appended by my sister in this place, in the first edition, is here omitted, because it is incorporated in another article in this volume, treating of George Sand more at length.\u2014[ED.]] We rejoice to see that she, who expresses such a painful contempt for men in most of her works, as shows she must have known great wrong from them, depicts, in \u201cLa Roche Mauprat,\u201d a man raised by the workings of love from the depths of savage sensualism to a moral and intellectual life. It was love for a pure object, for a steadfast woman, one of those who, the Italian said, could make the \u201cstair to heaven.\u201d\n\nThis author, beginning like the many in assault upon bad institutions, and external ills, yet deepening the experience through comparative freedom, sees at last that the only efficient remedy must come from individual character. These bad institutions, indeed, it may always be replied, prevent individuals from forming good character, therefore we must remove them. Agreed; yet keep steadily the higher aim in view. Could you clear away all the bad forms of society, it is vain, unless the individual begin to be ready for better. There must be a parallel movement in these two branches of life. And all the rules left by Moses availed less to further the best life than the living example of one Messiah.\n\nStill the mind of the age struggles confusedly with these problems, better discerning as yet the ill it can no longer bear, than the good by which it may supersede it. But women like Sand will speak now and cannot be silenced; their characters and their eloquence alike foretell an era when such as they shall easier learn to lead true lives. But though such forebode, not such shall be parents of it. [Footnote: Appendix E.] Those who would reform the world must show that they do not speak in the heat of wild impulse; their lives must be unstained by passionate error; they must be severe lawgivers to themselves. They must be religious students of the divine purpose with regard to man, if they would not confound the fancies of a day with the requisitions of eternal good. Their liberty must be the liberty of law and knowledge. But as to the transgressions against custom which have caused such outcry against those of noble intention, it may be observed that the resolve of Eloisa to be only the mistress of Abelard, was that of one who saw in practice around her the contract of marriage made the seal of degradation. Shelley feared not to be fettered, unless so to be was to be false. Wherever abuses are seen, the timid will suffer; the bold will protest. But society has a right to outlaw them till she has revised her law; and this she must be taught to do, by one who speaks with authority, not in anger or haste.\n\nIf Godwin's choice of the calumniated authoress of the \u201cRights of Woman,\u201d for his honored wife, be a sign of a new era, no less so is an article to which I have alluded some pages back, published five or six years ago in one of the English Reviews, where the writer, in doing fall justice to Eloisa, shows his bitter regret that she lives not now to love him, who might have known bettor how to prize her love than did the egotistical Abelard.\n\nThese marriages, these characters, with all their imperfections, express an onward tendency. They speak of aspiration of soul, of energy of mind, seeking clearness and freedom. Of a like promise are the tracts lately published by Goodwyn Barmby (the European Pariah, as he calls himself) and his wife Catharine. Whatever we may think of their measures, we see in them wedlock; the two minds are wed by the only contract that can permanently avail, that of a common faith and a common purpose.\n\nWe might mention instances, nearer home, of minds, partners in work and in life, sharing together, on equal terms, public and private interests, and which wear not, on any side, the aspect of offence shown by those last-named: persons who steer straight onward, yet, in our comparatively free life, have not been obliged to run their heads against any wall. But the principles which guide them might, under petrified and oppressive institutions, have made them warlike, paradoxical, and, in some sense, Pariahs. The phenomena are different, the law is the same, in all these cases. Men and women have been obliged to build up their house anew from the very foundation. If they found stone ready in the quarry, they took it peaceably; otherwise they alarmed the country by pulling down old towers to get materials.\n\nThese are all instances of marriage as intellectual companionship. The parties meet mind to mind, and a mutual trust is produced, which can buckler them against a million. They work together for a common, purpose, and, in all these instances, with the same implement,\u2014the pen. The pen and the writing-desk furnish forth as naturally the retirement of Woman as of Man.\n\nA pleasing expression, in this kind, is afforded by the union in the names of the Howitts. William and Mary Howitt we heard named together for years, supposing them to be brother and sister; the equality of labors and reputation, even so, was auspicious; more so, now we find them man and wife. In his late work on Germany, Howitt mentions his wife, with pride, as one among the constellation of distinguished English-women, and in a graceful, simple manner. And still we contemplate with pleasure the partnership in literature and affection between the Howitts,\u2014the congenial pursuits and productions\u2014the pedestrian tours wherein the married pair showed that marriage, on a wide enough basis, does not destroy the \u201cinexhaustible\u201d entertainment which lovers find in one another's company.\n\nIn naming these instances, I do not mean to imply that community of employment is essential to the union of husband and wife, more than to the union of friends. Harmony exists in difference, no less than in likeness, if only the same key-note govern both parts. Woman the poem, Man the poet! Woman the heart, Man the head! Such divisions are only important when they are never to be transcended. If nature is never bound down, nor the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. We are pleased that women should write and speak, if they feel need of it, from having something to tell; but silence for ages would be no misfortune, if that silence be from divine command, and not from Man's tradition.\n\nWhile Goetz Von Berlichingen rides to battle, his wife is busy in the kitchen; but difference of occupation does not prevent that community of inward life, that perfect esteem, with which he says,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\u201d\n\nManzoni thus dedicates his \u201cAdelchi.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo his beloved and venerated wife, Enrichetta Luigia Blondel, who, with conjugal affection and maternal wisdom, has preserved a virgin mind, the author dedicates this 'Adelchi,' grieving that he could not, by a more splendid and more durable monument, honor the dear name, and the memory of so many virtues.\u201d\n\nThe relation could not be fairer, nor more equal, if she, too, had written poems. Yet the position of the parties might have been the reverse as well; the Woman might have sung the deeds, given voice to the life of the Man, and beauty would have been the result; as we see, in pictures of Arcadia, the nymph singing to the shepherds, or the shepherd, with his pipe, alluring the nymphs; either makes a good picture. The sounding lyre requires not muscular strength, but energy of soul to animate the hand which would control it. Nature seems to delight in varying the arrangements, as if to show that she will be fettered by no rule; and we must admit the same varieties that she admits.\n\nThe fourth and highest grade of marriage union is the religious, which may be expressed as pilgrimage toward a common shrine. This includes the others: home sympathies and household wisdom, for these pilgrims must know how to assist each other along the dusty way; intellectual communion, for how sad it would be on such a journey to have a companion to whom you could not communicate your thoughts and aspirations as they sprang to life; who would have no feeling for the prospects that open, more and more glorious as we advance; who would never see the flowers that may be gathered by the most industrious traveller! It must include all these.\n\nSuch a fellow-pilgrim Count Zinzendorf seems to have found in his countess, of whom he thus writes:\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years' experience has shown me that just the help-meet whom I have is the only one that could suit my vocation. Who else could have so carried through my family affairs? Who lived so spotlessly before the world? Who so wisely aided me in my rejection of a dry morality? Who so clearly set aside the Pharisaism which, as years passed, threatened to creep in among us? Who so deeply discerned as to the spirits of delusion which sought to bewilder us? Who would have governed my whole economy so wisely, richly and hospitably, when circumstances commanded? Who have taken indifferently the part of servant or mistress, without, on the one side, affecting an especial spirituality; on the other, being sullied by any worldly pride? Who, in a community where all ranks are eager to be on a level, would, from wise and real causes, have known how to maintain inward and outward distinctions? Who, without a murmur, have seen her husband encounter such dangers by land and sea? Who undertaken with him, and sustained, such astonishing pilgrimages? Who, amid such difficulties, would have always held up her head and supported me? Who found such vast sums of money, and acquitted them on her own credit? And, finally, who, of all human beings, could so well understand and interpret to others my inner and outer being as this one, of such nobleness in her way of thinking, such great intellectual capacity, and so free from the theological perplexities that enveloped me!\u201d\n\nLet any one peruse, with all intentness, the lineaments of this portrait, and see if the husband had not reason, with this air of solemn rapture and conviction, to challenge comparison? We are reminded of the majestic cadence of the line whose feet stop in the just proportion of Humanity,\n\n\u201cDaughter of God and Mati, accomplished Eve!\u201d\nAn observer [Footnote: Spangenberg] adds this testimony:\n\n\u201cWe may, in many marriages, regard it as the best arrangement, if the man has so much advantage over his wife, that she can, without much thought of her own, be led and directed by him as by a father. But it was not so with the count and his consort. She was not made to be a copy; she was an original; and, while she loved and honored him, she thought for herself, on all subjects, with so much intelligence, that he could and did look on her as a sister and friend also.\u201d\n\nCompare with this refined specimen of a religiously civilized life the following imperfect sketch of a North American Indian, and we shall see that the same causes will always produce the same results, The Flying Pigeon (Ratchewaine) was the wife of a barbarous chief, who had six others; but she was his only true wife, because the only one of a strong and pure character, and, having this, inspired a veneration, as like as the mind of the man permitted to that inspired by the Countess Zinzendorf. She died when her son was only four years old, yet left on his mind a feeling of reverent love worthy the thought of Christian chivalry. Grown to manhood, he shed tears on seeing her portrait.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE FLYING PIGEON.\n\n\u201cRatchewaine was chaste, mild, gentle in her disposition, kind, generous, and devoted to her husband. A harsh word was never known to proceed from her mouth; nor was she ever known to be in a passion. Mabaskah used to say of her, after her death, that her hand was shut when those who did not want came into her presence; but when the really poor came in, it was like a strainer full of holes, letting all she held in it pass through. In the exercise of generous feeling she was uniform, It was not indebted for its exercise to whim, nor caprice, nor partiality. No matter of what nation the applicant for her bounty was, or whether at war or peace with her nation; if he were hungry, she fed him; if naked, she clothed him; and, if houseless, she gave him shelter. The continued exercise of this generous feeling kept her poor. And she has been known to give away her last blanket\u2014all the honey that was in the lodge, the last bladder of bear's oil, and the last piece of dried meat.\n\n\u201cShe was scrupulously exact in the observance of all the religious rites which her faith imposed upon her. Her conscience is represented to have been extremely tender. She often feared that her acts were displeasing to the Great Spirit, when she would blacken her face, and retire to some lone place, and fast and pray.\u201d\n\nTo these traits should be added, but for want of room, anecdotes which show the quick decision and vivacity of her mind. Her face was in harmony with this combination. Her brow is as ideal and the eyes and lids as devout and modest as the Italian picture of the Madonna, while the lower part of the face has the simplicity and childish strength of the Indian race. Her picture presents the finest specimen of Indian beauty we have ever seen. Such a Woman is the sister and friend of all beings, as the worthy Man is their brother and helper.\n\nWith like pleasure we survey the pairs wedded on the eve of missionary effort They, indeed, are fellow-pilgrims on the well-made road, and whether or no they accomplish all they hope for the sad Hindoo, or the nearer savage, we feel that in the burning waste their love is like to be a healing dew, in the forlorn jungle a tent of solace to one another. They meet, as children of one Father, to read together one book of instruction.\n\nWe must insert in this connection the most beautiful picture presented by ancient literature of wedded love under this noble form.\n\nIt is from the romance in which Xenophon, the chivalrous Greek, presents his ideal of what human nature should be.\n\nThe generals of Cyrus had taken captive a princess, a woman of unequalled beauty, and hastened to present her to the prince as that part of the spoil he would think most worthy of his acceptance. Cyrus visits the lady, and is filled with immediate admiration by the modesty and majesty with which she receives him. He finds her name is Panthea, and that she is the wife of Abradatus, a young king whom she entirely loves. He protects her as a sister, in his camp, till he can restore her to her husband.\n\nAfter the first transports of joy at this reunion, the heart of Panthea is bent on showing her love and gratitude to her magnanimous and delicate protector. And as she has nothing so precious to give as the aid of Abradatus, that is what she most wishes to offer. Her husband is of one soul with her in this, as in all things.\n\nThe description of her grief and self-destruction, after the death which ensued upon this devotion, I have seen quoted, but never that of their parting when she sends him forth to battle. I shall copy both. If they have been read by any of my readers, they may be so again with profit in this connection, for never were the heroism of a true Woman, and the purity of love in a true marriage, painted in colors more delicate and more lively.\n\n\u201cThe chariot of Abradatus, that had four perches and eight horses, was completely adorned for him; and when he was going to put on his linen corslet, which was a sort of armor used by those of his country, Panthea brought him a golden helmet, and arm-pieces, broad bracelets for his wrists, a purple habit that reached down to his feet, and hung in folds at the bottom, and a crest dyed of a violet color. These things she had made, unknown to her husband, and by taking the measure of his armor. He wondered when he saw them, and inquired thus of Panthea: 'And have you made me these arms, woman, by destroying your own ornaments?' 'No, by Jove!' said Panthea, 'not what is the most valuable of them; for it is you, if you appear to others to be what I think you, that will be my greatest ornament.' And, saying that, she put on him the armor, and, though she endeavored to conceal it, the tears poured down her checks. When Abradatus, who was before a man of fine appearance, was set out in those arms, he appeared the most beautiful and noble of all, especially being likewise so by nature. Then, taking the reins from the driver, he was just preparing to mount the chariot, when Panthea, after she had desired all that were there to retire, thus said:\n\n\u201c'O Abradatus! if ever there was a woman who had a greater regard to her husband than to her own soul, I believe you know that I am such an one; what need I therefore speak of things in particular? for I reckon that my actions have convinced you more than any words I can now use. And yet, though I stand thus affected toward you, as you know I do, I swear, by this friendship of mine and yours, that I certainly would rather choose to be put under ground jointly with you, approving yourself a brave man, than to live with you in disgrace and shame; so much do I think you and myself worthy of the noblest things. Then I think that we both lie under great obligations to Cyrus, that, when I was a captive, and chosen out for himself, he thought fit to treat me neither as a slave, nor, indeed, as a woman of mean account, but he took and kept me for you, as if I were his brother's wife. Besides, when Araspes, who was my guard, went away from him, I promised him, that, if he would allow me to send for you, you would come to him, and approve yourself a much better and move faithful friend than Araspes.'\n\n\u201cThus she spoke; and Abradatus, being struck with admiration at her discourse, laying, his hand gently on her head, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, made this prayer: 'Do thou, O greatest Jove! I grant me to appear a husband worthy of Panthea, and a friend worthy of Cyrus, who has done us so much honor!'\n\n\u201cHaving said this, he mounted the chariot by the door of the driver's seat; and, after he had got up, when the driver shut the door, Panthea, who had now no other way to salute him, kissed the seat of the chariot. The chariot then moved, and she, unknown to him, followed, till Abradatus turning about, and seeing her, said: 'Take courage, Panthea! Fare you happily and well, and now go your ways.' On this her women and servants carried her to her conveyance, and, laying her down, concealed her by throwing the covering of a tent over her. The people, though Abradatus and his chariot made a noble spectacle, were not able to look at him till Panthea was gone.\u201d\n\nAfter the battle\u2014\n\n\u201cCyrus calling to some of his servants, 'Tell me, said he, 'has any one seen Abradatus? for I admire that he now does not appear.' One replied, 'My sovereign, it is because he is not living, but died in the battle as he broke in with his chariot on the Egyptians. All the rest, except his particular companions, they say, turned off when they saw the Egyptians' compact body. His wife is now said to have taken up his dead body, to have placed it in the carriage that she herself was conveyed in, and to have brought it hither to some place on the river Pactolus, and her servants are digging a grave on a certain elevation. They say that his wife, after setting him out with all the ornaments she has, is sitting on the ground with his head on her knees.' Cyrus, hearing this, gave himself a blow on the thigh, mounted his horse at a leap, and, taking with him a thousand horse, rode away to this scene of affliction; but gave orders to Gadatas and Gobryas to take with them all the rich ornaments proper for a friend and an excellent man deceased, and to follow after him; and whoever had herds of cattle with him, he ordered them to take both oxen, and horses, and sheep in good number, and to bring them away to the place where, by inquiry, they should find him to be, that he might sacrifice these to Abradatus.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he saw the woman sitting on the ground, and the dead body there lying, he shed tears at the afflicting sight, and said: 'Alas! thou brave and faithful soul, hast thou left us, and art thou gone?' At the same time he took him by the right hand, and the hand of the deceased came away, for it had been cut off with a sword by the Egyptians. He, at the sight of this, became yet much more concerned than before. The woman shrieked out in a lamentable manner, and, taking the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, fitted it to its proper place again, as well as she could, and said: 'The rest, Cyrus, is in the same condition, but what need you see it? And I know that I was not one of the least concerned in these his sufferings, and, perhaps, you were not less so; for I, fool that I was! frequently exhorted him to behave in such a manner as to appear a friend to you, worthy of notice; and I know he never thought of what he himself should suffer, but of what he should do to please you. He is dead, therefore,' said she, 'without reproach, and I, who urged him on, sit here alive.' Cyrus, shedding tears for some time in silence, then spoke:\u2014'He has died, woman, the noblest death; for he has died victorious! Do you adorn him with these things that I furnish you with.' (Gobryas and Gadatas were then come up, and had brought rich ornaments in great abundance with them.) 'Then,' said he, 'be assured that he shall not want respect and honor in all other things; but, over and above, multitudes shall concur in raising him a monument that shall be worthy of us, and all the sacrifices shall be made him that are proper to be made in honor of a brave man. You shall not be left destitute, but, for the sake of your modesty and every other virtue, I will pay you all other honors, as well as place those about you who will conduct you wherever you please. Do you but make it known to me where it is that you desire to be conveyed to.' And Panthea replied: 'Be confident, Cyrus, I will not conceal from you to whom it is that I desire to go.'\n\n\u201cHe, having said this, went away with great pity for her that she should have lost such a husband, and for the man that he should have left such a wife behind him, never to see her more. Panthea then gave orders for her servants to retire, 'till such time,' said she, 'as I shall have lamented my husband as I please.' Her nurse she bid to stay, and gave orders that, when she was dead, she would wrap her and her husband up in one mantle together. The nurse, after having repeatedly begged her not to do this, and meeting with no success, but observing her to grow angry, sat herself down, breaking out into tears. She, being beforehand provided with a sword, killed herself, and, laying her head down on her husband's breast, she died. The nurse set up a lamentable cry, and covered them both, as Panthea had directed.\n\n\u201cCyrus, as soon as he was informed of what the woman had done, being struck with it, went to help her if he could. The servants, three in number, seeing what had been done, drew their swords and killed themselves, as they stood at the place where she bad ordered them. And the monument is now said to have been raised by continuing the mound on to the servants; and on a pillar above, they say, the names of the man and woman were written in Syriac letters.\n\n\u201cBelow were three pillars, and they were inscribed thus, 'Of the servants.' Cyrus, when he came to this melancholy scene, was struck with admiration of the woman, and, having lamented over her, went away. He took care, as was proper, that all the funeral rites should be paid them in the noblest manner, and the monument, they say, was raised up to a very great size.\u201d\n\nThese be the ancients, who, so many assert, had no idea of the dignity of Woman, or of marriage. Such love Xenophon could paint as subsisting between those who after death \u201cwould see one another never more.\u201d Thousands of years have passed since, and with the reception of the Cross, the nations assume the belief that those who part thus may meet again and forever, if spiritually fitted to one another, as Abradatus and Panthea were, and yet do we see such marriages among them? If at all, how often?\n\nI must quote two more short passages from Xenophon, for he is a writer who pleases me well.\n\nCyrus, receiving the Armenians whom he had conquered\u2014\n\n\u201c'Tigranes,' said he, 'at what rate would you purchase the regaining of your wife?' Now Tigranes happened to be but lately married, and had a very great love for his wife.\u201d (That clause perhaps sounds modern.)\n\n\u201c'Cyrus,' said he, 'I would ransom her at the expense of my life.'\n\n\u201c'Take then your own to yourself,' said he. ...\n\n\u201cWhen they came home, one talked of Cyrus' wisdom, another of his patience and resolution, another of his mildness. One spoke of his beauty and smallness of his person, and, on that, Tigranes asked his wife, 'And do you, Armenian dame, think Cyrus handsome?' 'Truly,' said she, 'I did not look at him.' 'At whom, then, did you look?' said Tigranes. 'At him who said that, to save me from servitude, he would ransom me at the expense of his own life.'\u201c\n\nFrom the Banquet.\u2014\n\n\u201cSocrates, who observed her with pleasure, said, 'This young girl has confirmed me in the opinion I have had, for a long time, that the female sex are nothing inferior to ours, excepting only in strength of body, or, perhaps, his steadiness of judgment.'\u201c\n\nIn the Economics, the manner in which the husband gives counsel to his young wife presents the model of politeness and refinement. Xenophon is thoroughly the gentleman; gentle in breeding and in soul. All the men he describes are so, while the shades of manner are distinctly marked. There is the serene dignity of Socrates, with gleams of playfulness thrown across its cool, religious shades, the princely mildness of Cyrus, and the more domestic elegance of the husband in the Economics.\n\nThere is no way that men sin more against refinement, as well as discretion, than in their conduct toward their wives. Let them look at the men of Xenophon. Such would know how to give counsel, for they would know how to receive it. They would feel that the most intimate relations claimed most, not least, of refined courtesy. They would not suppose that confidence justified carelessness, nor the reality of affection want of delicacy in the expression of it.\n\nSuch men would be too wise to hide their affairs from the wife, and then expect her to act as if she knew them. They would know that, if she is expected to face calamity with courage, she must be instructed and trusted in prosperity, or, if they had failed in wise confidence, such as the husband shows in the Economics, they would be ashamed of anger or querulous surprise at the results that naturally follow.\n\nSuch men would not be exposed to the bad influence of bad wives; for all wives, bad or good, loved or unloved, inevitably influence their husbands, from the power their position not merely gives, but necessitates, of coloring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when the\u2014patient, shall I call him?\u2014is off his guard. Those who understand the wife's mind, and think it worth while to respect her springs of action, know bettor where they are. But to the bad or thoughtless man, who lives carelessly and irreverently so near another mind, the wrong he does daily back upon himself recoils. A Cyrus, an Abradatus, knows where he stands.\n\nBut to return to the thread of my subject.\n\nAnother sign of the times is furnished by the triumphs of Female Authorship. These have been great, and are constantly increasing. Women have taken possession of so many provinces for which men had pronounced them unfit, that, though these still declare there are some inaccessible to them, it is difficult to say just where they must stop.\n\nThe shining names of famous women have cast light upon the path of the sex, and many obstructions have been removed. When a Montague could learn better than her brother, and use her lore afterwards to such purpose as an observer, it seemed amiss to hinder women from preparing themselves to see, or from seeing all they could, when prepared. Since Somerville has achieved so much, will any young girl be prevented from seeking a knowledge of the physical sciences, if she wishes it? De Stael's name was not so clear of offence; she could not forget the Woman in the thought; while she was instructing you as a mind, she wished to be admired as a Woman; sentimental tears often dimmed the eagle glance. Her intellect, too, with all its splendor, trained in a drawing-room, fed on flattery, was tainted and flawed; yet its beams make the obscurest school-house in New England warmer and lighter to the little rugged girls who are gathered together on its wooden bench. They may never through life hear her name, but she is not the less their benefactress.\n\nThe influence has been such, that the aim certainly is, now, in arranging school instruction for girls, to give them as fair a field as boys. As yet, indeed, these arrangements are made with little judgment or reflection; just as the tutors of Lady Jane Grey, and other distinguished women of her time, taught them Latin and Greek, because they knew nothing else themselves, so now the improvement in the education of girls is to be made by giving them young men as teachers, who only teach what has been taught themselves at college, while methods and topics need revision for these new subjects, which could better be made by those who had experienced the same wants. Women are, often, at the head of these institutions; but they have, as yet, seldom been thinking women, capable of organizing a new whole for the wants of the time, and choosing persons to officiate in the departments. And when some portion of instruction of a good sort is got from the school, the far greater proportion which is infused from the general atmosphere of society contradicts its purport. Yet books and a little elementary instruction are not furnished in vain. Women are better aware how great and rich the universe is, not so easily blinded by narrowness or partial views of a home circle. \u201cHer mother did so before her\u201d is no longer a sufficient excuse. Indeed, it was never received as an excuse to mitigate the severity of censure, but was adduced as a reason, rather, why there should be no effort made for reformation.\n\nWhether much or little has been done, or will be done,\u2014whether women will add to the talent of narration the power of systematizing,\u2014whether they will carve marble, as well as draw and paint,\u2014is not important. But that it should be acknowledged that they have intellect which needs developing\u2014that they should not be considered complete, if beings of affection and habit alone\u2014is important.\n\nYet even this acknowledgment, rather conquered by Woman than proffered by Man, has been sullied by the usual selfishness. Too much is said of women being better educated, that they may become better companions and mothers for men. They should be fit for such companionship, and we have mentioned, with satisfaction, instances where it has been established. Earth knows no fairer, holier relation than that of a mother. It is one which, rightly understood, must both promote and require the highest attainments. But a being of infinite scope must not be treated with an exclusive view to any one relation. Give the soul free course, let the organization, both of body and mind, be freely developed, and the being will be fit for any and every relation to which it may be called. The intellect, no more than the sense of hearing, is to be cultivated merely that Woman may be a more valuable companion to Man, but because the Power who gave a power, by its mere existence signifies that it must be brought out toward perfection.\n\nIn this regard of self-dependence, and a greater simplicity and fulness of being, we must hail as a preliminary the increase of the class contemptuously designated as \u201cold maids.\u201d\n\nWe cannot wonder at the aversion with which old bachelors and old maids have been regarded. Marriage is the natural means of forming a sphere, of taking root in the earth; it requires more strength to do this without such an opening; very many have failed, and their imperfections have been in every one's way. They have been more partial, more harsh, more officious and impertinent, than those compelled by severer friction to render themselves endurable. Those who have a more full experience of the instincts have a distrust as to whether the unmarried can be thoroughly human and humane, such as is hinted in the saying, \u201cOld-maids' and bachelors' children are well cared for,\u201d which derides at once their ignorance and their presumption.\n\nYet the business of society has become so complex, that it could now scarcely be carried on without the presence of these despised auxiliaries; and detachments from the army of aunts and uncles are wanted to stop gaps in every hedge. They rove about, mental and moral Ishmaelites, pitching their tents amid the fixed and ornamented homes of men.\n\nIn a striking variety of forms, genius of late, both at home and abroad, has paid its tribute to the character of the Aunt and the Uncle, recognizing in these personages the spiritual parents, who have supplied defects in the treatment of the busy or careless actual parents.\n\nThey also gain a wider, if not so deep experience. Those who are not intimately and permanently linked with others, are thrown upon themselves; and, if they do not there find peace and incessant life, there is none to flatter them that they are not very poor, and very mean.\n\nA position which so constantly admonishes, may be of inestimable benefit. The person may gain, undistracted by other relationships, a closer communion with the one. Such a use is made of it by saints and sibyls. Or she may be one of the lay sisters of charity, a canoness, bound by an inward vow,\u2014or the useful drudge of all men, the Martha, much sought, little prized,\u2014or the intellectual interpreter of the varied life she sees; the Urania of a half-formed world's twilight.\n\nOr she may combine all these. Not needing to care that she may please a husband, a frail and limited being, her thoughts may turn to the centre, and she may, by steadfast contemplation entering into the secret of truth and love, use it for the good of all men, instead of a chosen few, and interpret through it all the forms of life. It is possible, perhaps, to be at once a priestly servant and a loving muse.\n\nSaints and geniuses have often chosen a lonely position, in the faith that if, undisturbed by the pressure of near ties, they would give themselves up to the inspiring spirit, it would enable them to understand and reproduce life better than actual experience could.\n\nHow many \u201cold maids\u201d take this high stand we cannot say: it is an unhappy fact that too many who have come before the eye are gossips rather, and not always good-natured gossips. But if these abuse, and none make the best of their vocation, yet it has not failed to produce some good results. It has been seen by others, if not by themselves, that beings, likely to be left alone, need to be fortified and furnished within themselves; and education and thought have tended more and more to regard these beings as related to absolute Being, as well as to others. It has been seen that, as the breaking of no bond ought to destroy a man, so ought the missing of none to hinder him from growing. And thus a circumstance of the time, which springs rather from its luxury than its purity, has helped to place women on the true platform.\n\nPerhaps the next generation, looking deeper into this matter, will find that contempt is put upon old maids, or old women, at all, merely because they do not use the elixir which would keep them always young. Under its influence, a gem brightens yearly which is only seen to more advantage through the fissures Time makes in the casket. [Footnote: Appendix F.] No one thinks of Michael Angelo's Persican Sibyl, or St. Theresa, or Tasso's Leonora, or the Greek Electra, as an old maid, more than of Michael Angelo or Canova as old bachelors, though all had reached the period in life's course appointed to take that degree.\n\nSee a common woman at forty; scarcely has she the remains of beauty, of any soft poetic grace which gave her attraction as Woman, which kindled the hearts of those who looked on her to sparkling thoughts, or diffused round her a roseate air of gentle love. See her, who was, indeed, a lovely girl, in the coarse, full-blown dahlia flower of what is commonly matron-beauty, \u201cfat, fair, and forty,\u201d showily dressed, and with manners as broad and full as her frill or satin cloak. People observe, \u201cHow well she is preserved!\u201d \u201cShe is a fine woman still,\u201d they say. This woman, whether as a duchess in diamonds, or one of our city dames in mosaics, charms the poet's heart no more, and would look much out of place kneeling before the Madonna. She \u201cdoes well the honors of her house,\u201d\u2014\u201dleads society,\u201d\u2014is, in short, always spoken and thought of upholstery-wise.\n\nOr see that care-worn face, from which every soft line is blotted,\u2014those faded eyes, from which lonely tears have driven the flashes of fancy, the mild white beam of a tender enthusiasm. This woman is not so ornamental to a tea-party; yet she would please better, in picture. Yet surely she, no more than the other, looks as a human being should at the end of forty years. Forty years! have they bound those brows with no garland? shed in the lamp no drop of ambrosial oil?\n\nNot so looked the Iphigenia in Aulis. Her forty years had seen her in anguish, in sacrifice, in utter loneliness. But those pains were borne for her father and her country; the sacrifice she had made pure for herself and those around her. Wandering alone at night in the vestal solitude of her imprisoning grove, she has looked up through its \u201cliving summits\u201d to the stars, which shed down into her aspect their own lofty melody. At forty she would not misbecome the marble.\n\nNot so looks the Persica. She is withered; she is faded; the drapery that enfolds her has in its dignity an angularity, too, that tells of age, of sorrow, of a stern resignation to the must. But her eye, that torch of the soul, is untamed, and, in the intensity of her reading, we see a soul invincibly young in faith and hope. Her age is her charm, for it is the night of the past that gives this beacon-fire leave to shine. Wither more and more, black Chrysalid! thou dost but give the winged beauty time to mature its splendors!\n\nNot so looked Victoria Colonna, after her life of a great hope, and of true conjugal fidelity. She had been, not merely a bride, but a wife, and each hour had helped to plume the noble bird. A coronet of pearls will not shame her brow; it is white and ample, a worthy altar for love and thought.\n\nEven among the North American Indians, a race of men as completely engaged in mere instinctive life as almost any in the world, and where each chief, keeping many wives as useful servants, of course looks with no kind eye on celibacy in Woman, it was excused in the following instance mentioned by Mrs. Jameson. A woman dreamt in youth that she was betrothed to the Sun. She built her a wigwam apart, filled it with emblems of her alliance, and means of on independent life. There she passed her days, sustained by her own exertions, and true to her supposed engagement.\n\nIn any tribe, we believe, a woman, who lived as if she was betrothed to the Sun, would be tolerated, and the rays which made her youth blossom sweetly, would crown her with a halo in age.\n\nThere is, on this subject, a nobler view than heretofore, if not the noblest, and improvement here must coincide with that in the view taken of marriage. \u201cWe must have units before we can have union,\u201d says one of the ripe thinkers of the times.\n\nIf larger intellectual resources begin to be deemed needful to Woman, still more is a spiritual dignity in her, or even the mere assumption of it, looked upon with respect. Joanna Southcote and Mother Anne Lee are sure of a band of disciples; Ecstatica, Dolorosa, of enraptured believers who will visit them in their lowly huts, and wait for days to revere them in their trances. The foreign noble traverses land and sea to hear a few words from the lips of the lowly peasant girl, whom he believes especially visited by the Most High. Very beautiful, in this way, was the influence of the invalid of St. Petersburg, as described by De Maistre.\n\nMysticism, which may be defined as the brooding soul of the world, cannot fail of its oracular promise as to Woman. \u201cThe mothers,\u201d \u201cThe mother of all things,\u201d are expressions of thought which lead the mind towards this side of universal growth. Whenever a mystical whisper was heard, from Behmen down to St. Simon, sprang up the thought, that, if it be true, as the legend says, that Humanity withers through a fault committed by and a curse laid upon Woman, through her pure child, or influence, shall the new Adam, the redemption, arise. Innocence is to be replaced by virtue, dependence by a willing submission, in the heart of the Virgin-Mother of the new race.\n\nThe spiritual tendency is toward the elevation of Woman, but the intellectual by itself is not so. Plato sometimes seems penetrated by that high idea of love, which considers Man and Woman as the two-fold expression of one thought. This the angel of Swedenborg, the angel of the coming age, cannot surpass, but only explain more fully. But then again Plato, the man of intellect, treats Woman in the Republic as property, and, in the Tim\u00e6us, says that Man, if he misuse the privileges of one life, shall be degraded into the form of Woman; and then, if ho do not redeem himself, into that of a bird. This, as I said above, expresses most happily how antipoetical is this state of mind. For the poet, contemplating the world of things, selects various birds as the symbols of his most gracious and ethereal thoughts, just as he calls upon his genius as muse rather than as God. But the intellect, cold, is ever more masculine than feminine; warmed by emotion, it rushes toward mother-earth, and puts on the forms of beauty.\n\nThe electrical, the magnetic element in Woman has not been fairly brought out at any period. Everything might be expected from it; she has far more of it than Man. This is commonly expressed by saying that her intuitions are more rapid and more correct. You will often see men of high intellect absolutely stupid in regard to the atmospheric changes, the fine invisible links which connect the forms of life around them, while common women, if pure and modest, so that a vulgar self do not overshadow the mental eye, will seize and delineate these with unerring discrimination.\n\nWomen who combine this organization with creative genius are very commonly unhappy at present. They see too much to act in conformity with those around them, and their quick impulses seem folly to those who do not discern the motives. This is an usual effect of the apparition of genius, whether in Man or Woman, but is more frequent with regard to the latter, because a harmony, an obvious order and self-restraining decorum, is most expected from her.\n\nThen women of genius, even more than men, are likely to be enslaved by an impassioned sensibility. The world repels them more rudely, and they are of weaker bodily frame.\n\nThose who seem overladen with electricity frighten those around them. \u201cWhen she merely enters the room, I am what the French call heriss\u00e9,\u201d said a man of petty feelings and worldly character of such a woman, whose depth of eye and powerful motion announced the conductor of the mysterious fluid.\n\nWoe to such a woman who finds herself linked to such a man in bonds too close! It is the crudest of errors. He will detest her with all the bitterness of wounded self-love. He will take the whole prejudice of manhood upon himself, and, to the utmost of his power, imprison and torture her by its imperious rigors.\n\nYet, allow room enough, and the electric fluid will be found to invigorate and embellish, not destroy life. Such women are the great actresses, the songsters. Such traits we read in a late searching, though too French, analysis of the character of Mademoiselle Rachel, by a modern, La Rochefeucault. The Greeks thus represent the muses; they have not the golden serenity of Apollo; they are overflowed with thought; there is something tragic in their air. Such are the Sibyls of Gueroino; the eye is overfull of expression, dilated and lustrous; it seems to have drawn the whole being into it.\n\nSickness is the frequent result of this overcharged existence. To this region, however misunderstood, or interpreted with presumptuous carelessness, belong the phenomena of magnetism, or mesmerism, as it is now often called, where the trance of the Ecstatica purports to be produced by the agency of one human being on another, instead of, as in her case, direct from the spirit.\n\nThe worldling has his sneer at this as at the services of religion. \u201cThe churches can always be filled with women\u201d\u2014\u201dShow me a man in one of your magnetic states, and I will believe.\u201d\n\nWomen are, indeed, the easy victims both of priestcraft and self-delusion; but this would not be, if the intellect was developed in proportion to the other powers. They would then have a regulator, and be more in equipoise, yet must retain the same nervous susceptibility while their physical structure is such as it is.\n\nIt is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to strengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides. When the intellect and affections are in harmony; when intellectual consciousness is calm and deep; inspiration will not be confounded with fancy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, \u201cshe who advances\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With rapturous, lyrical glances,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Singing the song of the earth, singing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its hymn to the Gods,\u201d\n\nwill not be pitied as a mad-woman, nor shrunk from as unnatural.\n\nThe Greeks, who saw everything in forms, which we are trying to ascertain as law, and classify as cause, embodied all this in the form of Cassandra. Cassandra was only unfortunate in receiving her gift too soon. The remarks, however, that the world still makes in such cases, are well expressed by the Greek dramatist.\n\nIn the Trojan dames there are fine touches of nature with regard to Cassandra. Hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that prosaic kindred always do toward the inspired child, the poet, the elected sufferer for the race.\n\nWhen the herald announces that Cassandra is chosen to be the mistress of Agamemnon, Hecuba answers, with indignation, betraying the pride and faith she involuntarily felt in this daughter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHec. The maiden of Phoebus, to whom the golden-haired\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gave as a privilege a virgin life!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tal. Love of the inspired maiden hath pierced him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hec. Then cast away, my child, the sacred keys, and from thy person\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consecrated garlands which thou wearest.\u201d\n\nYet, when, a moment after, Cassandra appears, singing, wildly, her inspired song, Hecuba calls her, \u201cMy frantic child.\u201d\n\nYet how graceful she is in her tragic raptus, the chorus shows.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChorus. How sweetly at thy house's ills thou smil'st,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chanting what, haply, thou wilt not show true.\u201d\n\nIf Hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter, still less can the vulgar mind of the herald Talthybius, a man not without feeling, but with no princely, no poetic blood, abide the wild, prophetic mood which insults all his prejudices.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTal. The venerable, and that accounted wise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is nothing better than that of no repute;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the greatest king of all the Greeks,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dear son of Atreus, a possessed with the love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of this mad-Woman. I, indeed, am poor;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet I would not receive her to my bed.\u201d\n\nThe royal Agamemnon could see the beauty of Cassandra; he was not afraid of her prophetic gifts.\n\nThe best topic for a chapter on this subject, in the present day, would be the history of the Seeress of Prevorst, the best observed subject of magnetism in our present times, and who, like her ancestresses of Delphos, was roused to ecstasy or phrensy by the touch of the laurel.\n\nI observe in her case, and in one known to me here, that what might have been a gradual and gentle disclosure of remarkable powers was broken and jarred into disease by an unsuitable marriage. Both these persons were unfortunate in not understanding what was involved in this relation, but acted ignorantly, as their friends desired. They thought that this was the inevitable destiny of Woman. But when engaged in the false position, it was impossible for them to endure its dissonances, as those of less delicate perceptions can; and the fine flow of life was checked and sullied. They grew sick; but, even so, learned and disclosed more than those in health are won't to do.\n\nIn such cases, worldlings sneer; but reverent men learn wondrous news, either from the person observed, or by thoughts caused in themselves by the observation. Fenelon learns from Guyon, Kerner from his Seeress, what we fain would know. But to appreciate such disclosures one must be a child; and here the phrase, \u201cwomen and children,\u201d may, perhaps, be interpreted aright, that only little children shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n\nAll these motions of the time, tides that betoken a waxing moon, overflow upon our land. The world at large is readier to let Woman learn and manifest the capacities of her nature than it ever was before, and here is a less encumbered field and freer air than anywhere else. And it ought to be so; we ought to pay for Isabella's jewels.\n\nThe names of nations are feminine\u2014Religion, Virtue and Victory are feminine. To those who have a superstition, as to outward reigns, it is not without significance that the name of the queen of our motherland should at this crisis be Victoria,\u2014Victoria the First. Perhaps to us it may be given to disclose the era thus outwardly presaged.\n\nAnother Isabella too at this time ascends the throne. Might she open a new world to her sex! But, probably, these poor little women are, least of any, educated to serve as examples or inspirers for the rest. The Spanish queen is younger; we know of her that she sprained her foot the other day, dancing in her private apartments; of Victoria, that she reads aloud, in a distinct voice and agreeable manner, her addresses to Parliament on certain solemn days, and, yearly, that she presents to the nation some new prop of royalty. These ladies have, very likely, been trained more completely to the puppet life than any other. The queens, who have been queens indeed, were trained by adverse circumstances to know the world around them and their own powers.\n\nIt is moving, while amusing, to read of the Scottish peasant measuring the print left by the queen's foot as she walks, and priding himself on its beauty. It is so natural to wish to find what is fair and precious in high places,\u2014so astonishing to find the Bourbon a glutton, or the Guelph a dullard or gossip.\n\nIn our own country, women are, in many respects, better situated than men. Good books are allowed, with more time to read them. They are not so early forced into the bustle of life, nor so weighed down by demands for outward success. The perpetual changes, incident to our society, make the blood circulate freely through the body politic, and, if not favorable at present to the grace and bloom of life, they are so to activity, resource, and would be to reflection, but for a low materialist tendency, from which the women are generally exempt in themselves, though its existence, among the men, has a tendency to repress their impulses and make them doubt their instincts, thus often paralyzing their action during the best years.\n\nBut they have time to think, and no traditions chain them, and few conventionalities, compared with what must be met in other nations. There is no reason why they should not discover that the secrets of nature are open, the revelations of the spirit waiting, for whoever will seek them. When the mind is once awakened to this consciousness, it will not be restrained by the habits of the past, but fly to seek the seeds of a heavenly future.\n\nTheir employments are more favorable to meditation than those of men.\n\nWoman is not addressed religiously here more than elsewhere. She is told that she should be worthy to be the mother of a Washington, or the companion of some good man.' But in many, many instances, she has already learned that all bribes have the same flaw; that truth and good are to be sought solely for their own sakes. And, already, an ideal sweetness floats over many forms, shines in many eyes.\n\nAlready deep questions are put by young girls on the great theme: What shall I do to enter upon the eternal life?\n\nMen are very courteous to them. They praise them often, check them seldom. There is chivalry in the feeling toward \u201cthe ladies,\u201d which gives them the best seats in the stage-coach, frequent admission, not only to lectures of all sorts, but to courts of justice, halls of legislature, reform conventions. The newspaper editor \u201cwould be better pleased that the Lady's Book should be filled up exclusively by ladies. It would then, indeed, be a true gem, worthy, to be presented by young men to the, mistress of their affections.\u201d Can gallantry go further?\n\nIn this country is venerated, wherever seen, the character which Goethe spoke of as an Ideal, which he saw actualized in his friend and patroness, the Grand Duchess Amelia: \u201cThe excellent woman is she, who, if the husband dies, can be a father to the children.\u201d And this, if read aright, tells a great deal.\n\nWomen who speak in public, if they have a moral power, such as has been felt from Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly,\u2014that is, if they speak for conscience' sake, to serve a cause which they hold sacred,\u2014invariably subdue the prejudices of their hearers, and excite an interest proportionate to the aversion with which it had been the purpose to regard them.\n\nA passage in a private letter so happily illustrates this, that it must be inserted here.\n\nAbby Kelly in the Town-House of \u2014\u2014.\n\n\u201cThe scene was not unheroic\u2014to see that woman, true to humanity and her own nature, a centre of rude eyes and tongues, even gentlemen feeling licensed to make part of a species of mob around a female out of her sphere. As she took her seat in the desk amid the great noise, and in the throng, full, like a wave, of something to ensue, I saw her humanity in a gentleness and unpretension, tenderly open to the sphere around her, and, had she not been supported by the power of the will of genuineness and principle, she would have failed. It led her to prayer, which, in Woman especially, is childlike; sensibility and will going to the side of God and looking up to him; and humanity was poured out in aspiration.\n\n\u201cShe acted like a gentle hero, with her mild decision and womanly calmness. All heroism is mild, and quiet, and gentle, for it is life and possession; and combativeness and firmness show a want of actualness. She is as earnest, fresh and simple, as when she first entered the crusade. I think she did much good, more than the men in her place could do, for Woman feels more as being and reproducing\u2014this brings the subject more into home relations. Men speak through, and mostly from intellect, and this addresses itself to that in others which is combative.\u201d\n\nNot easily shall we find elsewhere, or before this time, any written observations on the same subject, so delicate and profound.\n\nThe late Dr. Channing, whose enlarged and tender and religious nature shared every onward impulse of his tune, though his thoughts followed his wishes with a deliberative caution which belonged to his habits and temperament, was greatly interested in these expectations for women. His own treatment of them was absolutely and thoroughly religious. He regarded them as souls, each of which had a destiny of its own, incalculable to other minds, and whose leading it must follow, guided by the light of a private conscience. He had sentiment, delicacy, kindness, taste; but they were all pervaded and ruled by this one thought, that all beings had souls, and must vindicate their own inheritance. Thus all beings were treated by him with an equal, and sweet, though solemn, courtesy. The young and unknown, the woman and the child, all felt themselves regarded with an infinite expectation, from which there was no reaction to vulgar prejudice. He demanded of all he met, to use his favorite phrase, \u201cgreat truths.\u201d\n\nHis memory, every way dear and reverend, is, by many, especially cherished for this intercourse of unbroken respect.\n\nAt one time, when the progress of Harriet Martineau through this country, Angelina Grimke's appearance in public, and the visit of Mrs. Jameson, had turned his thoughts to this subject, he expressed high hopes as to what the coming era would bring to Woman. He had been much pleased with the dignified courage of Mrs. Jameson in taking up the defence of her sex in from which women usually shrink, because, if they express themselves on such subjects with sufficient force and clearness to do any good, they are exposed to assaults whose vulgarity makes them painful. In intercourse with such a woman, he had shared her indignation at the base injustice, in many respects, and in many regions, done to the sex; and been led to think of it far more than ever before. He seemed to think that he might some time write upon the subject. That his aid is withdrawn from the cause is a subject of great regret; for, on this question as on others, he would have known how to sum up the evidence, and take, in the noblest spirit, middle ground. He always furnished a platform on which opposing parties could stand and look at one another under the influence of his mildness and enlightened candor.\n\nTwo younger thinkers, men both, have uttered noble prophecies, auspicious for Woman. Kinmont, all whose thoughts tended towards the establishment of the reign of love and peace, thought that the inevitable means of this would be an increased predominance given to the idea of Woman. Had he lived longer, to see the growth of the Peace Party, the reforms in life and medical practice which seek to substitute water for wine and drugs, pulse for animal food, he would have been confirmed in his view of the way in which the desired changes are to be effected.\n\nIn this connection I must mention Shelley, who, like all men of genius, shared the feminine development, and, unlike many, knew it. His life was one of the first pulse-beats in the present reform-growth. He, too, abhorred blood and heat, and, by his system and his song, tended to reinstate a plant-like gentleness in the development of energy. In harmony with this, his ideas of marriage were lofty, and, of course, no less so of Woman, her nature, and destiny.\n\nFor Woman, if, by a sympathy as to outward condition, she is led to aid the enfranchisement of the slave, must be no less so, by inward tendency, to favor measures which promise to bring the world more thoroughly and deeply into harmony with her nature. When the lamb takes place of the lion as the emblem of nations, both women and men will be as children of one spirit, perpetual learners of the word and doers thereof, not hearers only.\n\nA writer in the New York Pathfinder, in two articles headed \u201cFemality,\u201d has uttered a still more pregnant word than any we have named. He views Woman truly from the soul, and not from society, and the depth and leading of his thoughts are proportionably remarkable. He views the feminine nature as a harmonizer of the vehement elements, and this has often been hinted elsewhere; but what he expresses most forcibly is the lyrical, the inspiring and inspired apprehensiveness of her being.\n\nThis view being identical with what I have before attempted to indicate, as to her superior susceptibility to magnetic or electric influence, I will now try to express myself more fully.\n\nThere are two aspects of Woman's nature, represented by the ancients as Muse and Minerva. It is the former to which the writer in the Pathfinder looks. It is the latter which Wordsworth has in mind, when he says,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith a placid brow,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which woman ne'er should forfeit, keep thy vow.\u201d\n\nThe especial genius of Woman I believe to be electrical in movement, intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency. She excels not so easily in classification, or recreation, as in an instinctive seizure of causes, and a simple breathing out of what she receives, that has the singleness of life, rather than the selecting and energizing of art.\n\nMore native is it to her to be the living model of the artist than to set apart from herself any one form in objective reality; more native to inspire and receive the poem, than to create it. In so far as soul is in her completely developed, all soul is the same, but in so far as it is modified in her as Woman, it flows, it breathes, it sings, rather than deposits soil, or finishes work; and that which is especially feminine flushes, in blossom, the face of earth, and pervades, like air and water, all this seeming solid globe, daily renewing and purifying its life. Such may be the especially feminine element spoken of as Femality. But it is no more the order of nature that it should be incarnated pure in any form, than that the masculine energy should exist unmingled with it in any form.\n\nMale and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But, in fact, they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman.\n\nHistory jeers at the attempts of physiologists to bind great original laws by the forms which flow from them. They make a rule; they say from observation what can and cannot be. In vain! Nature provides exceptions to every rule. She sends women to battle, and sets Hercules spinning; she enables women to bear immense burdens, cold, and frost; she enables the man, who feels maternal love, to nourish his infant like a mother. Of late she plays still gayer pranks. Not only she deprives organizations, but organs, of a necessary end. She enables people to read with the top of the head, and see with the pit of the stomach. Presently she will make a female Newton, and a male Syren.\n\nMan partakes of the feminine in the Apollo, Woman of the masculine as Minerva.\n\nWhat I mean by the Muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive powers, which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of the higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being. It may appear as prophecy or as poesy. It enabled Cassandra to foresee the results of actions passing round her; the Seeress to behold the true character of the person through the mask of his customary life. (Sometimes she saw a feminine form behind the man, sometimes the reverse.) It enabled the daughter of Linn\u00e6us to see the soul of the flower exhaling from the flower. [Footnote: The daughter of Linnaeus states, that, while looking steadfastly at the red lily, she saw its spirit hovering above it, as a red flame. It is true, this, like many fair spirit-stories, may be explained away as an optical illusion, but its poetic beauty and meaning would, even then, make it valuable, as an illustration of the spiritual fact.] It gave a man, but a poet-man, the power of which he thus speaks: \u201cOften in my contemplation of nature, radiant intimations, and as it were sheaves of light, appear before me as to the facts of cosmogony, in which my mind has, perhaps, taken especial part.\u201d He wisely adds, \u201cbut it is necessary with earnestness to verify the knowledge we gain by these flashes of light.\u201d And none should forget this. Sight must be verified by light before it can deserve the honors of piety and genius. Yet sight comes first, and of this sight of the world of causes, this approximation to the region of primitive motions, women I hold to be especially capable. Even without equal freedom with the other sex, they have already shown themselves so; and should these faculties have free play, I believe they will open new, deeper and purer sources of joyous inspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth.\n\nLet us be wise, and not impede the soul. Let her work as she will. Let us have one creative energy, one incessant revelation. Let it take what form it will, and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman, black or white. Jove sprang from Rhea, Pallas from Jove. So let it be.\n\nIf it has been the tendency of these remarks to call Woman rather to the Minerva side,\u2014if I, unlike the more generous writer, have spoken from society no less than the soul,\u2014let it be pardoned! It is love that has caused this,\u2014love for many incarcerated souls, that might be freed, could the idea of religious self-dependence be established in them, could the weakening habit of dependence on others be broken up.\n\nProclus teaches that every life has, in its sphere, a totality or wholeness of the animating powers of the other spheres; having only, as its own characteristic, a predominance of some one power. Thus Jupiter comprises, within himself, the other twelve powers, which stand thus: The first triad is demiurgic or fabricative, that is, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan; the second, defensive, Vesta, Minerva, Mars; the third, vivific, Ceres, Juno, Diana; and the fourth, Mercury, Venus, Apollo, elevating and harmonic. In the sphere of Jupiter, energy is predominant\u2014with Venus, beauty; but each comprehends and apprehends all the others.\n\nWhen the same community of life and consciousness of mind begin among men, humanity will have, positively and finally, subjugated its brute elements and Titanic childhood; criticism will have perished; arbitrary limits and ignorant censure be impossible; all will have entered upon the liberty of law, and the harmony of common growth.\n\nThen Apollo will sing to his lyre what Vulcan forges on the anvil, and the Muse weave anew the tapestries of Minerva.\n\nIt is, therefore, only in the present crisis that the preference is given to Minerva. The power of continence must establish the legitimacy of freedom, the power of self-poise the perfection of motion.\n\nEvery relation, every gradation of nature is incalculably precious, but only to the soul which is poised upon itself, and to whom no loss, no change, can bring dull discord, for it is in harmony with the central soul.\n\nIf any individual live too much in relations, so that he becomes a stranger to the resources of his own nature, he falls, after a while, into a distraction, or imbecility, from which he can only be cured by a time of isolation, which gives the renovating fountains time to rise up. With a society it is the same. Many minds, deprived of the traditionary or instinctive means of passing a cheerful existence, must find help in self-impulse, or perish. It is therefore that, while any elevation, in the view of union, is to be hailed with joy, we shall not decline celibacy as the great fact of the time. It is one from which no vow, no arrangement, can at present save a thinking mind. For now the rowers are pausing on their oars; they wait a change before they can pull together. All tends to illustrate the thought of a wise cotemporary. Union is only possible to those who are units. To be fit for relations in time, souls, whether of Man or Woman, must be able to do without them in the spirit.\n\nIt is therefore that I would have Woman lay aside all thought, such as she habitually cherishes, of being taught and led by men. I would have her, like the Indian girl, dedicate herself to the Sun, the Sun of Truth, and go nowhere if his beams did not make clear the path. I would have her free from compromise, from complaisance, from helplessness, because I would have her good enough and strong enough to love one and all beings, from the fulness, not the poverty of being.\n\nMen, as at present instructed, will not help this work, because they also are under the slavery of habit. I have seen with delight their poetic impulses. A sister is the fairest ideal, and how nobly Wordsworth, and even Byron, have written of a sister!\n\nThere is no sweeter sight than to see a father with his little daughter. Very vulgar men become refined to the eye when leading a little girl by the hand. At that moment, the right relation between the sexes seems established, and you feel as if the man would aid in the noblest purpose, if you ask him in behalf of his little daughter. Once, two fine figures stood before me, thus. The father of very intellectual aspect, his falcon eye softened by affection as he looked down on his fair child; she the image of himself, only more graceful and brilliant in expression. I was reminded of Southey's Kehama; when, lo, the dream was rudely broken! They were talking of education, and he said,\n\n\u201cI shall not have Maria brought too forward. If she knows too much, she will never find a husband; superior women hardly ever can.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said his wife, with a blush, \u201cyou wish Maria to be as good and wise as she can, whether it will help her to marriage or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he persisted, \u201cI want her to have a sphere and a home, and some one to protect her when I am gone.\u201d\n\nIt was a trifling incident, but made a deep impression. I felt that the holiest relations fail to instruct the unprepared and perverted mind. If this man, indeed, could have looked at it on the other side, he was the last that would have been willing to have been taken himself for the home and protection he could give, but would have been much more likely to repeat the tale of Alcibiades with his phials.\n\nBut men do not look at both sides, and women must leave off asking them and being influenced by them, but retire within themselves, and explore the ground-work of life till they find their peculiar secret. Then, when they come forth again, renovated and baptized, they will know how to turn all dross to gold, and will be rich and free though they live in a hut, tranquil if in a crowd. Then their sweet singing shall not be from passionate impulse, but the lyrical overflow of a divine rapture, and a new music shall be evolved from this many-chorded world.\n\nGrant her, then, for a while, the armor and the javelin. Let her put from her the press of other minds, and meditate in virgin loneliness. The same idea shall reappear in due time as Muse, or Ceres, the all-kindly, patient Earth-Spirit.\n\nAmong the throng of symptoms which denote the present tendency to a crisis in the life of Woman,\u2014which resembles the change from girlhood, with its beautiful instincts, but unharmonized thoughts, its blind pupilage and restless seeking, to self-possessed, wise and graceful womanhood,\u2014I have attempted to select a few.\n\nOne of prominent interest is the unison upon the subject of three male minds, which, for width of culture, power of self-concentration and dignity of aim, take rank as the prophets of the coming age, while their histories and labors are rooted in the past.\n\nSwedenborg came, he tells us, to interpret the past revelation and unfold a new. He announces the New Church that is to prepare the way for the New Jerusalem, a city built of precious stones, hardened and purified by secret processes in the veins of earth through the ages.\n\nSwedenborg approximated to that harmony between the scientific and poetic lives of mind, which we hope from the perfected man. The links that bind together the realms of nature, the mysteries that accompany her births and growths, were unusually plain to him. He seems a man to whom insight was given at a period when the mental frame was sufficiently matured to retain and express its gifts.\n\nHis views of Woman are, in the main, satisfactory. In some details we my object to them, as, in all his system, there are still remains of what is arbitrary and seemingly groundless\u2014fancies that show the marks of old habits, and a nature as yet not thoroughly leavened with the spiritual leaven. At least, so it seems to me now. I speak reverently, for I find such reason to venerate Swedenborg, from an imperfect knowledge of his mind, that I feel one more perfect might explain to me much that does not now secure my sympathy.\n\nHis idea of Woman is sufficiently large and noble to interpose no obstacle to her progress. His idea of marriage is consequently sufficient. Man and Woman share an angelic ministry; the union is of one with one, permanent and pure.\n\nAs the New Church extends its ranks, the needs of Woman must be more considered.\n\nQuakerism also establishes Woman on a sufficient equality with Man. But, though the original thought of Quakerism is pure, its scope is too narrow, and its influence, having established a certain amount of good and made clear some truth, must, by degrees, be merged in one of wider range. [Footnote: In worship at stated periods, in daily expression, whether by word or deed, the Quakers have placed Woman on the same platform with Man. Can any one assert that they have reason to repent this?] The mind of Swedenborg appeals to the various nature of Man, and allows room for aesthetic culture and the free expression of energy.\n\nAs apostle of the new order, of the social fabric that is to rise from love, and supersede the old that was based on strife, Charles Fourier comes next, expressing, in an outward order, many facts of which Swedenborg saw the secret springs. The mind of Fourier, though grand and clear, was, in some respects, superficial. He was a stranger to the highest experiences. His eye was fixed on the outward more than the inward needs of Man. Yet he, too, was a seer of the divine order, in its musical expression, if not in its poetic soul. He has filled one department of instruction for the new era, and the harmony in action, and freedom for individual growth, he hopes, shall exist; and, if the methods he proposes should not prove the true ones, yet his fair propositions shall give many hints, and make room for the inspiration needed for such.\n\nHe, too, places Woman on an entire equality with Man, and wishes to give to one as to the other that independence which must result from intellectual and practical development.\n\nThose who will consult him for no other reason, might do so to see how the energies of Woman may be made available in the pecuniary way. The object of Fourier was to give her the needed means of self-help, that she might dignify and unfold her life for her own happiness, and that of society. The many, now, who see their daughters liable to destitution, or vice to escape from it, may be interested to examine the means, if they have not yet soul enough to appreciate the ends he proposes.\n\nOn the opposite side of the advancing army leads the great apostle of individual culture, Goethe. Swedenborg makes organization and union the necessary results of solitary thought. Fourier, whose nature was, above all, constructive, looked to them too exclusively. Better institutions, he thought, will make better men. Goethe expressed, in every way, the other side. If one man could present better forms, the rest could not use them till ripe for them.\n\nFourier says, As the institutions, so the men! All follies are excusable and natural under bad institutions.\n\nGoethe thinks, As the man, so the institutions! There is no excuse for ignorance and folly. A man can grow in any place, if he will.\n\nAy! but, Goethe, bad institutions are prison-walls and impure air, that make him stupid, so that he does not will.\n\nAnd thou, Fourier, do not expect to change mankind at once, or even \u201cin three generations,\u201d by arrangement of groups and series, or flourish of trumpets for attractive industry. If these attempts are made by unready men, they will fail.\n\nYet we prize the theory of Fourier no less than the profound suggestion of Goethe. Both are educating the age to a clearer consciousness of what Man needs, what Man can be; and better life must ensue.\n\nGoethe, proceeding on his own track, elevating the human being, in the most imperfect states of society, by continual efforts at self-culture, takes as good care of women as of men. His mother, the bold, gay Frau Aja, with such playful freedom of nature; the wise and gentle maiden, known in his youth, over whose sickly solitude \u201cthe Holy Ghost brooded as a dove;\u201d his sister, the intellectual woman par excellence; the Duchess Amelia; Lili, who combined the character of the woman of the world with the lyrical sweetness of the shepherdess, on whose chaste and noble breast flowers and gems were equally at home; all these had supplied abundant suggestions to his mind, as to the wants and the possible excellences of Woman. And from his poetic soul grew up forms new and more admirable than life has yet produced, for whom his clear eye marked out paths in the future.\n\nIn Faust Margaret represents the redeeming power, which, at present, upholds Woman, while waiting for a better day. The lovely little girl, pure in instinct, ignorant in mind, is misled and profaned by man abusing her confidence.[Footnote: As Faust says, her only fault was a \u201ckindly delusion,\u201d\u2014\u201dein guter wahn.\u201d] To the Mater Dolorosa she appeals for aid. It is given to the soul, if not against outward sorrow; and the maiden, enlightened by her sufferings, refusing to receive temporal salvation by the aid of an evil power, obtains the eternal in its stead.\n\nIn the second part, the intellectual man, after all his manifold strivings, owes to the interposition of her whom he had betrayed his salvation. She intercedes, this time, herself a glorified spirit, with the Mater Gloriosa.\n\nLeonora, too, is Woman, as we see her now, pure, thoughtful, refined by much acquaintance with grief.\n\nIphigenia he speaks of in his journals as his \u201cdaughter,\u201d and she is the daughter [Footnote: Goethe was as false to his ideas, in practice, as Lord Herbert. And his punishment was the just and usual one of connections formed beneath the standard of right, from the impulses of the baser self. Iphigenia was the worthy daughter of his mind; but the son, child of his degrading connection in actual life, corresponded with that connection. This son, on whom Goethe vainly lavished so much thought and care, was like his mother, and like Goethe's attachment for his mother. \u201cThis young man,\u201d says a late well-informed writer (M. Henri Blaze), \u201cWieland, with good reason, called the son of the servant, der Sohn der Magd. He inherited from his father only his name and his physique.\u201d] whom a man will wish, even if he has chosen his wife from very mean motives. She is the virgin, steadfast, soul, to whom falsehood is more dreadful than any other death.\n\nBut it is to Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Wandering Years that I would especially refer, as these volumes contain the sum of the Sage's observations during a long life, as to what Man should do, under present circumstances, to obtain mastery over outward, through an initiation into inward life, and severe discipline of faculty.\n\nAs Wilhelm advances into the upward path, he becomes acquainted with better forms of Woman, by knowing how to seek, and how to prize them when found. For the weak and immature man will, often, admire a superior woman, but he will not be able to abide by a feeling which is too severe a tax on his habitual existence. But, with Wilhelm, the gradation is natural, and expresses ascent in the scale of being. At first, he finds charm in Mariana and Philina, very common forms of feminine character, not without redeeming traits, no less than charms, but without wisdom or purity. Soon he is attended by Mignon, the finest expression ever yet given to what I have called the lyrical element in Woman. She is a child, but too full-grown for this man; he loves, but cannot follow her; yet is the association not without an enduring influence. Poesy has been domesticated in his life; and, though he strives to bind down her heavenward impulse, as art or apothegm, these are only the tents, beneath which he may sojourn for a while, but which may be easily struck, and carried on limitless wanderings.\n\nAdvancing into the region of thought, he encounters a wise philanthropy in Natalia (instructed, let us observe, by an uncle); practical judgment and the outward economy of life in Theresa; pure devotion in the Fair Saint.\n\nFurther, and last, he comes to the house of Macaria, the soul of a star; that is, a pure and perfected intelligence embodied in feminine form, and the centre of a world whose members revolve harmoniously around her. She instructs him in the archives of a rich human history, and introduces him to the contemplation of the heavens.\n\nFrom the hours passed by the side of Mariana to these with Macaria, is a wide distance for human feet to traverse. Nor has Wilhelm travelled so far, seen and suffered so much, in vain, He now begins to study how he may aid the next generation; he sees objects in harmonious arrangement, and from his observations deduces precepts by which to guide his course as a teacher and a master, \u201chelp-full, comfort-full.\u201d\n\nIn all these expressions of Woman, the aim of Goethe is satisfactory to me. He aims at a pure self-subsistence, and a free development of any powers with which they may be gifted by nature as much for them as for men. They are units, addressed as souls. Accordingly, the meeting between Man and Woman, as represented by him, is equal and noble; and, if he does not depict marriage, he makes it possible.\n\nIn the Macaria, bound with the heavenly bodies in fixed revolutions, the centre of all relations, herself unrelated, he expresses the Minerva side of feminine nature. It was not by chance that Goethe gave her this name. Macaria, the daughter of Hercules, who offered herself as a victim for the good of her country, was canonized by the Greeks, and worshipped as the Goddess of true Felicity. Goethe has embodied this Felicity as the Serenity that arises from Wisdom, a Wisdom such as the Jewish wise man venerated, alike instructed in the designs of heaven, and the methods necessary to carry them into effect upon earth.\n\nMignon is the electrical, inspired, lyrical nature. And wherever it appears we echo in our aspirations that of the child,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo let me seem until I be:\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take not the white robe away.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * * * *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThough I lived without care and toil,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet felt I sharp pain enough to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make me again forever young.\u201d\n\nAll these women, though we see them in relations, we can think of as unrelated. They all are very individual, yet seem nowhere restrained. They satisfy for the present, yet arouse an infinite expectation.\n\nThe economist Theresa, the benevolent Natalia, the fair Saint, have chosen a path, but their thoughts are not narrowed to it. The functions of life to them are not ends, but suggestions.\n\nThus, to them, all things are important, because none is necessary. Their different characters have fair play, and each is beautiful in its minute indications, for nothing is enforced or conventional; but everything, however slight, grows from the essential life of the being.\n\nMignon and Theresa wear male attire when they like, and it is graceful for them to do so, while Macaria is confined to her arm-chair behind the green curtain, and the Fair Saint could not bear a speck of dust on her robe.\n\nAll things are in their places in this little world, because all is natural and free, just as \u201cthere is room for everything out of doors.\u201d Yet all is rounded in by natural harmony, which will always arise where Truth and Love are sought in the light of Freedom.\n\nGoethe's book bodes an era of freedom like its own of \u201cextraordinary, generous seeking,\u201d and new revelations. New individualities shall be developed in the actual world, which shall advance upon it as gently as the figures come out upon his canvas.\n\nI have indicated on this point the coincidence between his hopes and those of Fourier, though his are directed by an infinitely higher and deeper knowledge of human nature. But, for our present purpose, it is sufficient to show how surely these different paths have conducted to the same end two earnest thinkers. In some other place I wish to point out similar coincidences between Goethe's model school and the plans of Fourier, which may cast light upon the page of prophecy.\n\nMany women have observed that the time drew nigh for a better care of the sex, and have thrown out hints that may be useful. Among these may be mentioned\u2014\n\nMiss Edgeworth, who, although restrained by the habits of her age and country, and belonging more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth century, has done excellently as far as she goes. She had a horror of sentimentalism, and of the love of notoriety, and saw how likely women, in the early stages of culture, were to aim at these. Therefore she bent her efforts to recommending domestic life. But the methods she recommends are such as will fit a character for any position to which it may be called. She taught a contempt of falsehood, no less in its most graceful, than in its meanest apparitions; the cultivation of a clear, independent judgment, and adherence to its dictates; habits of various and liberal study and employment, and a capacity for friendship. Her standard of character is the same for both sexes,\u2014Truth, honor, enlightened benevolence, and aspiration after knowledge. Of poetry, she knows nothing, and her religion consists in honor and loyalty to obligations once assumed\u2014in short, in \u201cthe great idea of duty which holds us upright.\u201d Her whole tendency is practical.\n\nMrs. Jameson is a sentimentalist, and, therefore, suits us ill in some respects, but she is full of talent, has a just and refined perception of the beautiful, and a genuine courage when she finds it necessary. She does not appear to have thought out, thoroughly, the subject on which we are engaged, and her opinions, expressed as opinions, are sometimes inconsistent with one another. But from the refined perception of character, admirable suggestions are given in her \u201cWomen of Shakspeare,\u201d and \u201cLoves of the Poets.\u201d\n\nBut that for which I most respect her is the decision with which she speaks on a subject which refined women are usually afraid to approach, for fear of the insult and scurrile jest they may encounter; but on which she neither can nor will restrain the indignation of a full heart. I refer to the degradation of a large portion of women into the sold and polluted slaves of men, and the daring with which the legislator and man of the world lifts his head beneath the heavens, and says, \u201cThis must be; it cannot be helped; it is a necessary accompaniment of civilization.\u201d\n\nSo speaks the citizen. Man born of Woman, the father of daughters, declares that he will and must buy the comforts and commercial advantages of his London, Vienna, Paris, New York, by conniving at the moral death, the damnation, so far as the action of society can insure it, of thousands of women for each splendid metropolis.\n\nO men! I speak not to you. It is true that your wickedness (for you must not deny that at least nine thousand out of the ten fall through the vanity you have systematically flattered, or the promises you have treacherously broken); yes, it is true that your wickedness is its own punishment. Your forms degraded and your eyes clouded by secret sin; natural harmony broken and fineness of perception destroyed in your mental and bodily organization; God and love shut out from your hearts by the foul visitants you have permitted there; incapable of pure marriage; incapable of pure parentage; incapable of worship; O wretched men, your sin is its own punishment! You have lost the world in losing yourselves. Who ruins another has admitted the worm to the root of his own tree, and the fuller ye fill the cup of evil, the deeper must be your own bitter draught. But I speak not to you\u2014you need to teach and warn one another. And more than one voice rises in earnestness. And all that women say to the heart that has once chosen the evil path is considered prudery, or ignorance, or perhaps a feebleness of nature which exempts from similar temptations.\n\nBut to you, women, American women, a few words may not be addressed in vain. One here and there may listen.\n\nYou know how it was in the Oriental clime, One man, if wealth permitted, had several wives and many handmaidens. The chastity and equality of genuine marriage, with \u201cthe thousand decencies that flow\u201d from its communion, the precious virtues that gradually may be matured within its enclosure, were unknown.\n\nBut this man did not wrong according to his light. What he did, he might publish to God and Man; it was not a wicked secret that hid in vile lurking-places and dens, like the banquets of beasts of prey. Those women were not lost, not polluted in their own eyes, nor those of others. If they were not in a state of knowledge and virtue, they were at least in one of comparative innocence.\n\nYou know how it was with the natives of this continent. A chief had many wives, whom he maintained and who did his household work; those women were but servants, still they enjoyed the respect of others and their own. They lived together, in peace. They knew that a sin against what was in their nation esteemed virtue, would be as strictly punished in Man as in Woman.\n\nNow pass to the countries where marriage is between one and one. I will not speak of the Pagan nations, but come to those which own the Christian rule. We all know what that enjoins; there is a standard to appeal to.\n\nSee, now, not the mass of the people, for we all know that it is a proverb and a bitter jest to speak of the \u201cdown-trodden million.\u201d We know that, down to our own time, a principle never had so fair a chance to pervade the mass of the people, but that we must solicit its illustration from select examples.\n\nTake the Paladin, take the Poet. Did they believe purity more impossible to Man than to Woman? Did they wish Woman to believe that Man was less amenable to higher motives,\u2014that pure aspirations would not guard him against bad passions,\u2014that honorable employments and temperate habits would not keep him free from slavery to the body? O no! Love was to them a part of heaven, and they could not even wish to receive its happiness, unless assured of being worthy of it. Its highest happiness to them was that it made them wish to be worthy. They courted probation. They wished not the title of knight till the banner had been upheld in the heats of battle, amid the rout of cowards.\n\nI ask of you, young girls\u2014I do not mean you whose heart is that of an old coxcomb, though your looks have not yet lost their sunny tinge. Not of you whose whole character is tainted with vanity, inherited or taught, who have early learned the love of coquettish excitement, and whose eyes rove restlessly in search of a \u201cconquest\u201d or a \u201cbeau;\u201d you who are ashamed not to be seen by others the mark of the most contemptuous flattery or injurious desire. To such I do not speak. But to thee, maiden, who, if not so fair, art yet of that unpolluted nature which Milton saw when he dreamed of Comus and the Paradise. Thou, child of an unprofaned wedlock, brought up amid the teachings of the woods and fields, kept fancy-free by useful employment and a free flight into the heaven of thought, loving to please only those whom thou wouldst not be ashamed to love; I ask of thee, whose cheek has not forgotten its blush nor thy heart its lark-like hopes, if he whom thou mayest hope the Father will send thee, as the companion of life's toils and joys, is not to thy thought pure? Is not manliness to thy thought purity, not lawlessness? Can his lips speak falsely? Can he do, in secret, what he could not avow to the mother that bore him? O say, dost thou not look for a heart free, open as thine own, all whose thoughts may be avowed, incapable of wronging the innocent, or still further degrading the fallen\u2014a man, in short, in whom brute nature is entirely subject to the impulses of his better self?\n\nYes! it was thus that thou didst hope; for I have many, many times seen the image of a future life, of a destined spouse, painted on the tablets of a virgin heart.\n\nIt might be that she was not true to these hopes. She was taken into what is called \u201cthe world,\u201d froth and scum as it mostly is on the social caldron. There, she saw fair Woman carried in the waltz close to the heart of a being who appeared to her a Satyr. Being warned by a male friend that he was in fact of that class, and not fit for such familiar nearness to a chaste being, the advised replied that \u201cwomen should know nothing about such things.\u201d She saw one fairer given in wedlock to a man of the same class. \u201cPapa and mamma said that 'all men were faulty at some time in their lives; they had a great many temptations.' Frederick would be so happy at home; he would not want to do wrong.\u201d She turned to the married women; they, O tenfold horror! laughed at her supposing \u201cmen were like women.\u201d Sometimes, I say, she was not true, and either sadly accommodated herself to \u201cWoman's lot,\u201d or acquired a taste for satyr-society, like some of the Nymphs, and all the Bacchanals of old. But to those who could not and would not accept a mess of pottage, or a Circe cup, in lieu of their birthright, and to these others who have yet their choice to make, I say, Courage! I have some words of cheer for you. A man, himself of unbroken purity, reported to me the words of a foreign artist, that \u201cthe world would never be better till men subjected themselves to the same laws they had imposed on women;\u201d that artist, he added, was true to the thought. The same was true of Canova, the same of Beethoven. \u201cLike each other demi-god, they kept themselves free from stain;\u201d and Michael Angelo, looking over here from the loneliness of his century, might meet some eyes that need not shun his glance.\n\nIn private life, I am assured by men who are not so sustained and occupied by the worship of pure beauty, that a similar consecration is possible, is practised; that many men feel that no temptation can be too strong for the will of man, if he invokes the aid of the Spirit instead of seeking extenuation from the brute alliances of his nature. In short, what the child fancies is really true, though almost the whole world declares it a lie. Man is a child of God; and if he seeks His guidance to keep the heart with diligence, it will be so given that all the issues of life may be pure. Life will then be a temple.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The temple round\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spread green the pleasant ground;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fair colonnade\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be of pure marble pillars made;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strong to sustain the roof,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time and tempest proof;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet, amidst which, the lightest breeze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can play as it please;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The audience hall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be free to all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who revere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power worshipped here,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sole guide of youth,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unswerving Truth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the inmost shrine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stands the image divine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only seen\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By those whose deeds have worthy been\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Priestlike clean.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those, who initiated are,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Declare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the hours\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Usher in varying hopes and powers;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It changes its face,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It changes its age,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now a young, beaming grace,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now Nestorian sage;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, to the pure in heart,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This shape of primal art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In age is fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In youth seems wise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond compare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above surprise;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What it teaches native seems,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its new lore our ancient dreams;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incense rises from the ground;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Music flows around;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Firm rest the feet below, clear gaze the eyes above,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Truth, to point the way through life, assumes the wand of Love;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, if she cast aside the robe of green,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winter's silver sheen,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White, pure as light,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Makes gentle shroud as worthy weed as bridal robe had been.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Footnote: As described by the historians:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe temple of Juno is like what the character of Woman should be.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Columns! graceful decorums, attractive yet sheltering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Porch! noble, inviting aspect of the life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaos! receives the worshippers.

From polygamy, Europe passed to the marriage de convenance. This was scarcely an improvement An attempt was then made to substitute genuine marriage (the mutual choice of souls inducing a permanent union), as yet baffled on every side by the haste, the ignorance, or the impurity of Man.\n\nWhere Man assumes a high principle to which he is not yet ripened, it will happen, for a long time, that the few will be nobler than before; the many, worse. Thus now. In the country of Sidney and Milton, the metropolis is a den of wickedness, and a sty of sensuality; in the country of Lady Russell, the custom of English peeresses, of selling their daughters to the highest bidder, is made the theme and jest of fashionable novels by unthinking children who would stare at the idea of sending them to a Turkish slave-dealer, though the circumstances of the bargain are there less degrading, as the will and thoughts of the person sold are not so degraded by it, and it is not done in defiance of an acknowledged law of right in the land and the age.\n\nI must here add that I do not believe there ever was put upon record more depravation of Man, and more despicable frivolity of thought and aim in Woman; than in the novels which purport to give the picture of English fashionable life, which are read with such favor in our drawing-rooms, and give the tone to the manners of some circles. Compared with the cold, hard-hearted folly there described, crime is hopeful; for it, at least, shows some power remaining in the mental constitution.\n\nTo return:\u2014Attention has been awakened among men to the stains of celibacy, and the profanations of marriage. They begin to write about it and lecture about it. It is the tendency now to endeavor to help the erring by showing them the physical law. This is wise and excellent; but forget not the better half. Cold bathing and exercise will not suffice to keep a life pure, without an inward baptism, and noble, exhilarating employment for the thoughts and the passions. Early marriages are desirable, but if (and the world is now so out of joint that there are a hundred thousand chances to one against it) a man does not early, or at all, find the person to whom he can be united in the marriage of souls, will you give him in the marriage de convenance? or, if not married, can you find no way for him to lead a virtuous and happy life? Think of it well, ye who think yourselves better than pagans, for many of them knew this sure way. [Footnote: The Persian sacred books, the Desatir, describe the great and holy prince Ky Khosrou, as being \u201can angel, and the son of an angel,\u201d one to whom the Supreme says, \u201cThou art not absent from before me for one twinkling of an eye. I am never out of thy heart. And I am contained in nothing but in thy heart, and in a heart like thy heart. And I am nearer unto thee than thou art to thyself.\u201d This prince had in his Golden Seraglio three ladies of surpassing beauty, and all four, in this royal monastery, passed their lives, and left the world as virgins.\n\nThe Persian people had no scepticism when the history of such a mind was narrated.]\n\nTo you, women of America, it is more especially my business to address myself on this subject, and my advice may be classed under three heads:\n\nClear your souls from the taint of vanity.\n\nDo not rejoice in conquests, either that your power to allure may be seen by other women, or for the pleasure of rousing passionate feelings that gratify your love of excitement.\n\nIt must happen, no doubt, that frank and generous women will excite love they do not reciprocate, but, in nine cases out of ten, the woman has, half consciously, done much to excite. In this case, she shall not be held guiltless, either as to the unhappiness or injury of the lover. Pure love, inspired by a worthy object, must ennoble and bless, whether mutual or not; but that which is excited by coquettish attraction of any grade of refinement, must cause bitterness and doubt, as to the reality of human goodness, so soon as the flush of passion is over. And, that you may avoid all taste for these false pleasures,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSteep the soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one pure love, and it will lost thee long.\u201d\n\nThe love of truth, the love of excellence, whether you clothe them in the person of a special object or not, will have power to save you from following Duessa, and lead you in the green glades where Una's feet have trod.\n\nIt was on this one subject that a venerable champion of good, the last representative of the spirit which sanctified the Revolution, and gave our country such a sunlight of hope in the eyes of the nations, the same who lately, in Boston, offered anew to the young men the pledge taken by the young men of his day, offered, also, his counsel, on being addressed by the principal of a girl's school, thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPLY OF MR. ADAMS.\n\nMr. Adams was so deeply affected by the address of Miss Foster, as to be for some time inaudible. When heard, he spoke as follows:\n\n\u201cThis is the first instance in which a lady has thus addressed me personally; and I trust that all the ladies present will be able sufficiently to enter into my feelings to know that I am more affected by this honor than by any other I could hare received,\n\n\u201cYou have been pleased, madam, to allude to the character of my father, and the history of my family, and their services to the country. It is indeed true that, from the existence of the republic as an independent nation, my father and myself have been in the public service of the country, almost without interruption. I came into the world, as a person having personal responsibilities, with the Declaration of Independence, which constituted us a nation. I was a child at that time, and had then perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed on man\u2014a mother who was anxious and capable to form her children to be what they ought to be. From that mother I derived whatever instruction\u2014religious especially and moral\u2014has pervaded a long life; I will not say perfectly, and as it ought to be; but I will say, because it is justice only to the memory of her whom I revere, that if, in the course of my life, there has been any imperfection, or deviation from what she taught me, the fault is mine, and not hers.\n\n\u201cWith such a mother, and such other relations with the sex, of sister, wife, and daughter, it has been the perpetual instruction of my life to love and revere the female sex. And in order to carry that sentiment of love and reverence to its highest degree of perfection, I know of nothing that exists in human society better adapted to produce that result, than institutions of the character that I have now the honor to address.\n\n\u201cI have been taught, as I have said, through the course of my life, to love and to revere the female sex; but I have been taught, also\u2014and that lesson has perhaps impressed itself on my mind even more strongly, it may be, than the other\u2014I have been taught not to flatter them. It is not unusual, in the intercourse of Man with the other sex\u2014and especially for young men\u2014to think that the way to win the hearts of ladies is by flattery. To love and to revere the sex, is what I think the duty of Man; but not to flatter them; and this I would say to the young ladies here\u2014and if they, and others present, will allow me, with all the authority which nearly four score years may have with those who have not yet attained one score\u2014I would say to them what I have no doubt they say to themselves, and are taught here, not to take the flattery of men as proof of perfection.\n\n\u201cI am now, however, I fear, assuming too much of a character that does not exactly belong to me. I therefore conclude, by assuring you, madam, that your reception of me has affected me, as you perceive, more than I can express in words; and that I shall offer my best prayers, till my latest hour, to the Creator of us all, that this institution especially, and all others of a similar kind, designed to form the female mind to wisdom and virtue, may prosper to the end of time.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to add here the character of Mr. Adams' mother, as drawn by her husband, the first John Adams, in a family letter [Footnote: Journal and Correspondence of Miss Adams, vol. i., p. 246.] written just before his death.\n\n\u201cI have reserved for the last the life of Lady Russell. This I have not yet read, because I read it more than forty years ago. On this hangs a tale which you ought to know and communicate it to your children. I bought the Life and Letters of Lady Russell in the year 1775, and sent it to your grandmother, with an express intent and desire that she should consider it a mirror in which to contemplate herself; for, at that time, I thought it extremely probable, from the daring and dangerous career I was determined to run, that she would one day find herself in the situation of Lady Russell, her husband without a head. This lady was more beautiful than Lady Russell, had a brighter genius, more information, a more refined taste, and, at least, her equal in the virtues of the heart; equal fortitude and firmness of character, equal resignation to the will of Heaven, equal in all the virtues and graces of the Christian life. Like Lady Russell, she never, by word or look, discouraged me from running all hazards for the salvation of my country's liberties; she was willing to share with me, and that her children should share with us both, in all the dangerous consequences we had to hazard.\u201d\n\nWill a woman who loves flattery or an aimless excitement, who wastes the flower of her mind on transitory sentiments, ever be loved with a love like that, when fifty years' trial have entitled to the privileges of \u201cthe golden marriage?\u201d\n\nSuch was the love of the iron-handed warrior for her, not his hand-maid, but his help-meet:\n\n\u201cWhom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\u201d\n\nI find the whole of what I want in this relation, in the two epithets by which Milton makes Adam address his wife.\n\nIn the intercourse of every day he begins:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDaughter of God and man, accomplished Eve.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Footnote: See Appendix H.]\nIn a moment of stronger feeling,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDaughter of God and man, IMMORTAL Eve.\u201d\n\nWhat majesty in the cadence of the line; what dignity, what reverence in the attitude both of giver and receiver!\n\nThe woman who permits, in her life, the alloy of vanity; the woman who lives upon flattery, coarse or fine, shall never be thus addressed, She is not immortal so far as her will is concerned, and every woman who does so creates miasma, whose spread is indefinite. The hand which casts into the waters of life a stone of offence knows not how far the circles thus caused may spread their agitations.\n\nA little while since I was at one of the most fashionable places of public resort. I saw there many women, dressed without regard to the season or the demands of the place, in apery, or, as it looked, in mockery, of European fashions. I saw their eyes restlessly courting attention. I saw the way in which it was paid; the style of devotion, almost an open sneer, which it pleased those ladies to receive from men whose expression marked their own low position in the moral and intellectual world. Those women went to their pillows with their heads full of folly, their hearts of jealousy, or gratified vanity; those men, with the low opinion they already entertained of Woman confirmed. These were American ladies; that is, they were of that class who have wealth and leisure to make full use of the day, and confer benefits on others. They were of that class whom the possession of external advantages makes of pernicious example to many, if these advantages be misused.\n\nSoon after, I met a circle of women, stamped by society as among the most degraded of their sex. \u201cHow,\u201d it was asked of them, \u201cdid you come here?\u201d for by the society that I saw in the former place they were shut up in a prison. The causes were not difficult to trace: love of dress, love of flattery, love of excitement. They had not dresses like the other ladies, so they stole them; they could not pay for flattery by distinctions, and the dower of a worldly marriage, so they paid by the profanation of their persons. In excitement, more and more madly sought from day to day, they drowned the voice of conscience.\n\nNow I ask you, my sisters, if the women at the fashionable house be not answerable for those women being in the prison?\n\nAs to position in the world of souls, we may suppose the women of the prison stood fairest, both because they had misused less light, and because loneliness and sorrow had brought some of them to feel the need of better life, nearer truth and good. This was no merit in them, being an effect of circumstance, but it was hopeful. But you, my friends (and some of you I have already met), consecrate yourselves without waiting for reproof, in free love and unbroken energy, to win and to diffuse a better life. Offer beauty, talents, riches, on the altar; thus shall you keep spotless your own hearts, and be visibly or invisibly the angels to others.\n\nI would urge upon those women who have not yet considered this subject, to do so. Do not forget the unfortunates who dare not cross your guarded way. If it do not suit you to act with those who have organized measures of reform, then hold not yourself excused from acting in private. Seek out these degraded women, give them tender sympathy, counsel, employment. Take the place of mothers, such as might have saved them originally.\n\nIf you can do little for those already under the ban of the world,\u2014and the best-considered efforts have often failed, from a want of strength in those unhappy ones to bear up against the sting of shame and the prejudices of the world, which makes them seek oblivion again in their old excitements,\u2014you will at least leave a sense of love and justice in their hearts, that will prevent their becoming utterly embittered and corrupt. And you may learn the means of prevention for those yet uninjured. These will be found in a diffusion of mental culture, simple tastes, best taught by your example, a genuine self-respect, and, above all, what the influence of Man tends to hide from Woman, the love and fear of a divine, in preference to a human tribunal.\n\nBut suppose you save many who would have lost their bodily innocence (for as to mental, the loss of that is incalculably more general), through mere vanity and folly; there still remain many, the prey and spoil of the brute passions of Man; for the stories frequent in our newspapers outshame antiquity, and vie with the horrors of war.\n\nAs to this, it must be considered that, as the vanity and proneness to seduction of the imprisoned women represented a general degradation in their sex; so do these acts a still more general and worse in the male. Where so many are weak, it is natural there should be many lost; where legislators admit that ten thousand prostitutes are a fair proportion to one city, and husbands tell their wives that it is folly to expect chastity from men, it is inevitable that there should be many monsters of vice.\n\nI must in this place mention, with respect and gratitude, the conduct of Mrs. Child in the case of Amelia Norman. The action and speech of this lady was of straightforward nobleness, undeterred by custom or cavil from duty toward an injured sister. She showed the case and the arguments the counsel against the prisoner had the assurance to use in their true light to the public. She put the case on the only ground of religion and equity. She was successful in arresting the attention of many who had before shrugged their shoulders, and let sin pass as necessarily a part of the company of men. They begin to ask whether virtue is not possible, perhaps necessary, to Man as well as to Woman. They begin to fear that the perdition of a woman must involve that of a man. This is a crisis. The results of this case will be important.\n\nIn this connection I must mention Eugene Sue, the French novelist, several of whose works have been lately translated among us, as having the true spirit of reform as to women. Like every other French writer, he is still tainted with the transmissions of the old regime. Still, falsehood may be permitted for the sake of advancing truth, evil as the way to good. Even George Sand, who would trample on every graceful decorum, and every human law, for the sake of a sincere life, does not see that she violates it by making her heroines able to tell falsehoods in a good cause. These French writers need ever to be confronted by the clear perception of the English and German mind, that the only good man, consequently the only good reformer, is he\n\n\u201cWho bases good on good alone, and owes\nTo virtue every triumph that he knows.\u201d\n\nStill, Sue has the heart of a reformer, and especially towards women; he sees what they need, and what causes are injuring them. From the histories of Fleur de Marie and La Louve, from the lovely and independent character of Rigolette, from the distortion given to Matilda's mind, by the present views of marriage, and from the truly noble and immortal character of the \u201chump-backed Sempstress\u201d in the \u201cWandering Jew,\u201d may be gathered much that shall elucidate doubt and direct inquiry on this subject. In reform, as in philosophy, the French are the interpreters to the civilized world. Their own attainments are not great, but they make clear the post, and break down barriers to the future.\n\nObserve that the good man of Sue is as pure as Sir Charles Grandison.\n\nApropos to Sir Charles. Women are accustomed to be told by men that the reform is to come from them. \u201cYou,\u201d say the men, \u201cmust frown upon vice; you must decline the attentions of the corrupt; you must not submit to the will of your husband when it seems to you unworthy, but give the laws in marriage, and redeem it from its present sensual and mental pollutions.\u201d\n\nThis seems to us hard. Men have, indeed, been, for more than a hundred years, rating women for countenancing vice. But, at the same time, they have carefully hid from them its nature, so that the preference often shown by women for bad men arises rather from a confused idea that they are bold and adventurous, acquainted with regions which women are forbidden to explore, and the curiosity that ensues, than a corrupt heart in the woman. As to marriage, it has been inculcated on women, for centuries, that men have not only stronger passions than they, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share or even understand; that, therefore, they must \u201cconfide in their husbands,\u201d that is, submit implicitly to their will; that the least appearance of coldness or withdrawal, from whatever cause, in the wife is wicked, because liable to turn her husband's thoughts to illicit indulgence; for a man is so constituted that he must indulge his passions or die!\n\nAccordingly, a great part of women look upon men as a kind of wild beasts, but \u201csuppose they are all alike;\u201d the unmarried are assured by the married that, \u201cif they knew men as they do,\u201d that is, by being married to them, \u201cthey would not expect continence or self-government from them.\u201d\n\nI might accumulate illustrations on this theme, drawn from acquaintance with the histories of women, which would startle and grieve all thinking men, but I forbear. Let Sir Charles Grandison preach to his own sex; or if none there be who feels himself able to speak with authority from a life unspotted in will or deed, let those who are convinced of the practicability and need of a pure life, as the foreign artist was, advise the others, and warn them by their own example, if need be.\n\nThe following passage, from a female writer, on female affairs, expresses a prevalent way of thinking on this subject:\n\n\u201cIt may be that a young woman, exempt from all motives of vanity, determines to take for a husband a man who does not inspire her with a very decided inclination. Imperious circumstances, the evident interest of her family, or the danger of suffering celibacy, may explain such a resolution. If, however, she were to endeavor to surmount a personal repugnance, we should look upon this as injudicious. Such a rebellion of nature marks the limit that the influence of parents, or the self-sacrifice of the young girl, should never pass. We shall be told that this repugnance is an affair of the imagination. It may be so; but imagination is a power which it is temerity to brave; and its antipathy is more difficult to conquer than its preference.\u201d [Footnote: Madame Necker de Saussure.]\n\nAmong ourselves, the exhibition of such a repugnance from a woman who had been given in marriage \u201cby advice of friends,\u201d was treated by an eminent physician as sufficient proof of insanity. If he had said sufficient cause for it, he would have been nearer right.\n\nIt has been suggested by men who were pained by seeing bad men admitted, freely, to the society of modest women,\u2014thereby encouraged to vice by impunity, and corrupting the atmosphere of homes,\u2014that there should be a senate of the matrons in each city and town, who should decide what candidates were fit for admission to their houses and the society of their daughters. [Footnote: See Goethe's Tasso. \u201cA synod of good women should decide,\u201d\u2014if the golden age is to be restored.]\n\nSuch a plan might have excellent results; but it argues a moral dignity and decision which does not yet exist, and needs to be induced by knowledge and reflection. It has been the tone to keep women ignorant on these subjects, or, when they were not, to command that they should seem so. \u201cIt is indelicate,\u201d says the father or husband, \u201cto inquire into the private character of such an one. It is sufficient that I do not think him unfit to visit you.\u201d And so, this man, who would not tolerate these pages in his house, \u201cunfit for family reading,\u201d because they speak plainly, introduces there a man whose shame is written on his brow, as well as the open secret of the whole town, and, presently, if respectable still, and rich enough, gives him his daughter to wife. The mother affects ignorance, \u201csupposing he is no worse than most men.\u201d The daughter is ignorant; something in the mind of the new spouse seems strange to her, but she supposes it is \u201cwoman's lot\u201d not to be perfectly happy in her affections; she has always heard, \u201cmen could not understand women,\u201d so she weeps alone, or takes to dress and the duties of the house. The husband, of course, makes no avowal, and dreams of no redemption.\n\n\u201cIn the heart of every young woman,\u201d says the female writer above quoted, addressing herself to the husband, \u201cdepend upon it, there is a fund of exalted ideas; she conceals, represses, without succeeding in smothering them. So long as these ideas in your wife are directed to YOU, they are, no doubt, innocent, but take care that they be not accompanied with too much pain. In other respects, also, spare her delicacy. Let all the antecedent parts of your life, if there are such, which would give her pain, be concealed from her; her happiness and her respect for you would suffer from this misplaced confidence. Allow her to retain that flower of purity, which should distinguish her, in your eyes, from every other woman.\u201d We should think so, truly, under this canon. Such a man must esteem purity an exotic that could only be preserved by the greatest care. Of the degree of mental intimacy possible, in such a marriage, let every one judge for himself!\n\nOn this subject, let every woman, who has once begun to think, examine herself; see whether she does not suppose virtue possible and necessary to Man, and whether she would not desire for her son a virtue which aimed at a fitness for a divine life, and involved, if not asceticism, that degree of power over the lower self, which shall \u201cnot exterminate the passions, but keep them chained at the feet of reason.\u201d The passions, like fire, are a bad muster; but confine them to the hearth and the altar, and they give life to the social economy, and make each sacrifice meet for heaven.\n\nWhen many women have thought upon this subject, some will be fit for the senate, and one such senate in operation would affect the morals of the civilized world.\n\nAt present I look to the young. As preparatory to the senate, I should like to see a society of novices, such as the world has never yet seen, bound by no oath, wearing no badge, In place of an oath, they should have a religious faith in the capacity of Man for virtue; instead of a badge, should wear in the heart a firm resolve not to stop short of the destiny promised him as a son of God. Their service should be action and conservatism, not of old habits, but of a better nature, enlightened by hopes that daily grow brighter.\n\nIf sin was to remain in the world, it should not be by their connivance at its stay, or one moment's concession to its claims.\n\nThey should succor the oppressed, and pay to the upright the reverence due in hero-worship by seeking to emulate them. They would not denounce the willingly bad, but they could not be with them, for the two classes could not breathe the same atmosphere.\n\nThey would heed no detention from the time-serving, the worldly and the timid.\n\nThey could love no pleasures that were not innocent and capable of good fruit,\n\nI saw, in a foreign paper, the title now given to a party abroad, \u201cLos Exaltados.\u201d Such would be the title now given these children by the world: Los Exaltados, Las Exaltadas; but the world would not sneer always, for from them would issue a virtue by which it would, at last, be exalted too.\n\nI have in my eye a youth and a maiden whom I look to as the nucleus of such a class. They are both in early youth; both as yet uncontaminated; both aspiring, without rashness; both thoughtful; both capable of deep affection; both of strong nature and sweet feelings; both capable of large mental development. They reside in different regions of earth, but their place in the soul is the same. To them I look, as, perhaps, the harbingers and leaders of a new era, for never yet have I known minds so truly virgin, without narrowness or ignorance.\n\nWhen men call upon women to redeem them, they mean such maidens. But such are not easily formed under the present influences of society. As there are more such young men to help give a different tone, there will be more such maidens.\n\nThe English, novelist, D'Israeli, has, in his novel of \u201cThe Young Duke,\u201d made a man of the most depraved stock be redeemed by a woman who despises him when he has only the brilliant mask of fortune and beauty to cover the poverty of his heart and brain, but knows how to encourage him when he enters on a better course. But this woman was educated by a father who valued character in women.\n\nStill, there will come now and then one who will, as I hope of my young Exaltada, be example and instruction for the rest. It was not the opinion of Woman current among Jewish men that formed the character of the mother of Jesus.\n\nSince the sliding and backsliding men of the world, no less than the mystics, declare that, as through Woman Man was lost, so through Woman must Man be redeemed, the time must be at hand. When she knows herself indeed as \u201caccomplished,\u201d still more as \u201cimmortal Eve,\u201d this may be.\n\nAs an immortal, she may also know and inspire immortal love, a happiness not to be dreamed of under the circumstances advised in the last quotation. Where love is based on concealment, it must, of course, disappear when the soul enters the scene of clear vision!\n\nAnd, without this hope, how worthless every plan, every bond, every power!\n\n\u201cThe giants,\u201d said the Scandinavian Saga, \u201chad induced Loke (the spirit that hovers between good and ill) to steal for them Iduna (Goddess of Immortality) and her apples of pure gold. He lured her out, by promising to show, on a marvellous tree he had discovered, apples beautiful as her own, if she would only take them with her for a comparison. Thus having lured her beyond the heavenly domain, she was seized and carried away captive by the powers of misrule.\n\n\u201cAs now the gods could not find their friend Iduna, they were confused with grief; indeed, they began visibly to grow old and gray. Discords arose, and love grew cold. Indeed, Odur, spouse of the goddess of love and beauty, wandered away, and returned no more. At last, however, the gods, discovering the treachery of Loke, obliged him to win back Iduna from the prison in which she sat mourning. He changed himself into a falcon, and brought her back as a swallow, fiercely pursued by the Giant King, in the form of an eagle. So she strives to return among us, light and small as a swallow. We must welcome her form as the speck on the sky that assures the glad blue of Summer. Yet one swallow does not make a summer. Let us solicit them in flights and flocks!\u201d\n\nReturning from the future to the present, let us see what forms Iduna takes, as she moves along the declivity of centuries to the valley where the lily flower may concentrate all its fragrance.\n\nIt would seem as if this time were not very near to one fresh from books, such as I have of late been\u2014no: not reading, but sighing over. A crowd of books having been sent me since my friends knew me to be engaged in this way, on Woman's \u201cSphere,\u201d, Woman's \u201cMission,\u201d and Woman's \u201cDestiny,\u201d I believe that almost all that is extant of formal precept has come under my eye. Among these I read with refreshment a little one called \u201cThe Whole Duty of Woman,\u201d \u201cindited by a noble lady at the request of a noble lord,\u201d and which has this much of nobleness, that the view it takes is a religious one. It aims to fit Woman for heaven; the main bent of most of the others is to fit her to please, or, at least, not to disturb, a husband.\n\nAmong these I select, as a favorable specimen, the book I have already quoted, \u201cThe Study [Footnote: This title seems to be incorrectly translated from the French. I have not seen the original] of the Life of Woman, by Madame Necker de Saussure, of Geneva, translated from the French.\u201d This book was published at Philadelphia, and has been read with much favor here. Madame Necker is the cousin of Madame de Stael, and has taken from her works the motto prefixed to this.\n\n\u201cCette vie n'a quelque prix que si elle sert a' l'education morale do notre coeur.\u201d\n\nMde. Necker is, by nature, capable of entire consistency in the application of this motto, and, therefore, the qualifications she makes, in the instructions given to her own sex, show forcibly the weight which still paralyzes and distorts the energies of that sex.\n\nThe book is rich in passages marked by feeling and good suggestions; but, taken in the whole, the impression it leaves is this:\n\nWoman is, and shall remain, inferior to Man and subject to his will, and, in endeavoring to aid her, we must anxiously avoid anything that can be misconstrued into expression of the contrary opinion, else the men will be alarmed, and combine to defeat our efforts.\n\nThe present is a good time for these efforts, for men are less occupied about women than formerly. Let us, then, seize upon the occasion, and do what we can to make our lot tolerable. But we must sedulously avoid encroaching on the territory of Man. If we study natural history, our observations may be made useful, by some male naturalist; if we draw well, we may make our services acceptable to the artists. But our names must not be known; and, to bring these labors to any result, we must take some man for our head, and be his hands.\n\nThe lot of Woman is sad. She is constituted to expect and need a happiness that cannot exist on earth. She must stifle such aspirations within her secret heart, and fit herself, as well as she can, for a life of resignations and consolations.\n\nShe will be very lonely while living with her husband. She must not expect to open her heart to him fully, or that, after marriage, he will be capable of the refined service of love. The man is not born for the woman, only the woman for the man. \u201cMen cannot understand the hearts of women.\u201d The life of Woman must be outwardly a well-intentioned, cheerful dissimulation of her real life.\n\nNaturally, the feelings of the mother, at the birth of a female child, resemble those of the Paraguay woman, described by Southey as lamenting in such heart-breaking tones that her mother did not kill her the hour she was born,\u2014\u201dher mother, who knew what this life of a woman must be;\u201d\u2014or of those women seen at the north by Sir A. Mackenzie, who performed this pious duty towards female infants whenever they had an opportunity.\n\n\u201cAfter the first delight, the young mother experiences feelings a little different, according as the birth of a son or a daughter has been announced.\n\n\u201cIs it a son? A sort of glory swells at this thought the heart of the mother; she seems to feel that she is entitled to gratitude. She has given a citizen, a defender, to her country; to her husband an heir of his name; to herself a protector. And yet the contrast of all these fine titles with this being, so humble, soon strikes her. At the aspect of this frail treasure, opposite feelings agitate her heart; she seems to recognise in him a nature superior to her own, but subjected to a low condition, and she honors a future greatness in the object of extreme compassion. Somewhat of that respect and adoration for a feeble child, of which some fine pictures offer the expression in the features of the happy Mary, seem reproduced with the young mother who has given birth to a son.\n\n\u201cIs it a daughter? There is usually a slight degree of regret; so deeply rooted is the idea of the superiority of Man in happiness and dignity; and yet, as she looks upon this child, she is more and more softened towards it. A deep sympathy\u2014a sentiment of identity with this delicate being\u2014takes possession of her; an extreme pity for so much weakness, a more pressing need of prayer, stirs her heart. Whatever sorrows she may have felt, she dreads for her daughter; but she will guide her to become much wiser, much better than herself. And then the gayety, the frivolity of the young woman have their turn. This little creature is a flower to cultivate, a doll to decorate.\u201d\n\nSimilar sadness at the birth of a daughter I have heard mothers express not unfrequently.\n\nAs to this living so entirely for men, I should think when it was proposed to women they would feel, at least, some spark of the old spirit of races allied to our own. \u201cIf he is to be my bridegroom and lord\u201d cries Brunhilda, [Footnote: See the Nibelungen Lays.] \u201che must first be able to pass through fire and water.\u201d \u201cI will serve at the banquet,\u201d says the Walkyrie, \u201cbut only him who, in the trial of deadly combat, has shown himself a hero.\u201d\n\nIf women are to be bond-maids, let it be to men superior to women in fortitude, in aspiration, in moral power, in refined sense of beauty. You who give yourselves \u201cto be supported,\u201d or because \u201cone must love something,\u201d are they who make the lot of the sex such that mothers are sad when daughters are born.\n\nIt marks the state of feeling on this subject that it was mentioned, as a bitter censure on a woman who had influence over those younger than herself,\u2014\u201dShe makes those girls want to see heroes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd will that hurt them?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly; how can you ask? They will find none, and so they will never be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet married\u201d is the usual phrase, and the one that correctly indicates the thought; but the speakers, on this occasion, were persons too outwardly refined to use it. They were ashamed of the word, but not of the thing. Madame Necker, however, sees good possible in celibacy.\n\nIndeed, I know not how the subject could be better illustrated, than by separating the wheat from the chaff in Madame Necker's book; place them in two heaps, and then summon the reader to choose; giving him first a near-sighted glass to examine the two;\u2014it might be a Christian, an astronomical, or an artistic glass,\u2014any kind of good glass to obviate acquired defects in the eye. I would lay any wager on the result.\n\nBut time permits not here a prolonged analysis. I have given the clues for fault-finding.\n\nAs a specimen of the good take the following passage, on the phenomena of what I have spoken of, as the lyrical or electric element in Woman.\n\n\u201cWomen have been seen to show themselves poets in the most pathetic pantomimic scenes, where all the passions were depicted full of beauty; and these poets used a language unknown to themselves, and, the performance once over, their inspiration was a forgotten dream. Without doubt there is an interior development to beings so gifted; but their sole mode of communication with us is their talent. They are, ill all besides, the inhabitants of another planet.\u201d\n\nSimilar observations have been made by those who have seen the women at Irish wakes, or the funeral ceremonies of modern Greece or Brittany, at times when excitement gave the impulse to genius; but, apparently, without a thought that these rare powers belonged to no other planet, but were a high development of the growth of this, and might, by wise and reverent treatment, be made to inform and embellish the scenes of every day. But, when Woman has her fair chance, she will do so, and the poem of the hour will vie with that of the ages.\n\nI come now with satisfaction to my own country, and to a writer, a female writer, whom I have selected as the clearest, wisest, and kindliest, who has, as yet, used pen here on these subjects. This is Miss Sedgwick.\n\nMiss Sedgwick, though she inclines to the private path, and wishes that, by the cultivation of character, might should vindicate right, sets limits nowhere, and her objects and inducements are pure. They are the free and careful cultivation of the powers that have been given, with an aim at moral and intellectual perfection. Her speech is moderate and sane, but never palsied by fear or sceptical caution.\n\nHerself a fine example of the independent and beneficent existence that intellect and character can give to Woman, no less than Man, if she know how to seek and prize it,\u2014also, that the intellect need not absorb or weaken, but rather will refine and invigorate, the affections,\u2014the teachings of her practical good sense come with great force, and cannot fail to avail much. Every way her writings please me both as to the means and the ends. I am pleased at the stress she lays on observance of the physical laws, because the true reason is given. Only in a strong and clean body can the soul do its message fitly.\n\nShe shows the meaning of the respect paid to personal neatness, both in the indispensable form of cleanliness, and of that love of order and arrangement, that must issue from a true harmony of feeling.\n\nThe praises of cold water seem to me an excellent sign in the age. They denote a tendency to the true life. We are now to have, as a remedy for ills, not orvietan, or opium, or any quack medicine, but plenty of air and water, with due attention to warmth and freedom in dress, and simplicity of diet.\n\nEvery day we observe signs that the natural feelings on these subjects are about to be re\u00efnstated, and the body to claim care as the abode and organ of the soul; not as the tool of servile labor, or the object of voluptuous indulgence.\n\nA poor woman, who had passed through the lowest grades of ignominy, seemed to think she had never been wholly lost, \u201cfor,\u201d said she, \u201cI would always have good under-clothes;\u201d and, indeed, who could doubt that this denoted the remains of private self-respect in the mind?\n\nA woman of excellent sense said, \u201cIt might seem childish, but to her one of the most favorable signs of the times was that the ladies had been persuaded to give up corsets.\u201d\n\nYes! let us give up all artificial means of distortion. Let life be healthy, pure, all of a piece. Miss Sedgwick, in teaching that domestics must have the means of bathing us much as their mistresses, and time, too, to bathe, has symbolized one of the most important of human rights.\n\nAnother interesting sign of the time is the influence exercised by two women, Miss Martineau and Miss Barrett, from their sick-rooms. The lamp of life which, if it had been fed only by the affections, depended on precarious human relations, would scarce have been able to maintain a feeble glare in the lonely prison, now shines far and wide over the nations, cheering fellow-sufferers and hallowing the joy of the healthful.\n\nThese persons need not health or youth, or the charms of personal presence, to make their thoughts available. A few more such, and \u201cold woman\u201d [Footnote: An apposite passage is quoted in Appendix F.] shall not be the synonyme for imbecility, nor \u201cold maid\u201d a term of contempt, nor Woman be spoken of as a reed shaken by the wind.\n\nIt is time, indeed, that men and women both should cease to grow old in any other way than as the tree does, full of grace and honor. The hair of the artist turns white, but his eye shines clearer than ever, and we feel that age brings him maturity, not decay. So would it be with all, were the springs of immortal refreshment but unsealed within the soul; then, like these women, they would see, from the lonely chamber window, the glories of the universe; or, shut in darkness, be visited by angels.\n\nI now touch on my own place and day, and, as I write, events are occurring that threaten the fair fabric approached by so long an avenue. Week before last, the Gentile was requested to aid the Jew to return to Palestine; for the Millennium, the reign of the Son of Mary was near. Just now, at high and solemn mass, thanks were returned to the Virgin for having delivered O'Connell from unjust imprisonment, in requital of his having consecrated to her the league formed in behalf of Liberty on Tara's Hill. But last week brought news which threatens that a cause identical with the enfranchisement of Jews, Irish, women, ay, and of Americans in general, too, is in danger, for the choice of the people threatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy of sin permanently on this nation, through the Annexation of Texas!\n\nAh! if this should take place, who will dare again to feel the throb of heavenly hope, as to the destiny of this country? The noble thought that gave unity to all our knowledge, harmony to all our designs,\u2014the thought that the progress of history had brought on the era, the tissue of prophecies pointed out the spot, where humanity was, at last, to have a fair chance to know itself, and all men be born free and equal for the eagle's flight,\u2014flutters as if about to leave the breast, which, deprived of it, will have no more a nation, no more a home on earth.\n\nWomen of my country!\u2014Exaltadas! if such there be,\u2014women of English, old English nobleness, who understand the courage of Boadicea, the sacrifice of Godiva, the power of Queen Emma to tread the red-hot iron unharmed,\u2014women who share the nature of Mrs. Hutchinson, Lady Russell, and the mothers of our own revolution,\u2014have you nothing to do with this? You see the men, how they are willing to sell shamelessly the happiness of countless generations of fellow-creatures, the honor of their country, and their immortal souls, for a money market and political power. Do you not feel within you that which can reprove them, which can check, which can convince them? You would not speak in vain; whether each in her own home, or banded in unison.\n\nTell these men that you will not accept the glittering baubles, spacious dwellings, and plentiful service, they mean to offer you through those means. Tell them that the heart of Woman demands nobleness and honor in Man, and that, if they have not purity, have not mercy, they are no longer fathers, lovers, husbands, sons of yours.\n\nThis cause is your own, for, as I have before said, there is a reason why the foes of African Slavery seek more freedom for women; but put it not upon that ground, but on the ground of right.\n\nIf you have a power, it is a moral power. The films of interest are not so close around you as around the men. If you will but think, you cannot fail to wish to save the country from this disgrace. Let not slip the occasion, but do something to lift off the curse incurred by Eve.\n\nYou have heard the women engaged in the Abolition movement accused of boldness, because they lifted the voice in public, and lifted the latch of the stranger. But were these acts, whether performed judiciously or no, so bold as to dare before God and Man to partake the fruits of such offence as this?\n\nYou hear much of the modesty of your sex. Preserve it by filling the mind with noble desires that shall ward off the corruptions of vanity and idleness. A profligate woman, who left her accustomed haunts and took service in a New York boarding-house, said \u201cshe had never heard talk so vile at the Five Points, as from the ladies at the boarding-house.\u201d And why? Because they were idle; because, having nothing worthy to engage them, they dwelt, with unnatural curiosity, on the ill they dared not go to see.\n\nIt will not so much injure your modesty to have your name, by the unthinking, coupled with idle blame, as to have upon your soul the weight of not trying to save a whole race of women from the scorn that is put upon their modesty.\n\nThink of this well! I entreat, I conjure you, before it is too late. It is my belief that something effectual might be done by women, if they would only consider the subject, and enter upon it in the true spirit,\u2014a spirit gentle, but firm, and which feared the offence of none, save One who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.\n\nAnd now I have designated in outline, if not in fulness, the stream which is ever flowing from the heights of my thought.\n\nIn the earlier tract I was told I did not make my meaning sufficiently clear. In this I have consequently tried to illustrate it in various ways, and may have been guilty of much repetition. Yet, as I am anxious to leave no room for doubt, I shall venture to retrace, once more, the scope of my design in points, as wad done in old-fashioned sermons.\n\nMan is a being of two-fold relations, to nature beneath, and intelligences above him. The earth is his school, if not his birth-place; God his object; life and thought his means of interpreting nature, and aspiring to God.\n\nOnly a fraction of this purpose is accomplished in the life of any one man. Its entire accomplishment is to be hoped only from the sum of the lives of men, or Man considered as a whole.\n\nAs this whole has one soul and one body, any injury or obstruction to a part, or to the meanest member, affects the whole. Man can never be perfectly happy or virtuous, till all men are so.\n\nTo address Man wisely, you must not forget that his life is partly animal, subject to the same laws with Nature.\n\nBut you cannot address him wisely unless you consider him still more as soul, and appreciate the conditions and destiny of soul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The growth of Man is two-fold, masculine and feminine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as these two methods can be distinguished, they are so as\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Energy and Harmony;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power and Beauty;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intellect and Love;\n\nor by some such rude classification; for we have not language primitive and pure enough to express such ideas with precision.\n\nThese two sides are supposed to be expressed in Man and Woman, that is, as the more and the less, for the faculties have not been given pure to either, but only in preponderance. There are also exceptions in great number, such as men of far more beauty than power, and the reverse. But, as a general rule, it seems to have been the intention to give a preponderance on the one side, that is called masculine, and on the other, one that is called feminine.\n\nThere cannot be a doubt that, if these two developments were in perfect harmony, they would correspond to and fulfil one another, like hemispheres, or the tenor and bass in music.\n\nBut there is no perfect harmony in human nature; and the two parts answer one another only now and then; or, if there be a persistent consonance, it can only be traced at long intervals, instead of discoursing an obvious melody.\n\nWhat is the cause of this?\n\nMan, in the order of time, was developed first; as energy comes before harmony; power before beauty.\n\nWoman was therefore under his care as an elder. He might have been her guardian and teacher.\n\nBut, as human nature goes not straight forward, but by excessive action and then reaction in an undulated course, he misunderstood and abused his advantages, and became her temporal master instead of her spiritual sire.\n\nOn himself came the punishment. He educated Woman more as a servant than a daughter, and found himself a king without a queen.\n\nThe children of this unequal union showed unequal natures, and, more and more, men seemed sons of the handmaid, rather than princess.\n\nAt last, there were so many Ishmaelites that the rest grew frightened and indignant. They laid the blame on Hagar, and drove her forth into the wilderness.\n\nBut there were none the fewer Ishmaelites for that.\n\nAt last men became a little wiser, and saw that the infant Moses was, in every case, saved by the pure instincts of Woman's breast. For, as too much adversity is better for the moral nature than too much prosperity, Woman, in this respect, dwindled less than Man, though in other respects still a child in leading-strings.\n\nSo Man did her more and more justice, and grew more and more kind.\n\nBut yet\u2014his habits and his will corrupted by the past\u2014he did not clearly see that Woman was half himself; that her interests were identical with his; and that, by the law of their common being, he could never reach his true proportions while she remained in any wise shorn of hers.\n\nAnd so it has gone on to our day; both ideas developing, but more slowly than they would under a clearer recognition of truth and justice, which would have permitted the sexes their due influence on one another, and mutual improvement from more dignified relations.\n\nWherever there was pure love, the natural influences were, for the time, restored.\n\nWherever the poet or artist gave free course to his genius, he saw the truth, and expressed it in worthy forms, for these men especially share and need the feminine principle. The divine birds need to be brooded into life and song by mothers.\n\nWherever religion (I mean the thirst for truth and good, not the love of sect and dogma) had its course, the original design was apprehended in its simplicity, and the dove presaged sweetly from Dodona's oak.\n\nI have aimed to show that no age was left entirely without a witness of the equality of the sexes in function, duty and hope.\n\nAlso that, when there was unwillingness or ignorance, which prevented this being acted upon, women had not the less power for their want of light and noble freedom. But it was power which hurt alike them and those against whom they made use of the arms of the servile,\u2014cunning, blandishment, and unreasonable emotion.\n\nThat now the time has come when a clearer vision and better action are possible\u2014when Man and Woman may regard one another, as brother and sister, the pillars of one porch, the priests of one worship.\n\nI have believed and intimated that this hope would receive an ampler fruition, than ever before, in our own land.\n\nAnd it will do so if this land carry out the principles from which sprang our national life.\n\nI believe that, at present, women are the best helpers of one another.\n\nLet them think; let them act; till they know what they need.\n\nWe only ask of men to remove arbitrary barriers. Some would like to do more. But I believe it needs that Woman show herself in her native dignity, to teach them how to aid her; their minds are so encumbered by tradition.\n\nWhen Lord Edward Fitzgerald travelled with the Indians, his manly heart obliged him at once to take the packs from the squaws and carry them. But we do not read that the red men followed his example, though they are ready enough to carry the pack of the white woman, because she seems to them a superior being.\n\nLet Woman appear in the mild majesty of Ceres, and rudest churls will be willing to learn from her.\n\nYou ask, what use will she make of liberty, when she has so long been sustained and restrained?\n\nI answer; in the first place, this will not be suddenly given. I read yesterday a debate of this year on the subject of enlarging women's rights over property. It was a leaf from the class-book that is preparing for the needed instruction. The men learned visibly as they spoke. The champions of Woman saw the fallacy of arguments on the opposite side, and were startled by their own convictions. With their wives at home, and the readers of the paper, it was the same. And so the stream flows on; thought urging action, and action leading to the evolution of still better thought.\n\nBut, were this freedom to come suddenly, I have no fear of the consequences. Individuals might commit excesses, but there is not only in the sex a reverence for decorums and limits inherited and enhanced from generation to generation, which many years of other life could not efface, but a native love, in Woman as Woman, of proportion, of \u201cthe simple art of not too much,\u201d\u2014a Greek moderation, which would create immediately a restraining party, the natural legislators and instructors of the rest, and would gradually establish such rules as are needed to guard, without impeding, life.\n\nThe Graces would lead the choral dance, and teach the rest to regulate their steps to the measure of beauty.\n\nBut if you ask me what offices they may fill, I reply\u2014any. I do not care what case you put; let them be sea-captains, if you will. I do not doubt there are women well fitted for such an office, and, if so, I should be as glad to see them in it, as to welcome the maid of Saragossa, or the maid of Missolonghi, or the Suliote heroine, or Emily Plater.\n\nI think women need, especially at this juncture, a much greater range of occupation than they have, to rouse their latent powers. A party of travellers lately visited a lonely hut on a mountain. There they found an old woman, who told them she and her husband had lived there forty years. \u201cWhy,\u201d they said, \u201cdid you choose so barren a spot?\u201d She \u201cdid not know; it was the man's notion.\u201d\n\nAnd, during forty years, she had been content to act, without knowing why, upon \u201cthe man's notion.\u201d I would not have it so.\n\nIn families that I know, some little girls like to saw wood, others to use carpenters' tools. Where these tastes are indulged, cheerfulness and good-humor are promoted. Where they are forbidden, because \u201csuch things are not proper for girls,\u201d they grow sullen and mischievous.\n\nFourier had observed these wants of women, as no one can fail to do who watches the desires of little girls, or knows the ennui that haunts grown women, except where they make to themselves a serene little world by art of some kind. He, therefore, in proposing a great variety of employments, in manufactures or the care of plants and animals, allows for one third of women as likely to have a taste for masculine pursuits, one third of men for feminine.\n\nWho does not observe the immediate glow and serenity that is diffused over the life of women, before restless or fretful, by engaging in gardening, building, or the lowest department of art? Here is something that is not routine, something that draws forth life towards the infinite.\n\nI have no doubt, however, that a large proportion of women would give themselves to the same employments as now, because there are circumstances that must lead them. Mothers will delight to make the nest soft and warm. Nature would take care of that; no need to clip the wings of any bird that wants to soar and sing, or finds in itself the strength of pinion for a migratory flight unusual to its kind. The difference would be that all need not be constrained to employments for which some are unfit.\n\nI have urged upon the sex self-subsistence in its two forms of self-reliance and self-impulse, because I believe them to be the needed means of the present juncture.\n\nI have urged on Woman independence of Man, not that I do not think the sexes mutually needed by one another, but because in Woman this fact has led to an excessive devotion, which has cooled love, degraded marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should be to itself or the other.\n\nI wish Woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty. Then, if she finds what she needs in Man embodied, she will know how to love, and be worthy of being loved.\n\nBy being more a soul, she will not be less Woman, for nature is perfected through spirit.\n\nNow there is no woman, only an overgrown child.\n\nThat her hand may be given with dignity, she must be able to stand alone. I wish to see men and women capable of such relations as are depicted by Landor in his Pericles and Aspasia, where grace is the natural garb of strength, and the affections are calm, because deep. The softness is that of a firm tissue, as when\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe gods approve\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The depth, but not the tumult of the soul,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fervent, not ungovernable love.\u201d\n\nA profound thinker has said, \u201cNo married woman can represent the female world, for she belongs to her husband. The idea of Woman must be represented by a virgin.\u201d\n\nBut that is the very fault of marriage, and of the present relation between the sexes, that the woman does belong to the man, instead of forming a whole with him. Were it otherwise, there would be no such limitation to the thought.\n\nWoman, self-centred, would never be absorbed by any relation; it would be only an experience to her as to man. It is a vulgar error that love, a love, to Woman is her whole existence; she also is born for Truth and Love in their universal energy. Would she but assume her inheritance, Mary would not be the only virgin mother. Not Manzoni alone would celebrate in his wife the virgin mind with the maternal wisdom and conjugal affections. The soul is ever young, ever virgin.\n\nAnd will not she soon appear?\u2014the woman who shall vindicate their birthright for all women; who shall teach them what to claim, and how to use what they obtain? Shall not her name be for her era Victoria, for her country and life Virginia? Yet predictions are rash; she herself must teach us to give her the fitting name.\n\nAn idea not unknown to ancient times has of late been revived, that, in the metamorphoses of life, the soul assumes the form, first of Man, then of Woman, and takes the chances, and reaps the benefits of either lot. Why then, say some, lay such emphasis on the rights or needs of Woman? What she wins not as Woman will come to her as Man.\n\nThat makes no difference. It is not Woman, but the law of right, the law of growth, that speaks in us, and demands the perfection of each being in its kind\u2014apple as apple, Woman as Woman. Without adopting your theory, I know that I, a daughter, live through the life of Man; but what concerns me now is, that my life be a beautiful, powerful, in a word, a complete life in its kind. Had I but one more moment to live I must wish the same.\n\nSuppose, at the end of your cycle, your great world-year, all will be completed, whether I exert myself or not (and the supposition is false,\u2014but suppose it true), am I to be indifferent about it? Not so! I must beat my own pulse true in the heart of the world; for that is virtue, excellence, health.\n\nThou, Lord of Day! didst leave us to-night so calmly glorious, not dismayed that cold winter is coming, not postponing thy beneficence to the fruitful summer! Thou didst smile on thy day's work when it was done, and adorn thy down-going as thy up-rising, for thou art loyal, and it is thy nature to give life, if thou canst, and shine at all events!\n\nI stand in the sunny noon of life. Objects no longer glitter in the dews of morning, neither are yet softened by the shadows of evening. Every spot is seen, every chasm revealed. Climbing the dusty hill, some fair effigies that once stood for symbols of human destiny have been broken; those I still have with me show defects in this broad light. Yet enough is left, even by experience, to point distinctly to the glories of that destiny; faint, but not to be mistaken streaks of the future day. I can say with the bard,\n\n\u201cThough many have suffered shipwreck, still beat noble hearts.\u201d\nAlways the soul says to us all, Cherish your best hopes as a faith, and abide by them in action. Such shall be the effectual fervent means to their fulfilment;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Power to whom we bow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has

nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\n\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\n\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\n\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube.

And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appeals in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.)

And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.)

Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.)

The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.)

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead.

Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!\n\n\n(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)", "http://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated"], "2411101": ["Intro to Anxiety by\u00a0Hoodie\u00a0Allen", "Intro to Anxiety

jealousy\nTwo days later, she write back, like S-R-Y, I fell asleep\nI think I'll be alone forever, maybe I'll live with my parents\nThat way I could eat the food and never feel embarrassed

2]\nOkay class, settle down, this is your teacher talking\nI got the girls in the OC flipping like Mischa Barton\nThe only time I socialize is at a pizza party\nUsually I see a party, overthink and keep on walking\nCause what if the friends I came with leave me with a bunch of strangers?\nStanding all alone, I won't have no one to play drinking games with\nAnd now I'm semi-famous, all they want's a selfie with me\nOr several shots of whiskey to test my masculinity\nAnd see how we compare or have a story for their friends\nBut I still feel like just some fucking guy so none of it makes sense\nI don't need attention, I need an intervention\nFrom the internet like I got sent home from a school suspension\nStaring at my ceiling and I'm trying to make sense of it\nAsking no one in particular, \"Is this the best it gets?\"\nSwear to God, I hope it's not\nAlso know I shouldn't swear\nUsed to give a thousand fucks but nowadays I just don't care cause\n\n[Hook]\nSometimes I let my

Text) by\u00a0Sophocles (Ft.\u00a0F.\u00a0Storr)", "Oedipus The King (Full Text) Lyrics\n\nScene: Thebes. Before the Palace of Oedipus.\n\nSuppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,\nat their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS. To them enter OEDIPUS.\n\nOEDIPUS\nMy children, latest born to Cadmus old,\nWhy sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands\nBranches of olive filleted with wool?\nWhat means this reek of incense everywhere,\nAnd everywhere laments and litanies?\nChildren, it were not meet that I should learn\nFrom others, and am hither come, myself,\nI Oedipus, your world-renowned king.\nHo! aged sire, whose venerable locks\nProclaim thee spokesman of this company,\nExplain your mood and purport. Is it dread\nOf ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?\nMy zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;\nRuthless indeed were I and obdurate\nIf such petitioners as you I spurned.\n\nPRIEST\nYea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,\nThou seest how both extremes of age besiege\nThy palace altars\u2014fledglings hardly winged,\nand greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I\nof Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.\nMeanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs\nCrowd our two market-places, or before\nBoth shrines of Pallas congregate, or where\nIsmenus gives his oracles by fire.\nFor, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,\nSore buffeted, can no more lift her head,\nFoundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.\nA blight is on our harvest in the ear,\nA blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,\nA blight on wives in travail; and withal\nArmed with his blazing torch the God of Plague\nHath swooped upon our city emptying\nThe house of Cadmus, and the murky realm\nOf Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,\nI and these children; not as deeming thee\nA new divinity, but the first of men;\nFirst in the common accidents of life,\nAnd first in visitations of the Gods.\nArt thou not he who coming to the town\nof Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid\nTo the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received\nPrompting from us or been by others schooled;\nNo, by a god inspired (so all men deem,\nAnd testify) didst thou renew our life.\nAnd now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,\nAll we thy votaries beseech thee, find\nSome succor, whether by a voice from heaven\nWhispered, or haply known by human wit.\nTried counselors, methinks, are aptest found 1\nTo furnish for the future pregnant rede.\nUpraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!\nLook to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore\nOur country's savior thou art justly hailed:\nO never may we thus record thy reign:\u2014\n\"He raised us up only to cast us down.\"\nUplift us, build our city on a rock.\nThy happy star ascendant brought us luck,\nO let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule\nThis land, as now thou reignest, better sure\nTo rule a peopled than a desert realm.\nNor battlements nor galleys aught avail,\nIf men to man and guards to guard them tail.\n\nOEDIPUS\nAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,\nThe quest that brings you hither and your need.\nYe sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,\nHow great soever yours, outtops it all.\nYour sorrow touches each man severally,\nHim and none other, but I grieve at once\nBoth for the general and myself and you.\nTherefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.\nMany, my children, are the tears I've wept,\nAnd threaded many a maze of weary thought.\nThus pondering one clue of hope I caught,\nAnd tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus' son,\nCreon, my consort's brother, to inquire\nOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,\nHow I might save the State by act or word.\nAnd now I reckon up the tale of days\nSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.\n'Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.\nBut when he comes, then I were base indeed,\nIf I perform not all the god declares.\n\nPRIEST\nThy words are well timed; even as thou speakest\nThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.\n\nOEDIPUS\nO King Apollo! may his joyous looks\nBe presage of the joyous news he brings!\n\nPRIEST\nAs I surmise, 'tis welcome; else his head\nHad scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWe soon shall know; he's now in earshot range.\n[Enter CREON]\nMy royal cousin, say, Menoeceus' child,\nWhat message hast thou brought us from the god?\n\nCREON\nGood news, for e'en intolerable ills,\nFinding right issue, tend to naught but good.\n\nOEDIPUS\nHow runs the oracle? thus far thy words\nGive me no ground for confidence or fear.\n\nCREON\nIf thou wouldst hear my message publicly,\nI'll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.\n\nOEDIPUS\nSpeak before all; the burden that I bear\nIs more for these my subjects than myself.\n\nCREON\nLet me report then all the god declared.\nKing Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate\nA fell pollution that infests the land,\nAnd no more harbor an inveterate sore.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWhat expiation means he? What's amiss?\n\nCREON\nBanishment, or the shedding blood for blood.\nThis stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWhom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?\n\nCREON\nBefore thou didst assume the helm of State,\nThe sovereign of this land was Laius.\n\nOEDIPUS\nI heard as much, but never saw the man.\n\nCREON\nHe fell; and now the god's command is plain:\nPunish his takers-off, whoe'er they be.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWhere are they? Where in the wide world to find\nThe far, faint traces of a bygone crime?\n\nCREON\nIn this land, said the god; \"who seeks shall find;\nWho sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.\"\n\nOEDIPUS\nWas he within his palace, or afield,\nOr traveling, when Laius met his fate?\n\nCREON\nAbroad; he started, so he told us, bound\nFor Delphi, but he never thence returned.\n\nOEDIPUS\nCame there no news, no fellow-traveler\nTo give some clue that might be followed up?\n\nCREON\nBut one escape, who flying for dear life,\nCould tell of all he saw but one thing sure.\n\nOEDIPUS\nAnd what was that? One clue might lead us far,\nWith but a spark of hope to guide our quest.\n\nCREON\nRobbers, he told us, not one bandit but\nA troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.\n\nOEDIPUS\nDid any bandit dare so bold a stroke,\nUnless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?\n\nCREON\nSo 'twas surmised, but none was found to avenge\nHis murder mid the trouble that ensued.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWhat trouble can have hindered a full quest,\nWhen royalty had fallen thus miserably?\n\nCREON\nThe riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide\nThe dim past and attend to instant needs.\n\nOEDIPUS\nWell, I will start afresh and once again\nMake dark things clear. Right worthy the concern\nOf Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;\nI also, as is meet, will lend my aid\nTo avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.\nNot for some far-off kinsman, but myself,\nShall I expel this poison in the blood;\nFor whoso slew that king might have a mind\nTo strike me too with his assassin hand.\nTherefore in righting him I serve myself.\nUp, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,\nTake hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither\nThe Theban commons.

Listen then.\nMy sire was Polybus of Corinth, and\nMy mother Merope, a Dorian;\nAnd I was held the foremost citizen,\nTill a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,\nYet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.\nA roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,\nShouted \"Thou art not true son of thy sire.\"\nIt irked me, but I stomached for the nonce\nThe insult; on the morrow I sought out\nMy mother and my sire and questioned them.\nThey were indignant at the random slur\nCast on my parentage and did their best\nTo comfort me, but still the venomed barb\nRankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.\nSo privily without their leave I went\nTo Delphi, and Apollo sent me back\nBaulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.\nBut other grievous things he prophesied,\nWoes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;\nTo wit I should defile my mother's bed\nAnd raise up seed too loathsome to behold,\nAnd slay the father from whose loins I sprang.\nThen, lady,\u2014thou shalt hear the very truth\u2014\nAs I drew near the triple-branching roads,\nA herald met me and a man who sat\nIn a car drawn by colts\u2014as in thy tale\u2014\nThe man in front and the old man himself\nThreatened to thrust me rudely from the path,\nThen jostled by the charioteer in wrath\nI struck him, and the old man, seeing this,\nWatched till I passed and from his car brought down\nFull on my head the double-pointed goad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke\nOf my good staff sufficed to fling him clean\nOut of the chariot seat and laid him prone.\nAnd so I slew them every one. But if\nBetwixt this stranger there was aught in common\nWith Laius, who more miserable than I,\nWhat mortal could you find more god-abhorred?\nWretch whom no sojourner, no citizen\nMay harbor or address, whom all are bound\nTo harry from their homes. And this same curse\nWas laid on me, and laid by none but me.\nYea with these hands all gory I pollute\nThe bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?\nAm I not utterly unclean, a wretch\nDoomed to be banished, and in banishment\nForgo the sight of all my dearest ones,\nAnd never tread again my native earth;\nOr else to wed my mother and slay my sire,\nPolybus, who begat me and upreared?\nIf one should say, this is the handiwork\nOf some inhuman power, who could blame\nHis judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,\nForbid, forbid that I should see that day!\nMay I be blotted out from living men\nEre such a plague spot set on me its brand!\n\nCHORUS\nWe too, O king, are troubled; but till thou\nHast questioned the survivor, still hope on.\n\nOEDIPUS\nMy hope is faint, but still enough survives\nTo bid me bide the coming of this herd.\n\nJOCASTA\nSuppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?\n\nOEDIPUS\nI'll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees\nWith thine, I shall have 'scaped calamity.\n\nJOCASTA\nAnd what of special import did I say?\n\nOEDIPUS\nIn thy report of what the herdsman said\nLaius was slain by robbers; now if he\nStill speaks of robbers, not a robber, I\nSlew him not; \"one\" with \"many\" cannot square.\nBut if he says one lonely wayfarer,\nThe last link wanting to my guilt is forged.\n\nJOCASTA\nWell, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,\nNor can he now retract what then he said;\nNot I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.\nE'en should he vary somewhat in his story,\nHe cannot make the death of Laius\nIn any wise jump with the oracle.\nFor Loxias said expressly he was doomed\nTo die by my child's hand, but he, poor babe,\nHe shed no blood, but perished first himself.\nSo much for divination. Henceforth I\nWill look for signs neither to right nor left.\n\nOEDIPUS\nThou reasonest well. Still I would have thee send\nAnd fetch the bondsman hither. See to it.\n\nJOCASTA\nThat will I straightway. Come, let us within.\nI would do nothing that my lord mislikes.\n\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]\n\nCHORUS\n(Str. 1)\nMy lot be still to lead\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The life of innocence and fly\nIrreverence in word or deed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To follow still those laws ordained on high\nWhose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No mortal birth they own,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Olympus their progenitor alone:\nNe'er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,\nThe god in them is strong and grows not old.\n\n(Ant. 1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of insolence is bred\nThe tyrant; insolence full blown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With empty riches surfeited,\nScales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then topples o'er and lies in ruin prone;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No foothold on that dizzy steep.\nBut O may Heaven the true patriot keep\nWho burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.\nGod is my help and hope, on him I wait.\n\n(Str. 2)\nBut the proud sinner, or in word or deed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That will not Justice heed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor reverence the shrine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of images divine,\nPerdition seize his vain imaginings,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, urged by greed profane,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He grasps at ill-got gain,\nAnd lays an impious hand on holiest things.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who when such deeds are done\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can hope heaven's bolts to shun?\nIf sin like this to honor can aspire,\nWhy dance I still and lead the sacred choir?\n\n(Ant. 2)\nNo more I'll seek earth's central oracle,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or Abae's hallowed cell,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor to Olympia bring\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My votive offering.\nIf before all God's truth be not bade plain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 O Zeus, reveal thy might,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 King, if thou'rt named aright\nOmnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For Laius is forgot;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His weird, men heed it not;\nApollo is forsook and faith grows cold.\n\n[Enter JOCASTA.]\n\nJOCASTA\nMy lords, ye look amazed to see your queen\nWith wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.\nI had a mind to visit the high shrines,\nFor Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed\nWith terrors manifold.

I reck not how Fate deals with me\nBut my unhappy children\u2014for my sons\nBe not concerned, O Creon, they are men,\nAnd for themselves, where'er they be, can fend.\nBut for my daughters twain, poor innocent maids,\nWho ever sat beside me at the board\nSharing my viands, drinking of my cup,\nFor them, I pray thee, care, and, if thou willst,\nO might I feel their touch and make my moan.\nHear me, O prince, my noble-hearted prince!\nCould I but blindly touch them with my hands\nI'd think they still were mine, as when I saw.\n[ANTIGONE and ISMENE are led in.]\nWhat say I? can it be my pretty ones\nWhose sobs I hear?

It didn\u2019t matter that there had been a body. It didn\u2019t matter that there had been a funeral. They were so badly burned, not even dental records helped for identification. So there was still a sliver of hope. It wasn\u2019t her, it wasn\u2019t her, Joaquin prayed. Even as all the mourners shook his hand and mumbled condolences, he prayed. Because nothing about Aurora\u2019s existence was ever normal, and her death would be no exception.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until he went completely numb from the agony that he remembered that even though the room across the hall was empty, so was the bed next to him. In those moments, the guilt struck him in the stomach like a blade. How could he obsess over his (presumably) missing daughter when his own wife had perished in the crash? But he hardly remembered that he\u2019d been the one at the coroner\u2019s to say it was definitely Alma. That day was so burned into his mind, it often glowed with a blinding haze and only came back in fragments.\nEvery night, he saw her in the corner of his room, telling him she was okay. But every time he reached out for her, she was gone. He would turn to his empty side of the bed and grieve Alma instead. His sweet, sweet Alma, he knew, was gone. That much was the truth and he clung to it in desperation, her pillow in one hand and the empty bottle of bourbon in the other. He lay in a pool of his cold sweats, unable to feel.\nThe night he dreamt about Alma, however, turned into the day he finally did something about Aurora. In his rare but fitful sleep, she begged him to keep the promise he\u2019d once made her and not let their daughter go. She\u2019d sweetly kissed his cheek and cupped his face, whispering one last sweet nothing and then evaporating before him.  He awoke invigorated by the sun he finally let in from the windows at 5 AM and practically leaped into the shower. Once he dressed and refueled with coffee, his weaker substitute for bourbon, he ripped open his laptop and started running through his old contacts from the war. Most were in different time zones, so he caught some finishing up dinner, others headed to work. But all his comrades offered the same answer: \u201cOf course, brother. Anything you need.\u201d\n***\n\u201cPromise me something,\u201d Alma proposed one night, her voice soft as a cloud as to not stir tiny Aurora. She lay next to the sleeping baby in bed, a bundle smaller than a pillow, and dragged a finger over the valleys and peaks of her little face.\n\u201cHmm? What is it?\u201d Joaquin had drifted off in the rocking chair and woke abruptly. He rubbed one eye, sniffing as he realized he\u2019d already been dreaming. Alma\u2019s silhouette came into focus on the bed in front of him and she was watching Aurora sleep in such awe, he thought Alma was in shock. He froze at the sight.\n\u201cPromise me if anything ever happens to me, you\u2019ll tell her. You\u2019ll tell her what we found out. She deserves to know,\u201d she said sadly, as if she knew already. That she would not be the one to tell her daughter the truth about her origins. She still shivered in her nightgown at the thought of the ominous, cloaked figure at her door just weeks ago. They\u2019d made a deal with the devil, it\u2019d seemed like. But desperation will drive you to drastic decisions.\n\u201cWhat will she think of us, Alma?\u201d he asked, his biggest fear leaking through his sleep. His palms began to sweat on the arms of the chair, his anxiety stirring him awake once more. He opened his crusty eyes, suddenly paranoid that they were gone. But Alma had peacefully slipped into her own slumber, one hand placed softly on her newborn daughter\u2019s stomach. \u201cShe\u2019ll never forgive us,\u201d he mumbled to himself as he felt his head falling back against the chair again.\n***\nThe rattling in the child's hands started click-clacking in her head. She envisioned taking that delicate wrist and twisting the arm one way and the hand the other. Like an old rag.  Even imagined the little snap her bone would make. The silencing of it all twitched her hand and she reached, the pale new skin of the infant so close she felt the heat of her blood underneath. When her fingers had a steady grip, she squeezed and closed her eyes.\nWhen they opened again, all she saw was clear sapphire and she gasped. Mistaking it for the ocean, her body shook, determining its next move for survival. It's the sky, she thought. Sighing, her surroundings began to come into focus. That stupid rattling was still in her ears. Her reality had sunk into a dream, and when she tried to sit up, it was hard to tell what was anything was. The blue blended into this tan landscape and she disappeared right into it. It's a desert, she realized. How in the hell did I get here? Before that registered, her eyes caught movement near her foot, finding the source of the rattling. Shit, no! Both her feet peddled against the ground furiously, moving her backwards, shaking up a sand storm. A rattlesnake was an inch away and as she scrambled, its tail swept across like a windshield wiper and landed directly on her calf.\nThe instant contact sent the ripple of trembling on her skin racing towards her brain. It felt a cigarette burn drilling into her leg. She yelped, and falling back into some branches, she reached for the closest one and swung it at the snake. It retracted, having met its victim and slunk away. But her leg throbbed, impossibly hotter than the air around her. Aurora wheezed, her lungs expelling the sand she'd whirled into the air. How the hell did I end up here? And where is here?\n***\nJewel clutched the flowers tightly, feeling one of the thorns cutting through the plastic into her own hand. She bit her lip, but kept her stride. They crinkled in her grip, the only sound in the whole graveyard. She strolled the familiar path to the tombstone, beginning a dull fade in the grass where she\u2019s made the trip endless times. The leaves were starting to scatter the graves, every shade of crimson and auburn imaginable. 16 years later and she couldn\u2019t forgive her mother, but she couldn\u2019t stay away. Most mornings she still woke up in denial and went back to bed at night hating her all over again.\nOnce the obligatory bouquet was placed on a grey stone with the name she cringed at, she took out the second bouquet from the bag slung over her shoulder and made her way to Twyla\u2019s grave. Here, her breath always shook a little, but it had been easier to say goodbye. She mumbled hello and pleasantries of the morning to her best friend, laying down the flowers from her own garden. Twyla had heard it all: her twins growing up and becoming teenagers, the day Aiden decided he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, and her own solitude she purged her soul with. Her mother\u2019s betrayal had ended in both of their deaths, and Jewel was left with three babies (which included Twyla\u2019s orphan). Her phone buzzed in her pocket and she figured it was her twins\u2019 check-in call from the school across the country they attended. It can wait, she thought. I still have lots to share with her today. Rose\u2019s caf\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t open for another hour and she\u2019d have plenty of time to walk the three blocks.\nLunenburg, a small port town, was intimate and quaint, and despite the fact that everyone knew each other, they all respected their privacy. But it was hard to ignore the sympathetic buzz from the patrons gossiping about her life. An abandoned single mother who took over her mother\u2019s bistro after she was killed by a stranger led a sad life indeed. Not to mention, she\u2019d let her best friend\u2019s baby be kidnapped shortly after her birth\u2026\nBut when the phone buzzed for the third time, Jewel was alert again. She pulled it out and stared at the number, her eyebrows crinkling. She didn\u2019t recognize the number. It\u2019s probably the kids. Her lavender eyes scanned the horizon of the bay nearby as she tucked the phone behind her light brown curls.\n\u201cHello?\u201d she answered with a hole forming in her stomach.\n\u201cHi, my name is Joaquin. I need to speak with Jewel immediately,\u201d a man\u2019s voice echoed with urgency. Her hand holding the phone up to her ear shook with surprise. She cleared her throat.\n\u201cYes, this is she. What is this regarding?\u201d Oh god, it\u2019s my kids. Something\u2019s happened.\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather not discuss this over the phone. Please, could we meet in person? It\u2019s urgent,\u201d the man insisted in a hushed whisper now, desperation leaking through the phone.\n\u201cHow did you get this number? Why would I agree to meet someone just out of the blue like this? You need to tell me what this is about,\u201d she stated, anger fortifying her authority.\n\u201cJewel, please,\u201d he begged, using her name intimately, as if they known each other forever. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s about Twyla. We need to talk. Something\u2019s happened to her daughter.\u201d Her eyes darted to the grave she was standing in front of, and hearing someone say her name out loud froze her blood. The last thing she heard was the phone clattering on the tombstone, her arm still raised in shock.\n***\nJoaquin\u2019s efforts had been in vain the last three months. He\u2019d gathered all his resources and none of the intel he received got him any closer. He sat at the dining table, his hands in his hair, on the verge of pulling out of every follicle he had. Goddamit, someone must know something. There had to be something he\u2019d missed. As he rubbed his face in exhaustion, he felt the cheekbones protruding from the skin. The search had taken a toll on him, and he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d slept. He stared hopelessly at the disarray of papers in front of him. They had his manic handwriting all over them, each line a clue, question, idea, or detail. A small knock at his door snapped him back to the apartment.\nHe groaned as he got up, and swung the door open to find Jewel standing there with multiple tupper ware containers in her hands. She was beaming under her thick parka, her cheeks flushed with the cold. Joaquin couldn\u2019t help but smile, his burden evaporating for a moment.\n\u201cHi, Jewel,\u201d he greeted weakly, taking a couple tubs out of her hands as he pecked her on the cheek. She stepped inside, bending down to remove her snow-covered boots in the entrance. When did she make herself so at home here? Why does she insist on the three-hour drive to check on me?\n\u201cJoaquin, it\u2019s seven in the morning and you look like you haven\u2019t even gone to bed yet,\u201d she reprimanded as she hung her parka on a hook behind the door. He was in an old t-shirt and pajama pants, while she stood with her hands on her hips wearing a long-sleeved thermal shirt and jeans.\n\u201cThere were too many things on my mind,\u201d he shrugged, one hand scratching his temple.\n\u201cWell, you should at least eat something. Go sit down,\u201d she ordered, already putting on a pot of coffee in the kitchen. Joaquin dragged his feet to the couch, hearing a carton being taken out of the fridge. Soon, the sizzling of eggs and roasting coffee beans made his mouth water. He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d fallen asleep until the hot plate was in his lap and she startled him.\n\u201cSorry. Eat up,\u201d she cheerfully stated. As he chewed, she sat opposite him, clasped her hands and waited. Jewel pursed her lips, trying to hold in the news until he was done. She took a quick survey of the room and besides the mountain of papers on the dining table, it still looked clean. Not like the first time she\u2019d come in months ago, where she had to step around liquor bottles and wonder if she\u2019d fallen into some drunk\u2019s trap.\nBut he\u2019d known everything about Twyla, down to the day she helped Jewel give birth. He\u2019d found a trail she didn\u2019t even know existed. When she met Joaquin, she saw how tortured he was by the most important path he just couldn\u2019t find. Aurora. They connected the dots from the moment she was snatched from Jewel\u2019s arms and delivered into Joaquin\u2019s. Despite that darkness, she couldn\u2019t believe how perfect the name was for her and Jewel smiled at the thought of that little baby growing up. But she was a dying flame, fading faster every day.\nOnce Joaquin finished his breakfast, Jewel pulled a notebook out of her purse. Wordlessly, she handed it to him. Puzzled, he ran his callused fingers along the frozen spiral and tanned leather cover. She smiled with a secret on her lips and she nodded for him to open it. His jaw dropped as she revealed to him the last piece of the puzzle. Joaquin stood suddenly and kneeled in front of Jewel, who watched with softness. He cried into her shoulder, having finally found an ally in his immense sorrow.\n***\nThe old mansion was still there, just as Twyla had described it some 20 years ago. It had taken Jewel months to track down all of Twyla\u2019s belongings she had sorted after her death. But sifting through old boxes of her old stuff had awoken a purpose in her again. And it gave her more and more to tell Twyla when she felt lonely. Everyone from Twyla\u2019s time was gone or scattered and before, she didn\u2019t do well alone. But she was alone in her car the day she watched Joaquin lead a group of his old war friends on a raid in the middle of the night. They\u2019d argued about her presence there at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous! You don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll run into!\u201d he screamed, throwing his hands in the air. They\u2019d resorted to fighting about what to do next after finding the notebook.\n\u201cThis is my story now, too, Joaquin! It was from the moment you called me. I owe it to her, to both of them,\u201d she said softly at the end of her rant. She was 20 when Twyla died, and whenever she brought her up, Jewel shrunk back into that lost young woman with those amethyst eyes. Joaquin\u2019s hair was graying, the veins in his hand popping out with age and he sighed as she played that card again. Finally, he huffed.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll watch from far away. We\u2019re going in three days from now.\u201d\nIn the dark, Jewel squinted at the figures sprinting towards the abandoned house. They ran in perfect formation effortlessly, despite their collective age and she admired their stealth as they disappeared into the darkness, invisible now to her eyes. Her legs shook impatiently as the mansion in the middle of the woods was overtaken.\n***\nJoaquin had rushed the front door, made of stained glass, knocking off the lock with a small battering ram with Nichols and Jones. Their feet had scrambled on the impeccable tile in the foyer and their element of surprise was quickly fading. But the limited range of vision from his night vision goggles didn\u2019t reveal the lack of furniture right away.\n\u201cClear! \u2026 Clear!\u201d he heard Linus and Milton shout from the hallway, coming towards them from the back of the house. He heard Thanes mutter \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d as they surveyed the ground floor. Besides a grand set of stairs to the right of the front door, the house was one large room, contradicting the blueprints they\u2019d studied for days. The goggles came off as the tile was illuminated by moonlight as the five men with military weapons were suddenly walking in circles in the room. Removing their masks, they found nothing but walls and a small hallway leading to the back entrance.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t it, look! The wall, it ends here but the exterior of the house keeps going,\u201d Jones excitedly ventured, running his hands along the east wall, opposite from the staircase. It was made of grey, stone bricks. With a light kick to a brick near the floor, Jones exclaimed \u201cShit!\u201d as a piece of the wall shifted into an opening. The men raised their guns in instinct as a light emerged from the entry. Joaquin rushed towards the hidden room, Thanes on his six to cover.\nIn the center of the room, alight with floodlights from the ceiling, was a duel in combat. Their slaps echoed against the stone and both figures cloaked in black zoomed around each other. Joaquin caught sight of the man he\u2019d seen only before, 16 years before in the dead of night at his doorstep. The man\u2019s blanche face watched the fight uninterested, but turned at the unexpected visitors. His jet black hair flowed behind him and Joaquin detected almost a crack of a smile on the man\u2019s face at recognizing him. That smug bastard.\nJoaquin didn\u2019t hesitate and pointed his long range weapon straight at his temple. The men followed suit, unaware of who he was.\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he yelled in ire, with more anger in him than when he\u2019d killed in the war. Surprised by the interruption, the two combatants ceased and stood in a defensive pose. Three of Joaquin\u2019s men pointed at them instead as he and Thanes stayed trained on the pale man. The silence was broken by one of the fighters, who stumbled forward quickly and ripped off the black cloth mask on their face. In one fell swoop, the guns pointed to the floor in shock as a mane of coffee-colored hair flew out of the cover.\n\u201cDad?\u201d Joaquin heard from his left, his fury blurring his vision. But when he turned, a pair of sharp sapphire eyes pierced him. His lungs flattened in his chest as he saw Aurora\u2019s face staring back at him. My God, what\u2019s happened to her?  Even in her black suit of combat, he could turn she was toned and stronger. Her face had lost its baby fat and he swallowed in disbelief.\n\u201cIf you and your men put down your weapons, we\u2019ll gladly explain everything,\u201d the man behind him offered. Joaquin didn\u2019t register it. He could only stare at her. But when her gaze went past him to the man, Joaquin turned and surveyed the situation he was now in. He lifted his chin to Thanes and Linus and nodded towards the man.\n\u201cSubdue him, now,\u201d he said calmly. Joaquin heard a scuffle as the two took him down, but he turned back to Aurora, now approaching her slowly. She was in as much astonishment as he.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here now,\u201d he comforted quickly, holding out a cautious hand to her. She stared at it in doubt. Aurora shook her head vigorously.\n\u201cNo. You shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d she spoke for the first time, her voice almost deeper than he remembered. He furrowed his eyebrows as he caught a glimpse of Jones and Milton tying up the other fighter. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstand what? Aurora, I\u2019m here to take you home,\u201d he reassured her, laying his weapon down.\n\u201cDad, there\u2019s a lot to talk about. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m here. There\u2019s a reason I was captured the day Mom died,\u201d she said in the calmest voice he\u2019d ever heard.\n\u201cAurora, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he probed, feeling a buzz of tension in the room. She was different, and at his question, she seemed too tired to answer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me, and I\u2019ll explain it all,\u201d she said and sighed as she shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong. This was the only way I\u2019d be safe.\u201d She looked straight at him and he felt her summing up how he\u2019d take what she said next.\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to exist.\u201d", "http://genius.com/Jessy-r-the-lies-weve-told-rough-draft-annotated"], "522619": ["Cuchulain of Muirthemne -  XX. Death of Cuchulain by\u00a0Lady\u00a0Augusta Gregory", "Cuchulain of Muirthemne -  XX. Death of Cuchulain Lyrics\n\nXX.\n\nDEATH OF CUCHULAIN\n\nCUCHULAIN went on then to the house of his mother, Dechtire, to bid her farewell. And she came out on the lawn to meet him, for she knew well he was going out to face the men of Ireland, and she brought out wine in a vessel to him, as her custom was when he passed that way. But when he took the vessel in his hand, it was red blood that was in it. \"My grief!\" he said, \"my mother Dechtire, it is no wonder others to forsake me, when you yourself offer me a drink of blood.\" Then she filled the vessel a second, and a third tune, and each time when she gave it to him, there was nothing in it but blood.\n\nThen anger came on Cuchulain, and he dashed the vessel against a rock, and broke it, and he said: \"The fault is not in yourself, my mother Dechtire, but my luck is turned against me, and my life is near its end, and I will not come back alive this time from facing the men of Ireland.\" Then Dechtire tried hard to persuade him to go back and to wait till he would have the help of Conall. \"I will not wait,\" he said, \"for anything you can say; for I would not give up my great name and my courage for all the riches of the world. And from the day I first took arms till this day, I have never drawn back from a fight or a battle. And it is not now I will begin to draw back,\" he said, \"for a great name outlasts life.\"\n\nThen he went on his way, and Cathbad, that had followed him, went with him. And presently they came to a ford, and there they saw a young girl, thin and white-skinned and having yellow hair, washing and ever washing, and wringing out clothing that was stained crimson red, and she crying and keening all the time. \"Little Hound,\" said Cathbad, \"do you see what it is that young girl is doing? It is your red clothes she is washing, and crying as she washes, because she knows you are going to your death against Maeve's great army. And take the warning now and turn back again.\" \"Dear master,\" said Cuchulain, \"you have followed me far enough; for I will not turn back from my vengeance on the men of Ireland that are come to burn and to destroy my house and my country. And what is it to me, the woman of the Sidhe to be washing red clothing for me? It is not long till there will be clothing enough, and armour and aims, lying soaked in pools of blood, by my own sword and my spear. And if you are sorry and loth to let me go into the fight, I am glad and ready enough myself to go into it, though I know as well as you yourself I must fall in it. Do not be hindering me any more, then,\" he said, \"for, if I stay or if I go, death will meet me all the same. But go now to Emain, to Conchubar and to Emer, and bring them life and health from me, for I will never go back to meet them again. It is my grief and my wound, I to part from them! And O Laeg!\" he said, \"we are going away under trouble and under darkness from Emer now, as it is often we came back to her with gladness out of strange places and far countries.\"\n\nThen Cathbad left him, and he went on his way. And after a while he saw three hags, and they blind of the left eye, before him in the mad, and they having a venomous hound they were cooking with charms on rods of the rowan tree. And he was going by them, for he knew it was not for his good they were there.\n\nBut one of the hags called to him: \"Stop a while with us, Cuchulain.\" \"I will not stop with you,\" said Cuchulain. \"That is because we have nothing better than a dog to give you,\" said the hag. \"If we had a grand, big cooking-hearth, you would stop and visit us; but because it is only a little we have to offer you, you will not stop. But he that will not show respect for the small, though he is great, he will get no respect himself.\"\n\nThen he went over to her, and she gave him the shoulder-blade of the hound out of her left hand, and he ate it out of his left hand. And he put it down on his left thigh, and the hand that took it was struck down, and the thigh he put it on was struck through and through, so that the strength that was in them before left them.\n\nThen he went dawn the road of Meadhon-Luachair, by Slieve Fuad, and his enemy, Erc, son of Cairbre, saw him in the chariot, and his sword shining red in his hand, and the light of his courage plain upon him, and his hair spread out like threads of gold that change their colour on the edge of the anvil under the smith's band, and the Crow of Battle in the air over his head.\n\n\"Cuchulain is coming at us,\" said Erc to the men of Ireland, \"and let us be ready for him.\" So they made a fence of shields linked together, and Erc put a couple of the men that were strongest here and there, to let on to be fighting one another, that they might call Cuchulain to them; and he put a Druid with every couple of them, and he bid the Druid to ask Cuchulain's spears of him, for it would be hard for him to refuse a Druid. For it was in the prophecy of the children of Calatin that a king would be killed by each one of those spears in that battle.\n\nAnd he bid the men of Ireland to give out shouts, and Cuchulain came against them in his chariot, doing his three thunder feats, and he used his spear and his sword in such a way, that their heads, and their hands, and their feet, and their bones, were scattered through the plain of Muirthemne; like the sands on the shore, like the stars in the sky, like the dew in May, like snow-flakes and hailstones, like leaves of the trees, like buttercups in a meadow, like grass under the feet of cattle on a fine summer day. It is red that plain was with the slaughter Cuchulain made when he came crashing over it.\n\nThen he saw one of the men that was put to quarrel with the other, and the Druid called to him to come and hinder them, and Cuchulain leaped towards them. \"Your spear to me,\" cried the Druid. \"I swear by the oath of my people,\" said Cuchulain, \"you are not so much in want of it as I am in want of it myself. The men of Ireland are upon me,\" he said, \"and I am upon them.\" \"I will put a bad name on you if you refuse it to me,\" said the Druid. \"There was never a bad name put on me yet, on account of any refusal of mine,\" said Cuchulain, and with that he threw the spear at him, and it went through his head, and it killed the men that were on the other side of him.\n\nThen Cuchulain drove through the host, and Lugaid, son of Curoi, got the spear. \"Who is it will fall by this spear, children of Calatin?\" said Lugaid. \"A king will fall by it,\" said they. Then Lugaid threw the spear at Cuchulain's chariot, and it went through and hit the driver, Laeg, son of Riangabra, and he fell back, and his bowels came out on the cushions of the chariot \"My grief!\" said Laeg, \"it is hard I am wounded.\" Then Cuchulain drew the spear out, and Laeg said his farewell to him, and Cuchulain said: \"To-day I will be a fighter and a chariot-driver as well.\"\n\nThen he saw the other two men that were put to quarrel with one another, and one of them called out it would be a great shame for him not to give him his help. Then Cuchulain leaped towards them. \"Your spear to me, Cuchulain,\" said the Druid. \"I swear by the oath my people swear by,\" said he, \"you are not in such want of the spear as I am myself, for it is by my courage, and by my arms, that I have to drive out the four provinces of Ireland that are sweeping over Muirthemne to-day.\" \"I will put a bad name upon you,\" said the Druid. \"I am not bound to give more than one gift in the day, and I have paid what is due to my name already,\" said Cuchulain. Then the Druid said: \"I will put a bad name on the province of Ulster, because of your refusal.\"\n\n\"Ulster was never dispraised yet for any refusal of mine,\" said Cuchulain, \"or for anything I did unworthily. Though little of my life should be left to me, Ulster will not be reproached for me to-day.\" With that he threw his spear at him, and it went through his head, and through the heads of the nine men that were behind him, and Cuchulain went through the host as he did before.\n\nThen Erc, son of Cairbre Niafer, took up his spear. \"Who will fall by this?\" he asked the children of Calatin. \"A king will fall by it,\" they said. \"I heard you say the same thing of the spear that Lugaid threw a while ago,\" said Erc. \"That is true,\" said they, \"and the king of the chariot-drivers of Ireland fell by it, Cuchulain's driver Laeg, son of Riangabra.\"\n\nWith that, Erc threw the spear, and it went through the Grey of Macha. Cuchulain drew the spear out, and they said farewell to one another. And then the Grey went away from him, with half his harness hanging from his neck, and he went into Glas-linn, the grey pool in Slieve Fuad.\n\nThen Cuchulain drove through the host, and he saw the third couple disputing together, and he went between them as he did before. And the Druid asked his spear of him, but he refused him. \"I will put a bad name on you,\" said the Druid. \"I have paid what is due to my name to-day,\" said he; \"my honour does not bind me to give more than one request in a day.\" \"I will put a bad name upon Ulster because of your refusal\" \"I have paid what is due for the honour of Ulster,\" said Cuchulain. \"Then I will put a bad name on your kindred,\" said the Druid. \"The news that I have been given a bad name shall never go back to that place I am never to go back to myself; for it is little of my life that is left to me,\" said Cuchulain. With that he threw his spear at him, and it went through him, and through the heads of the men that were along with him.\n\n\"You do your kindness unkindly, Cuchulain,\" said the Druid, as he fell. Then Cuchulain drove for the last time through the host, and Lugaid took the spear, and he said: \"Who will fall by this spear, children of Calatin?\" \"A king will fall by it,\" said they. \"I heard you saying that a king would fall by the spear Erc threw a while ago.\" \"That is true,\" they said, \"and the Grey of Macha fell by it, that was the king of the horses of Ireland\".\n\nThen Lugaid threw the spear, and it went through and through Cuchulain's body, and he knew he had got his deadly wound; and his bowels came out on the cushions of the chariot, and his only horse went away from him, the Black Sainglain, with half the harness hanging from his neck, and left his master, the king of the heroes of Ireland, to die upon the plain of Muirthemne.\n\nThen Cuchulain said: \"There is great desire on me to go to that lake beyond, and to get a drink from it.\"\n\n\"We will give you leave to do that,\" they said, \"if you will come back to us after.\"\n\n\"I will bid you come for me if I am not able to come back myself,\" said Cuchulain.\n\nThen he gathered up his bowels into his body, and he went down to the lake. He drank a drink and he washed himself, and he returned back again to his death, and he called to his enemies to come and meet him.\n\nThere was a pillar-stone west of the lake, and his eye lit on it, and he went to the pillar-stone, and he tied himself to it with his breast-belt, the way he would not meet his death lying down, but would meet it standing up. Then his enemies came round about him, but they were in dread of going close to him, for they were not sure but he might be still alive.\n\n\"It is a great shame for you,\" said Erc, son of Cairbre, \"not to strike the head off that man, in revenge for his striking the head off my father.\"\n\nThen the Grey of Macha came back to defend Cuchulain as long as there was life in him, and the hero-light was shining above him. And the Grey of Macha made three attacks against them, and he killed fifty men with his teeth, and thirty with each of his hoofs. So there is a saying: \"It is not sharper work than this was done by the Grey of Macha, the time of Cuchulain's death.\"\n\nThen a bird came and settled on his shoulder. \"It is not on that pillar birds were used to settle,\" said Erc.\n\nThen Lugaid came and lifted up Cuchulain's hair from his shoulders, and struck his head off, and the men of Ireland gave three heavy shouts, and the sword fell from Cuchulain's hand, and as it fell, it struck off Lugaid's right hand, so that it fell to the ground. Then they cut off Cuchulain's hand, in satisfaction for it, and then the light faded away from about Cuchulain's head, and left it as pale as the snow of a single night. Then all the men of Ireland said that as it was Maeve had gathered the army, it would be right for her to bring away the head to Cruachan. \"I will not bring it with me; it is for Lugaid that struck it off to bring it with him,\" said Maeve. And then Lugaid and his men went away, and they brought away Cuchulain's head and his right hand with them, and they went south, towards the Lif\u00e9 river.\n\nAt that time the army of Ulster was gathering to attack its enemies, and Conall was out before them, and he met the Grey of Macha, and his share of blood dripping from him. And then he knew that Cuchulain was dead, and himself and the Grey of Macha went looking for Cuchulain's body. And when they saw his body at the pillar-stone, the Grey of Macha went and laid his head in Cuchulain's breast: \"That body is a heavy care to the Grey of Macha,\" said Conall.\n\nThen Conall went after the army, thinking in his own mind what way he could get satisfaction for Cuchulain's death. For it was a promise between himself and Cuchulain that whichever of them would be killed the first, the other would get satisfaction for his death.\n\n\"And if I am the first that is killed,\" said Cuchulain at that time, \"how long will it be before you get satisfaction for me?\"\n\n\"Before the evening of the same day,\" said Conall, \"I will have got satisfaction for you. And if it is I that will die before you,\" he said, \"how long will it be before you get satisfaction for me?\"\n\n\"Your share of blood will not be cold on the ground,\" said Cuchulain, \"when I will have got satisfaction for you.\"\n\nSo Conall followed after Lugaid to the river Lif\u00e9.\n\nLugaid was going down to bathe in the water, but he said to his chariot-driver: \"Look out there over the plain, for fear would any one come at us unknown.\"\n\nThe chariot-driver looked around him. \"There is a man coming on us,\" he said, \"and it is in a great hurry he is coming; and you would think he has all the ravens in Ireland flying over his head, and there are flakes of snow speckling the ground before him.\"\n\n\"It is not in friendship the man comes that is coming like that,\" said Lugaid. \"It is Conall Cearnach it is, with Dub-dearg, and the birds that you see after him, they are the sods the horse has scattered in the air from his hoofs, and the flakes of snow that are speckling the ground before him, they are the froth that he scatters from his mouth and from the bit of his bridle. Look again,\" said Lugaid, \"and see what way is he coming.\" \"It is to the ford he is coming, the same way the army passed over,\" said the chariot-driver. \"Let him pass by us,\" said Lugaid, \"for I have no mind to fight with him.\"\n\nBut when Conall came to the middle of the ford, he saw Lugaid and his chariot-driver, and he went over to them. \"Welcome is the sight of a debtor's face,\" said Conall. \"The man you owe a debt to is asking payment of you now, and I myself am that man,\" he said, \"for the sake of my comrade, Cuchulain, that you killed. And I am standing here now, to get that debt paid.\"\n\nThey agreed then to fight it out on the plain of Magh Argetnas, and in the fight Conall wounded Lugaid with his spear. From that they went to a place called Ferta Lugdac. \"I would like that you would give me fair play,\" said Lugaid. \"What fair play?\" said Conall Cearnach.\n\n\"That you and I should fight with one hand,\" said he, \"for I have the use of but one hand.\"\n\n\"I will do that,\" said Conan. Then Conall's hand was bound to his side with a cord, and then they fought for a long time, and one did not get the better of the other. And when Conall was not gaining on him, his horse, Dub-dearg, that was near by, came up to Lugaid, and took a bite out of his side.\n\n\"Misfortune on me,\" said Lugaid, \"it is not right or fair that is of you, Conall.\"\n\n\"It was for myself to do what is right and fair,\" said Conall.\n\n\"I made no promise for a beast, that is without training and without sense.\"\n\n\"It is well I know you will not leave me till you take my head, as I took Cuchulain's head from him,\" said Lugaid. \"Take it, then, along with your own head. Put my kingdom with your kingdom, and my courage with your courage; for I would like that you would be the best champion in Ireland.\"\n\nThen Conall made an end of him, and he went back, bringing Cuchulain's head along with him to the pillar stone where his body was.\n\nAnd by that time Emer had get word of all that had happened, and that her husband had got his death by the men of Ireland, and by the powers of the children of Calatin. And it was Levarcham brought her the story, for Conall Cearnach had met her on his way, and had bade her go and bring the news to Emain Macha; and there she found Emer, and she sitting in her upper room, looking over the plain for some word from the battle.\n\nAnd all the women came out to meet Levarcham, and when they heard her story, they made an outcry of grief and sharp cries, with loud weeping and burning tears; and there were long dismal sounds going through Emain, and the whole country round was filled with crying. And Emer and her women went to the place where Cuchulain's body was, and they gathered round it there, and gave themselves to crying and keening.\n\nAnd when Conall came back to the place, he laid the head with the body of Cuchulain, and he began to lament along with them, and it is what he said: \"It is Cuchulain had prosperity on him, a root of valour from the time he was but a soft child; there never fell a better hero than the hero that fell by Lugaid of the Lands. And there are many are in want of you,\" he said, \"and until all the chief men of Ireland have fallen by me, it is not fitting there should ever be peace.\n\n\"It is grief to me, he to have gone into the battle without Conall being at his side; it was a pity for him to go there without my body beside his body. Och! it is he was my foster-son, and now the ravens are drinking his blood; there will not be either laughter or mirth, since the Hound has gone astray from us.\"\n\n\"Let us bury Cuchulain now,\" said Emer. \"It is not right to do that,\" said Conall, \"until I have avenged him on the men of Ireland. And it is a great shouting I hear about the plain of Muirthemne, and it is full the country is of crying after Cuchulain; and it is good at keeping the country and watching the boundaries the man was that is here before me, a cross-hacked body in a pool of blood. And it is well it pleased Lugaid, son of Curoi, to be at the killing of Cuchulain, for it was Cuchulain killed the chiefs and the children of Deaguid round Famain, son of Foraoi, and round Curoi, son of Daire himself. And this shouting has taken away my wits and my memory from me,\" he said, \"and it is hard for me, Cuchulain not to answer these cries, and I to be without him now; for there is not a champion in Ireland that was not in dread of the sword in his hand. And it is broken in halves my heart is for my brother, and I will bring my revenge through Ireland now, and I will not leave a tribe without wounding, or true blood without spilling, and the whole world will be told of my rout to the end of life and time, until the men of Munster and Connaught and Leinster will be crying for the rising they made against him. And without the spells of the children of Calatin, the whole of them would not have been able to do him to death.\"\n\nAfter that complaint, rage and madness came on Conall, and he went forward in his chariot to follow after the rest of the men of Ireland, the same way as he had followed after Lugaid.\n\nAnd Emer took the head of Cuchulain in her hands, and she washed it clean, and put a silk cloth about it, and she held it to her breast; and she began to cry heavily over it, and it is what she said:\n\n\"Ochone!\" said she, \"it is good the beauty of this head was, though it is low this day, and it is many of the kings and princes of the world would be keening it if they knew the way it is now, and the poets and the Druids of Ireland and of Alban; and many were the goods and the jewels and the rents and the tributes that you brought home to me from the countries of the world, with the courage and the strength of your hands!\"\n\nAnd she made this complaint:\n\n\"Och, head! Ochone, O head! you gave death to great heroes, to many hundreds; my head will lie in the same grave, the one Stone will be made for both of us.\n\n\"Och, hand! Ochone, hand that was once gentle. It is often it was put under my head; it is dear that hand was to me!\n\n\"Dear mouth! Ochone, kind mouth that was sweet-voiced telling stories; since the time love first came on your face, you never refused either weak or strong!\n\n\"Dear the man, dear the man, that would kill the whole of a great host; dear his cold bright hair, and dear his bright cheeks!\n\n\"Dear the king, dear the king, that never gave a refusal to any; thirty days it is to-night since my body lay beside your body.\n\n\"Och, two spears! Ochone, two spears, Och, shield! Och, deadly sword! Let them be given to Conall of the battles; there was never any wage given like that.\n\n\"I am glad, I am glad, Cuchulain of Muirthemne, I never brought red shame on your face, for any unfaithfulness against you.\n\n\"Happy are they, happy are they, who will never hear the cuckoo again for ever, now that the Hound has died from us.\n\n\"I am carried away like a branch on the stream; I will not bind up my hair to-day. From this day I have nothing to say that is better than Ochone!\"\n\nAnd then she said: \"It is long that it was showed to me in a vision of the night, that Cuchulain would fall by the men of Ireland, and it appeared to me Dundealgan to be falling to the ground, and his shield to be split from lip to border, and his sword and his spears broken in the middle, and I saw Conall doing deeds of death before me, and myself and yourself in the one death. And oh! my love,\" she said, \"we were often in one another's company, and it was happy for us; for if the world had been searched from the rising of the sun to sunset, the like would never have been found in one place, of the Black Sainglain and the Grey of Macha, and Laeg the chariot-driver, and myself and Cuchulain. And it is breaking my heart is in my body, to be listening to the pity and the sorrowing of women and men, and the harsh crying of the young men of Ulster keening Cuchulain, and Ulster to be in its weakness, and without strength to revenge itself upon the men of Ireland.\"\n\nAnd after she made that complaint, she brought Cuchulain's body to Dundealgan; and they all cried and keened about him until such time as Conall Cearnach came back from making his red rout through the army of the men of Ireland.\n\nFor he was not satisfied to make a slaughter of the men of Munster and Connaught, without reddening his hand in the blood of Leinster as well.\n\nAnd when he had done that, he came to Dundealgan, and his men along with him, but they made no rejoicing when they went back that time. And he brought the heads of the men of Ireland along with him in a gad, and he laid them out on the green lawn, and the people of the house gave three great shouts when they saw the heads.\n\nAnd Emer came out, and when she saw Conall Cearnach, she said: \"My great esteem and my welcome before you, king of heroes, and may your many wounds not be your death; for you have avenged the treachery done on Ulster, and now what you have to do is to make our grave, and to lay us together in the grave, for I will not live after Cuchulain.\n\n\"And tell me, Conall,\" she said, \"whose are those heads all around on the lawn, and which of the great men of Ireland did they belong to?\"\n\nAnd she was asking, and Conall was answering, and it is what she said:\n\n\"Tell me, Conall, whose are those heads, for surely you have reddened your arms with them. Tell me the names of the men whose heads are there upon the ground.\"\n\nAnd Conall said: \"Daughter of Forgall of the Horses, young Emer of the sweet words, it is in revenge for the Hound of Feats I brought these heads here from the south.\"\n\n\"Whose is the great black head, with the smooth cheek redder than a rose; it is at the far end, on the left side, the head that has not changed its colour?\"\n\n\"It is the head of the king of Meath, Erc, son of Cairbre of Swift Horses; I brought his head with me from far off, in revenge for my own foster-son.\"\n\n\"Whose is that head there before me, with soft hair, with smooth eyebrows, its eyes like ice, its teeth like blossoms; that head is more beautiful in shape than the others?\"\n\n\"A son of Maeve; a destroyer of harbours, yellow-haired Maine, man of horses; I left his body without a head; all his people fell by my hand.\"\n\n\"O great Conall, who did not fail us, whose head is this you hold in your hand? Since the Hound of Feats is not living, what do you bring in satisfaction for his head?\"\n\n\"The head of the son of Fergus of the Horses, a destroyer in every battle-field, my sister's son of the narrow tower; I have struck his head from his body.\"\n\n\"Whose is that head to the west, with fair hair, the head that is spoiled with grief? I used to know his voice; I was for a while his friend.\"\n\n\"That is he that struck down the Hound, Lugaid, son of Curoi of the Rhymes. His body was laid out straight and fair, I struck his head off afterwards.\"\n\n\"Whose are those two heads farther out, great Conall of good judgment? For the sake of your friendship, do not hide the names of the men put down by your arms.\"\n\n\"The heads of Laigaire and Clar Cuilt, two men that fell by my wounds. It was they wounded faithful Cuchulain; I made my weapons red in their blood.\"\n\n\"Whose are those heads farther to the east, great Conall of bright deeds? The hair of the two is of the one colour; their cheeks are redder than a calf's blood.\"\n\n\"Brave Cullain and hardy Cunlaid, two that were used to overcome in their anger. There to the east, Emer, are their heads; I left their bodies in a red pool.\"\n\n\"Whose are those three heads with evil looks I see before me to the north? Their faces blue, their hair black; even hard Conall's eye turns from them.\"\n\n\"Three of the enemies of the Hound, daughters of Calatin, wise in enchantments; they are the three witches killed by me, their weapons in their hands.\"\n\n\"O great Conall, father of kings, whose is that head that would overcome in the battle? His bushy hair is gold-yellow; his headdress is smooth and white like silver.\"\n\n\"It is the head of the son of Red-Haired Ross, son of Necht Min, that died by my strength. This, Emer, is his head; the high king of Leinster of Speckled Swords.\"\n\n\"O great Conall, change the story. How many of the men that harmed him fell by your hand that does not fail, in satisfaction for the head of Cuchulain?\"\n\n\"It is what I say, ten and seven scores of hundreds is the number that fell, back to back, by the anger of my hard sword and of my people.\"\n\n\"O Conall, what way are they, the women of Ireland, after the Hound? Are they mourning the son of Sualtim? are they showing respect through their grief?\"\n\n\"O Emer, what shall I do without my Cuchulain, my fine nurseling, going in and out from me, to-night?\"\n\n\"O Conall, lift me to the grave. Raise my stone over the grave of the Hound; since it is through grief for him I go to death, lay my mouth to the mouth of Cuchulain.\n\n\"I am Emer of the Fair Form; there is no more vengeance for me to find; I have no love for any man. It is sorrowful my stay is after the Hound.\"\n\nAnd after that Emer bade Conall to make a wide, very deep grave for Cuchulain; and she laid herself down beside her gentle comrade, and she put her mouth to his mouth, and she said: \"Love of my life, my friend, my sweetheart, my one choice of the men of the earth, many is the woman, wed or unwed, envied me till to-day: and now I will not stay living after you.\"\n\nAnd her life went out from her, and she herself and Cuchulain were laid in the one grave by Conall. And he raised the one stone over them, and he wrote their names in Ogham, and he himself and all the men of Ulster keened them.\n\nBut the three times fifty queens that loved Cuchulain saw him appear in his Druid chariot, going through Emain Macha; and they could hear him singing the music of the Sidhe.\n\nTHE END", "http://genius.com/Lady-augusta-gregory-cuchulain-of-muirthemne-xx-death-of-cuchulain-annotated"]}
