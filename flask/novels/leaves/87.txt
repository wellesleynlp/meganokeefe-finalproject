Arctic Shark Lyrics

How can I proceed with thee?
This eastern harbor's full of grief
All my heavy dreams are simply a luxury
Horses in the pepper tree and the lighthouse floating in the sea
Newborn forms are weightless like doves
Everything will regenerate as it was
All your heavy hearts are simply illusory
They will find an open shell in which to grow and set you free

Mourning how a frozen thing can thaw and turn to brine
Salty workings in a restless process of the mind
Form becoming weightless like doves
Everything will regenerate as love
Not the kind you think you know and not the kind you learn
The arctic shark is living free in the coldest part of the Eastern Sea

All my heavy hearts are simply illusory
Finding time to trust them turning right side up inside of me
