Washington Square Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I sold my piano
It couldn't come with me
I locked up my bedroom
And I walked out into the air
When nothing I needed
Is left there behind me
I walk out through the shadows
Of Washington Square

[Verse 2]
I wandered the highways from Dublin to Berkeley
And I heard the songbirds of Valley Paurine
I love like a fountain
And it left me with nothing
Just the memories of walking through Washington Square

[Verse 3]
Now I live in the shadows
Where light is electric
And time is a number
That rests on a wall

[Verse 4]
And nobody knows me
My friends and my family
Are as far from this city
As Washington Square

[Verse 5]
So cover this warm night
In a blanket of starlight
Then I'll follow this freeway
Out into the air

[Outro]
In case you should wonder
And wanted to find me
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square
Washington Square
Washington Square
