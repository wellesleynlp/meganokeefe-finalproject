Too Young To Fall In Love Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You say our love is like dynamite
Open your eyes
It's like fire and eyes
While your killing me
Your love is a [?]
Why don't you just set me free
Run for the hills
We're both sinners and saints
Not a woman but a whore, I can taste the hate
Now I'm killing you, watch your turning blue
[?] got a man
Just a punk in a [?]

[Chorus]
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
I'm too young

You say our love is like dynamite
It's no surprise you've got one [?]
While you're killing me
Your love is a [?]
[?] got a man
Just a punk in a [?]

[Chorus]

[Chorus] x2
