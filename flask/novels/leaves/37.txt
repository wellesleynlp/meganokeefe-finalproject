Open Your Mind Lyrics

Open your mind
Open your mind

It's early in the morning
I hear this pumping site
I feel like dancing in the atmosphere
I feel the magic up in the air
Open your mind

Open your mind!!!!!
Open your mind!!!!!
Open your mind!!!!!

It's early in the morning
I hear this pumping site
I feel like dancing in the atmosphere
I feel the magic up in the air
Open your mind

Open your mind!!!!!
Open your mind!!!!!
Open your mind!!!!!
