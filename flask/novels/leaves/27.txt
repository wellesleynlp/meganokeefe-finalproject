Berlin Lovers Lyrics

We can't see what's real
We don't know the time
We only want to feel the light, yeah
We came from far
We follow the sound
We fell into a howl of love
He turn by desire
He turn by this live
He turn by desire still so young, yeah
So young, so young, so young, so young
So young, so young, so young, so young
Almost a man, almost a woman
Berlin itself this boy's back home, yeah..
Almost a man, almost a woman
Berlin itself this boy's back home, yeah
Berlin itself this boy's back home, yeah
