European Legacy Lyrics

She smiles at me
From beyond the eastern sea-shore
Flashing jewelled eyes
She hoists her skirts so high
Nouvelle cuisine or an oyster bar ---
It's really up to her
I'll write every cheque she brings to me
I shoot on sight ---
It's my European legacy

Round the castle walls ---
About the Highlands and the Islands
The faint reminders stand
A visitor who took a hand
A thousand years ago, or so ---
Stranded high and dry by tides ---
Washed up a new identity
The channel's wide ---
But it's their European legacy

I strain my eyes
Against the southern light advancing
On whiter cliffs I'm high
The sea birds roll and tumble as they fly
I hear distant mainland music echo
In my island ears
My feet begin to move instinctively
To the warmer beat of my European legacy

She smiles at me
From beyond the eastern sea-shore
Flashing jewelled eyes
She hoists her skirts so high
Nouvelle cuisine or an oyster bar ---
It's really up to her
I'll write every cheque she brings to me
She shoots on sight ---
It's her European legacy
