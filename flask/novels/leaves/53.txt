Big Road Lyrics

It's a big, big long road
Costs about 14 dollars
That's in tolls
A New Jersey turnpike ???!

Big road
By myself

It was around exit number 4
I got pulled over
One more!
Cop said come into the woods with me, boy!

I gotta watch my step
I gotta ???
One mile you forget! (??)
A Roy Rogers roast beef sandwich!

Thomas Edison!
Grover Cleveland!
John Fenwick!
Joyce Kilmer!
Clara Barton!
Vince Lombardi!
Walt Whitman
