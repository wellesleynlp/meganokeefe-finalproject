I Missed Your Party Lyrics

I'm genuinely sorry that I missed your party
You should try holding all the guilt I still carry
Is it any wonder that I say I'm burned out?
When you say you're bummed out
Cause I missed your party

Bourbon won't kill it, so I'll just have to will it
I won't drink the Kool-Aid, try not to be afraid
You say you can see all the goodness inside me, dear me
Say that you want me, for all that I can be

I listen to Billy Joel
I watch Flashdance again
I'm going to get through Walt Whitman
I'm going to be in bed by ten

The Roller Girls are rolling and the rocking boys are rocking
Am I just holding onto memories golden?
I could go out dancing to feel bodies close to my skin
I'd better stay in to face the trouble we are in

I listen to Billy Joel
I watch Flashdance again
I'm going to get through Walt Whitman
I'm going to be in bed by ten
I'm going to be in bed by ten


I listen to Billy Joel
I watch Flashdance again
I'm going to get through Walt Whitman
I'm going to be in bed by ten
I'm going to be in bed by ten

These days I'm well travelled
You can watch me unravel
I'm genuinely sorry I missed your party
