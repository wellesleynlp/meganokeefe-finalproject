We Need Love Lyrics

In Birmingham, in London - what we need now is love
Not hate and fear, blood and tears - what we need now is love

Walking down my street tonight, west London style...
There's something in the air tonight, I haven't felt for a while
I see the fear, I see the fear in your eyes
When they keep you afraid you believe all their lies

In the county towns, in football grounds - what we need now is love
Not suspicion, division - what we need now is love
In Washington, New York City - what we need now is love
Not hate and fear, blood and tears - what we need now is love

Walking down my street today, west London style...

There's something going on today, Everyone's acting wild
I see the fear, I see the fear in your eyes
When they keep you afraid you believe all their lies

In Liverpool, in Glasgow - what we need now is love
Not suspicion, division - what we need now is love
In Washington, New York City - what we need now is love
Not hate and fear, blood and tears - what we need now is love

When the sun goes down, on the mill towns - what we need now is love
Not suspicion, division - what we need now is love
In Washington, New York City - what we need now is love
San Salvador, me amor - what we need now is love
