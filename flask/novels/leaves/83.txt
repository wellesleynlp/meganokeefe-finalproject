Days To Come Lyrics

Journey set sail was to leave
Cause I'm only birds & bees
Lose and news and all things be
Sunlight garden low red blossoms
Moon tides of the sea

When struggling for a magic grain
We throw our life to the winds like rain
For goodness sake
Spare your failings and take the ability
To strengthen
No spirit can stimulate all minds
Blossoms of days to come

Blossoms of days to come

Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
Spirit finds fresh morning and the dew
Of precious things
Hope is a phoenix building wings to fly
And what we wish shall be
Like a breathe of fresh air
Safe and secret powers
That no love can spare

Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul

Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul

Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul 2x

Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
