Three Candles Lyrics

Three candles light the sea, all is quite
Tired of distractions, eastern skies
Fool me once, oh, fool me twice
Oh, tonight's play of illusion

Something whispered against the wind, words scatter
Sweet confusion, blissful lunacy
Bits of wax, moon drops on the sea
Oh, tonight

Three candles light the sea
Come together, rope, wood and steel
Out of body, outside of time
Driftwood dancers, splinters of the mind

Time began, still never seen all together
At the edge ships become the waves
Candles honor the stars in their flame
Oh, tonight

Three candles light the sea
Come together, rope, wood and steel
Out of body, outside of time
Driftwood dancers

Oh, three candles light the sea
Come together, rope, wood and steel
Out of body, outside of time
Driftwood dancers, splinters of the mind
