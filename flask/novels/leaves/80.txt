Sign Of Eastern War Lyrics

Sons of mythic eastern lands
Under the vengeance incarnated
Into the battle were fighting
Over the blood red landscapes
United by the light that came over the sea
With fire in my eyes
Now the moment commends to take
War prisoners for the holy sacrifice
Opening the sign of the nine lakes of fire
And completing this victory
We proudly walk over the mountains of Hacavitz
Watching silently like eastern warriors
The winds of pure black hate
That fills our hearts
Is the sign of eastern war
War in honour of the blessed Gods
Gods that awaits the vengeance
Which flows like boiling poison
Through the veins of every eastern warrior's heart...
