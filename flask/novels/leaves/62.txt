La city Lyrics

Verse 1:
LA city you can be so beautiful
All your streets are filled with dreams and spectacle
Pretty city I must leave when autumn falls
The weather changes elsewhere, I must feel it all, so I can go

PreChorus 1:
OOoooOOOhh, ooooh, oooooooh

Verse 2:
Found a love in Washington who comforts me
I made time to live his way in country peace
Then LA City called me back to chase my dreams
So I left my lover for the truth that waits for me
My love goes

PreChorus 1:
OOoooOOOhh, ooooh, oooooooh

Chorus 1:
From city to city to city to city to city
It is all the same
We are made for each other
From city to city to city to city to city
From city to city to city to city to city
It is all the same
Verse 4
LA city glows ambition night and day
Theres a thirst for fame that I cannot relate
But people from all cities crave the art we make
So I stay and share my songs about my heart that aches
My heart goes
Oooh Oohh

Outro:
From city to city to city to city to city
It is all the same
We are made for each other
From city to city to city to city to city
From city to city to city to city to city
From city to city to city to city to city
It is all the same
Woah, woah, woah woah
From city to city to city to city to city
From city to city to city to city to city
From city to city to city to city to city
It is all the same
