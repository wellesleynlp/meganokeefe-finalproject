The Ballad of the Sad Young Men Lyrics

Sing a song of sad young man
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again so
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men sitting in the bars
Knowing neon nights missing all the stars
All the sad young men drifting through the town
Drinking up the night trying not to drown

All the sad young men singing in the cold
Trying to forget that they're growing old
All the sad young men choking on their worth
Trying to be brave, running from the truth

Autumm turns the leaves gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
And that's the cruelest part

All the sad young men seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for a little while
Tired little girl does the best she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man

While the grimy moon watches from above
All the sad young men play of making love
Misbegotten moon shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light guide them home tonight
All the sad young men
