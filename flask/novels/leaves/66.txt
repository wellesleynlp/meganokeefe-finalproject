My Town Lyrics

New York City, Hollywood, Philadelphia, New Orleans
Cincinatti, San Francisco, Detroit City, Albequerque
Reno, Tuscon, Dallas, El Paso
Tulsa, Vegas, Denver, Seattle

Tonight we stole the keys to the city
Your town is mine, I'm coming through
We'll light a fire underneath your sky
Tomorrow takes us someplace new

Cleveland, Charlotte, Columbus, Salt Lake City
San Diego, Syracuse, San Jose, Talahassee

Nashville, Houston, Portland, Knoxville
Phoenix, Raleigh, Oakland, Mobile
Providence, Washington, Baltimore, Austin
Lafayette, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Boston
