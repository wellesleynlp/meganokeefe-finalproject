Western Shore Lyrics

In this world
When the times are changing, moving on endlessly
Like a river's rolling journey onto the sea
Won't you help me find a way
Into a better day
Help me find a way into the light
All my life
Stranded on that western shore
Fighting battles in my mind
Answers I can't find
Standing on that western shore
Could it be
I'm not half the man you saw inside of me
Left out empty-handed with a broken dream
Won't you help me find a way
Into a better day
Help me find a way into the light
All my life
Stranded on that western shore
Fighting battles in my mind
Answers I cannot find
Standing on that western shore
Cast my dreams upon the tide
Let the water cool my pride
On that western shore
Tell me all about it
Tell me where you're going
Show me how to love you
Won't you help me find a way
Into a better day
Won't you help me find a way
Into the light
All my life
Stranded on that western shore
Fighting battles in my mind
Answers I can't find
Standing on that western shore
Cast my dreams upon the tide
Let the water cool my pride
Standing on that western shore
Answers I can't find
Stranded on that western shore
Answers I cannot find...
