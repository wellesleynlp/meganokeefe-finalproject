Snake Eyes Lyrics

It thundered like hell in the city
Count one hundred ten Mississippi
Now go inside and find some things you think you'd like to keep
Too quiet here for anyone with any sense to sleep

They're meeting tonight at the docks
For blood and dry pair of socks
I saw George Washington ready afloat
Embracing a man in a big yellow coat
