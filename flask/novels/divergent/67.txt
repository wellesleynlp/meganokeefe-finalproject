Desolation Lyrics

My mind's desolation, extreme detestation
Total abnegation, eternal desecration

My mind is desolate, feel my hate
An invisible parasite, dwelling inside
The reign of fear, cruel and severe
My urge to kill, I can't control

No matter what will happen
I will have no regrets
I have relinquished my soul
And come to learn of evil
