The Cyborg Lyrics

I won't know the score when the sedative stains
Nothing enthralled me before
But glimpses of love or disdain

But I don't wanna live forever
I'm not looking for relief
I don't wanna live forever
Your apprehension is what's bringing you peace

I drug you into this mess
And now I push you away
3 years if varnished distress
Polarize delight or dismay
Habitual contempt, to animalistic lust
I could hardly wash it down by the slow, dauntless dusk
