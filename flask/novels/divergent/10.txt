My Lonely Day Lyrics

My lonely day. Don't spoil my pointless sorrow
My lonely day. Don't spoil my self-pity by visiting me today. Nevermind, I hate myself again
My lonely day. What difference does it make?
(for) My Lonely Day
My lonely day. This is whining in vain
My lonely day. There's 5 000 000 000 people
My lonely day. And here I sit like an idiot
My lonely day. Overpopulation but no friends?!?
