Visiting the Zoo Lyrics

Someone told me that you'd gone astray
What am I supposed to say?
Shouldn't I care?
Said you said I'm strictly second rate
Can I reciprocate?
Isn't it fair?
And I haven't got a dime
And I haven't got the time
All the same I'm glad I came
I'm just visiting the Zoo
Cause it makes me think of you
Here's hoping you can do the same

Teenage fever, now you've got it bad
All the old toys you had
Throw them away
Go to college put on high heeled shoes
Get friends that buy you blues
Stay up all day
And I haven't got a dime
And I haven't got the time
All the same I'm glad I came
I'm just visiting the Zoo
Cause it makes me think of you
Here's hoping you can do the same
