Christina Bleeds Lyrics

On the seventh day
He arrived to stay
A sky so grey, opened up for him
Like a hallow man
He kneels down to pray, without a shame
Calling her name

Christina bleeds
The rope's caress, is oh so tight
The hanged man's love his last despise
Christina bleeds
The rope is tight, so fucking tight
Her fragile touch the last thing he felt
Christina bleeds

As the evening crawls
She feels the loss when the wind weeps through
The promise carved in cross
In the evil dusk
She disappears, for the lust
The lost love that sears
Christina bleeds

Christina bleeds
The rope's caress, is oh so tight
The hanged man's love his last despise
Christina bleeds
The rope is tight, so fucking tight
Her fragile touch the last thing he felt
Christina bleeds
