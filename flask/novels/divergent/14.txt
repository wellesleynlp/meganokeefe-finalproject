Francisco Lyrics

[Intro]
1 2 3 4!

[Verse 1]
It's time to wake up... isn't it?
'Cause yeah I've been away... just visiting
I've had my hopes up baby, when I was under
I got my hopes up lately, when I was under

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah!
There's nothing left but time in the world
A second guess looks fine to me girl
I just wanna know

[Chorus]
Was it a day (was it a day)
Or was it forever?
'Cause I've found the place (I've found the place)
The sun shines forever

[Verse 2]
Sweet dreams until you wake up
Eyes closed with visions you make up
Oh I had my hopes up baby, when I was under
I've had my hope up Daisy, when I was under

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Was it a day or was it forever?
'Cause I've found the place the sun shines forever

[Outro]
(Was it a day, was it a day)
Shines forever
I've found the place (I've found the place)
The sun shines forever
