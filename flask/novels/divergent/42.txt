Eternal Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Phoenix in a frozen flame
Trapped in Arctic, Winter crypt
Scars of past have cast the chains
From Book of Ages we are ripped
Raven glide on Polar, winds
Hailstones sharp shards of glass
Banish thoughts of lesser men
In the end flesh is grass

[Chorus]
Divided we fall
United we rule
Hybrid stand tall
Ignite freak with fool

[Verse 2]
Phoenix soar as sunlight thaws
Glacier and frigid earth
Shake the ice from fiery mane
Torch the skies emblazon birth
Raven dive through lightning strike
Whip cirrus into swell
Pierced by deadly shrike
Spirit flies, no man can fell

[Chorus]
Divided we fall
United we rule
Steadfast we toil
Rebellion our tool

[Bridge]
Dauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless
Dauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Phoenix rise and conquer Time
Temper fate
Reclaim the zeitgeist in its prime
Rejuvenate
Raven dive through lightning strike
Whip cirrus into swell
Pierced by shrike
Spirit flies, no man can fell

[Chorus]
Divided we fall
United we rule
Steadfast we toil
Rebellion our tool

Dauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless
Dauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless
