Don't Wanna Stop Lyrics

Slipping into a dream
I can't believe that you're right here
Melting in the rain
(Sparkling colors all over the sky
When you're holding me)
Feel your sweet intensity
I feel intoxicated

Don't wanna stop until I'm flying
Don't wanna wait until i reach the sky
Don't wanna stop until I'm flying
Cause you know how to work me
I'm ready to go-oh, oh

Come and lay me down
Sweep my feet off the ground
Enfold me in your arms
(Cover my body with kisses of velvet and reach for me)
As you put your lips on mine
I feel intoxicated
