EXTERIOR ESTABLISHMENT SHOT, MONARCH BAY, CALIFORNIA 1977

“Well, when the President does it
“That means it’s not illegal.”

“Nixon Admits to David Frost
“On Watergate: I was Illegal Eagle”

INTERIOR YAHOO GLOBAL NEWS ANCHOR KATIE COURIC’S PRISON CELL, (THE FUTURE)

Every President since has double-crossed
Why we had a hunchback for a boss
Read the red-headlines today
Don’t know what-the-F-word they say -
North Korea-SONY fender-bender
A never-ender
“Bush Sr. Hypno’d John ‘Warlock’ Hinckley
“Sirhan-Sirhan Squeaky-Frommed Huntley-Brinkley”
Now we’re stuck wit’ McCartney crinkley

INT. MIND OF THAT BLACK ACTOR WHATSISNAME, TOM HANKS(?), IN “THE GREEN MILE”

Hope they let Katie outta Colonel Klinkly
Girl tunnel out through a colonoscopic wormhole
Like Stephen King caught in a Mexicali sauce mole
Now that we a FEMA-Masonic State, we all in Stalag Oswald

CAMERA GLIDES THROUGH CELL BARS, ENTERS MIND OF KATIE COURIC THROUGH HER EAR

Irgun Masons JDL Mossad
Not on No-Fly torture-terror list
Just Arab Muslims Nuns an’ they “marionettes,”
Xmas firestorms out of Santa’s Ana
Mud-slide quake robo-reported
Beverly Pills got it distorted
“Brad buys Malta for his Alter’
“Takes a pop at Ratso”
Equal to NK leak
“Oprah’s a fatso!”

“Where Is Crash McKlintock?”

Op Ed piece The New York Titty
Two-page spread bangin’ Mayor Shitty
K J-un gon’ nun-chuk yo
“Academy Snubs Leo Da Cap, Bro”
Too bad it’s not a .38 snub blow
River Phoenix, Heath Ledger go
Jack N shrugs, “I warned ‘im!”
Shoulda armed ‘im

Sign up da ‘Wood
Sign up da ‘Wood
Natalie did not survive that flood

Woody Allen say, “Soon-Yi
Surrender,” mutha-f-in’ offender-up-ends her
Gets a three-picture-deal at SKG
“Studio Supports ‘Governor Gropenfuehrer ’”
Stealberg-Katzenberg-Geffen-Schwarzenegger
Man they SK G’S
Schicklgruber’s our nine-inch ruler
The “Carpet Eater” crunches Sony numbers
No it’s Cos’ in trouble
One-to-Three at Tahatchapee
OJ murders Jew and a woman
“The glove didn’t fit”
Then admits it - go fig’
Landis manslaughters Viet children
Gets off with a wrist-slap acquit, craven
Jean Harris murders, out in five-to-seven
N.O.W. busts her out by illegal pardon
Stealberg’s good with “ET” obese chilled-dren
“Sperm-breath” five-year-old Drew in Steal’s kitchen
Geffen left SKG that must SK fo’ po’ Satan
“Do you renounce the works of Steven?”
“I do.”

David Gettin’ on in age, Davidian’s Branch
Takes grads from Eton in full plumage
Boy half-century younger began a gawker
Now he’s the G’s gentleman stalker
That fellow drinks Tchai-kovsky
Nutcracker Sweet. Poor abused Tar-kovsky
In “Intercruller” (“TARR” it’s racist undercover)
Must cost a pretty penny when he
Squiggies Lenny his effendi
Pee-pole movin’ in
Pee-pole movin’ out
Why be-Cos’ of the color of they kin
Or they re-lig-in
We all Willy Loman on da totem
We all Lindsay Lohan on da scrotum
Paris Hilton Freidman Milton Greenspan Stilton
It all “Double Trouble” mockumentary
You want it, cost ya double-century
C’mon, models, REBEL!

Sign up da ‘Wood
Sign up da ‘Wood
They cowards and they cowens

PBS, Brollywood
Cable does Peckerwood
Like Agent Sully would
They cowards and they cowens

Sean’s Clooney Penn bit off some anga
Wished Kim ‘borted by Margaret Sanger
“Notably absent” from the wingding wedding
Leo da Cap Bro an’ Brangelina
Cuz’ that poppa Ratso got dinged
An’ not at 7-‘Leven Judge Reinhold Altadena
Or Simp’s Heimer wit’ Tony Carpet Cleaner
But by Mr. an’ Mrs. Myth

Speak of da Devil’s
Demon House Speaker
I gotta Boehner
For Kim Kardashian
Girl’s got a Glorious Leader
Double platinum
Gonna double flatten ‘em
I’m Guardian of da Piece
One man K-J-un “fish”-fry tease
Kim Kim-Jongs-‘em till she’s Kim-hip-grippin’
That girl need a dog-tail snippin’

Jong’s Fear of Flyin’  still a peter seller
Bit role at the bottom of the Indian Ocean cellar
Flight recorder Dr. Strangelove’s dynamite performance
Why’s it a black box why not white or at least Geronimo
Flight MH-370 shot down by Guantanamo
“It was Wi-Fi-jacked and comin’ in too low”
Or was it off Garcia, Diego
It’s Sunny as von Bulow
Guy see ya, Die, ego
Ukrainians shoot down MH-Flight17
New York Times blamed it on Crimeans
“Bullshit piles up so fast
“You needed wings to stay above it”
Like that fly caught by Lyle Lovett
In “The Player,” Hollywood, love it or shove it

Islam AK-47’s assault and peppered
Satirical poobahs at Charlie Hebdo
“I’ll have da Sauce Houlebecq à bouc to go,”
I got a rocket-propelled fanfarronade
For all the moron moutardes
At the Harvard Malpoon
Chief Thief Alfred E. Rayman
Serves two “Peters” Brueghel’d style Cayman
“Big Fish Eat Little Fish” cooked up in deep dish
(Last five words spelt in near-reverse)
Served with white whine Phlegm-mish
“Pissing at the Moon” he feelin’ mighty peckish
Fo’ Brussel sprouts An’twerps
Alla dem bruthas Breughel Brueghel
Painted “Shipwreck Next To Castle”
I’m da “blood-red paint house painter” Dhimmi  Kimmel
St. Thomas Sawyer follows Huck Finn’s candle
To da Castle to slay stuck pig Eric Grendel
“Wipe yo’ feet don’ you track white blood into my Hell!”
Shouts his mutha like some G-effin’ mohel
House paintin’ inna curious color Elmer Green
“Fishermen and their Catch by a Ruined Tower”
“Triumph of Death” “The Fall of the Rebel Angels”
“Ibis on a Swoop to F-k da Ship’s Poop”
Like Mung Birds from lands of Gordongecko
Je suis (a Viet) ‘‘Charlie,’’ Hebdo
Michael Hastings Magazine, ed., fashionista Kardasho
Served up on PETA bread at da Abacadab Bro over on Melrose
SNL’s Jim Bowney good at da low blow
T-shirt say “Je swish Abdo.”

The Satanic Purses delivered in a thousand hearses
Billion-print-run at a million biles-per-hour
(There will be a Submission fee for the Khartoum Contest)
Tribeca Trifecta star Phecda Monsieur Houlebecq
“Lemony-Ticket” a Fee-Masonic Scott Rudin Production
“Kosher Prices to Rise fo’ Extreme Bio-Unction”
“Politicians Rushed to Photo Op Junction”
Sarkozy shakes Hollande’s presidential hand
H. grinning ear-to-ear
Like da premier of “Palais Royale”
Film Diana starred in as Olive Oyl
Who told da gunmen when Hebdo editors meeting
Seems Masonic seems “le marketing,”
In Hebrew Freemasonic Atbash code
January 7 (1/7 or in Europe 7/1) is an ode
To 71-O-A and in Reverse Atbash Z-Th
Combining into AZOTh, Universal Solvent
In alchemy the Goat’s eye or blood
Charb an’ Cabu goat satirists sacrificed
An’ 1/7 refers to 3 : 17 Book of Genesis
Circumcision, metzitzeh b’peh

Sucking blood from infant’s wound
“Laugh-In” Maltese Bippy goons
Spilling blood-for-ink, cartoonists swooned
In Freemasonic Code of Number Conversion
7/1 = 71 = 63, in numerology 666 the Beast
“The Profit Has Been Avenged”
The star-planet moving to the East
“ISIS Still Expanding in Spite of US Victories”
Freedom of Speech
Means Freedom to Peach
Fo’ Minister of Info’
Faux Minister of Infaux
Not Mohammed, naw
E. Rayman playin’ Allah
At MohamMAD Magazine
Ed., Dieudonné M’bala M’bala
Jean-Marie Le Pen his child’s godfather
Reglement de Comte de Bouderbala

Look it up chump
Second verse same as perverse:
Ghislaine (allegedly) sold clits to nitwits
Like Kardash a-ledge-lee
They dash car crash car at Leona Helmsley
Whut next Reza Mohammad Shah Pahlavi
In bed wit’ eleven underage Antares
Stars shine late in Buenos Aires
O’ wuz Dershowitz seen wearin’ lit tits?
Twirlin’ mortarboard tassels
Whatta buncha –
I mean, P. J. O’Porkrinds
Having a twin Guinness on Isaac Butts Bar
There he sees on the Isaac Butt Swivel-Bridge
Dershowitz teeterin’ on allege
“Jump!” shout da Feds
“Allegedly” from da ledge he leaps
Dersh’ topping his pizza wit’ a Dershosplash
Maxwell to world, “That’s show biz, Kash!”
Bob Maxwell taken out wit’ a shotta joy-juice
“’Board his yacht on international Andrew
Passed da Twelve Smile Limit lost at sea wit’ crew
Jacked Mossad fo’ PROMIS software backdoor trapdoor
Couldn’t run on werdnA, they got ‘im wit’ a hypo
Man that shit’s from V. S. Naipaul!

Name droppin’ hostage swappin’
Rap somethin’ catchy
Notorious Big Amitahb Bachchan
Itchied a Scratchy
Pope Leo Die Cap an’ his Brother Bishop Pecci
Both buggers trigger temblors finger-lickin’-techy
Like Ruskin Rose LaTouche’d by Lyndon LaRuche
Twin grotesquery I say it then it’s in yo’ bouche –
Whassup wit’ dat Kurt in da Hat?
I’m writin’ a memoir, Separated at Kurt
Me ‘n’ Kurt Andersen somehow born Brians-Siamesed
By Kurtian means into early retirement I’m eased
I got da feelin’ I been sleazed
Meanwhile He-Kate be Queenin’
Triplets never gon’ be gleanin’
“Kurt Noses his Preen Gland “anting”
His book cover photo a Dorian Grey
On You Tube boy looks like “Beverly Hillbillies” Miss Jane
Without da “J”
Kurt’s tail curtailed like Kash’s âne

In a Zero Sum society politicians
Study “L’affaire de Metro Charonne,”
“Battle of Algiers’’ “Punishment Park” “Potemkin’’
“Zabriskie Point” “The Passenger” “Vanished”
Ancient Incans sacrificed humans
To their god Condor, Operation Condor
60,000 “disappeared,” Bottled City of Kandahar
Not just the Shining Path guerillas
Students, leftist leaders, union organizers
Pas de problem, c’est en-dehors
Freemasons killed Chris Marlowe
An’ stole his style an’ career
Shakespeare as da front man
Lord Henry Neville as da haunt man
“Da Kate whut ate da Canary
Islands, but JSTOR still trumps Cass
“Canary Eats Kurt”
He’s a literary lyin’
Huck that

“Hara-Kiri  Shut Down by da French State
“Over a “De Gaulle is Dead” Caricature
“44 Bow Street years later
“Charlie Hebdo slammed by Islamic dictature
“Fo’ Mohammed Hara-Kiri-cature”
“Charlie Hebdomadaire
“Charlie He do my dare
“Bonny Prince Charlie at his
Ebb do ma derrière

We livin’ through Hypocralypse
Arabs justifiably pissed
“U.S. Deliberately Missed”
Children hit weddings blammed
Bulgarian Chinese Embassy slammed
Cartoons vicious attacks, man
No Hate Speech muzzle
Fo’ all white males at Hebdo hustle
It’s a Kalashnikovian Kardashnakovian jam
Praise da’ Marmite jar
An’ pass da admonition
“Arabs Kebobed
“In a Paris Banlieue”
Counter-Strike by Friends of Fascist Front Nationale
Against “les meluns” but not too rational
“It’s been a blasphemy”
Becomes “it’s been a blast fo’ me,”
Freedom of Spit, I am not Charlie

Why wasn’t da whole damn French state arrested
As terrorists when Mitterand’s boys bombed
Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior
Wit’ a tricky quickly tickin’ apparatus?
One man killed name of Pereira
So France could test da Bomb in open-air Pacific
Yet Mitterand died after a famous “Last Supper”
Served in bed by Dr. Jean-Pierre Tarot
An endangered Ortolan singin’ ruptured
Cooked Mouffetard-style rue Pot de fer
Like a South Sea lost pilot Google search
The Little Prince committed suicide
While Mitterand gets scuppered, his hide
Not a Brit Periah
Not F.M. apron fo’ Alain Bauer
33 Degree man of da hour
Not a Socialist Messiah
Not a terrorist “Me Sigher”
Who killed Native Son Richard Wright?
Got a shot of rauwolfia serpentina
Left like da Israelites and Brown, Tina
Forced outta da ‘Wood by Ronnie Chasen’s wit in a
Blonde v. Blonde cat fight Purina
Later Ronnie shot by MI-6 hyenas
Gov’s run by Alessandra Czarina
Not Il Duce but Mussolini’s daughter
1.2 million on NSA surveillance list
What are we, Miss USA?
Or terrorists’ chemical constituents valence list?
Welcome to da Non-existent States of America
NSA lotta bullshit, but No Flies List

Methinks Le Pen is mightier than her drawers
Backwards inside-out “drawers” nearly spells “re: sword”
“They went on to their just rewards”
Pulled Le Pen out of le rocher
“New Rochelle Arthur Fisher King seeks Holy Grail”
Arab Islam Freemasonic Fail
Red Crusader cross on sniper Kyle’s tail
GALAHAD backwards spells DAHAL A G
In Sanskrit then Hebrew DEEP DISH New-Person/Ox Pride/Lift Up
King Arthur’s Galahad a deep dish idiot
In deep shit pyx then lifted up

Salvador Allende Tony Franciosa’d

“Mick Jagger Caught in Asia Mynah”

Yet Bill Holden got his tubes muddled
Opposed to family in a world of cannibals

“Peggy Guggenheim Invented the Hoof Bagel”
“Jimmy Stewart Wins Croix de Guerre
“For Not Understanding Heidegger”
“Carstairs Calls Americans ‘Morons’
“Takes a Sleeping Potion”

Rests on da Snooze-itchuary page beside Peg Entwhistle

Into inky blackness, pages like an open pestle
Day of the Locust by West, Nathaniel
Whassup wit’ dat talkin’ grackle

Hollywood’s “Golden Age”
A lie in Balzac’s “Golden Eye”
Mitterand’s Last Supper
Steamed an Ortolan
Songbird endangered
Free-ma-song-ic ritual
Worship of Sumerian god Dinigir
All in Ortolan, rather maudlin
Pereira cooked on Rainbow Warrior
“New Zealand’s First Act of Terrorism!”

Dull chess of A-list Alice

Precession of that Equine Ox

Gatekeeper of Oz, Horus of indifferent “coloreds,”

John Kennedy Toole for his parody
Of New Orleans Freemasonry
And poor, funny writer Flann O’Brien

CUT TO: PROSPERO AT PUCK BUILDING, MANHATTAN, (mid-1980’s)

Full-fathom-five my blather lies
Those were pearls that were my jibes
Like a Low Mar Squid left by eventide
Up to his collar at Deptford’s change of sides
Collapsed, that bridge in Chaucer’s Reeve’s Tale
By the slim weight of Heath bereft of ale
Sent down, and we’re still paying
The fat rub-cheeked black dye-crowned publican
Isaac Butt Home Rule Famine turned from Orangeman
Dye made of squid’s ink from Tristram Shandy Ireland
Widow Bull’s pub grub quidditch after a neap moon paen
Poor Marlowe, too, marooned by prayerless Spy
And twelve moons twice over, Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy
Put on, put off, life’s invite at last in infant’s humid grasp -
Our last breath reduced to rude analogy
In a vinegary obit’ estuary

And so I erred again into life
Like an actress born unto the stage
Without a script or reading page
White as a ski slope’s end of an age
The long wordless tumble into red Vanisha grave
My kingdom was quick divided among my fry
James M. at SNL given status as Chief Sea Leech
Mike L., Horseshoe Crab of Grease, Algae, Acid Beach
And what of Maximum Pross, what’s he to toot?
He must give his Mira on the wall the boot
Gamel too must have his way, camel seahorse
With switched sons in a sea ‘roo’s too soon rued pouch
Laugh-drunk and far off course
His shame slid out without a nurse
And gunsel-smooth sadder Kurt
His hustler image thirty years out from his last flirt
With Gemini-born King Mark, divided my royal mind
T’wixt “Brothers” evil whilst I languish here in a land
Quite too medieval

Am I become Ambassador to Paris? speak of the Neville left to wine
And mutton, else, what?, - passing gas without embarrass
What Queen in the House of Etheridge would fain leave her genius
With an hidalgo come to, at mejor, nada, nothingo
Sarco-vagus, he has some nerve, misty e-cigarettes “zee” view
Fascist Le Pens whose cold ink pool marines the dew
And their Elvish King a simple Flemish ass?

Puck-Arielle, fetch me Sandy Caliban
Spy’s Gregg “Seth” Killday, the “Celia Brady” peach
And your “herbed” companions from Long Island
Quahog and Patchogue and Ronkonkama
Do not forget Asserie Azoth chefs cordon bleu
Wolfgang, Duxbeak, Kinky Trailer Guitar, and have a care
Ratzass be there with his friend Michael Caine
Alert Nasty, Brutish and also Tall and Short
To our predicament, have Ole and Axel call on Abort Talk
“Stalin in high-heels,” and all those inducted
Into the Odor of Meritorious Tatler
By Merle Auberon’s Blondissimus Doomkriegfrau
The Blonde Iraqi (just a teensy brown)
Editor of VF plays Cher for Maples Marla
Then Cher for Ronnie Chasen both of “Burlesque”
(The blonde “lead”ing the blonde)
She let her membership in humanity lapse

While I, Prospero, left on a traffic island, Berlin Alexanderplatz’d
Her excuse, “After the Gulf War crisis, brunette trumps blonde,”
Has Tina come to this? Burnt P. J. O’Cork for Annie Bleepowitz
Though they’re thick as dweebs
Gemini Femini Frumpy Liebowitz
Or that Diana autodafebiography
(Lie detectors fail to confederate her fantasy)
What a mess Rudolf Hess “The American Friend”
MacArthur planned to invade turf Canadian
So the Brits to sleep they pretended
While England Slept the U.S. crept
Into King Henry the Fowler’s fine bird nets
And we must invite Robert Gottlieb
Who killed John Kennedy
Toole, instead promoted Adope Heller
Toole brinked to suicide, Bob a di-putz fella
Assimilated simulated see ya later Uri Geller
Another two feet on the thinning ledge
“Too much of this so its blurring that”
Power tie blue-striped shirt
“Too much of shit so its blurring shat”
Poor Bob missed the fleur-de-lis on JKT’s post
The number 3, Bob didn’t see it’s the G
The 33 Degree, preferred Heller’s 22 skid-doo
And Ian Jack of Granta’s NZ Freemasonic coup

When one has The Book of Codes, one sees
What’s next, dear Puck, a statue of your putti-shaking-pee
From a ledge, drunk Puck teetering over a howling Houston Street?
Or some unsteady poet cleaning windshields
With a TV critic’s scribblings in the Times
On a TV movie based on a Chester Himes
At the same time pissing poteen from the wolf’s tooth
At Donovan’s farm off the craggy cliff
At Bantry in an August-blustery Samhain
IRA bomb took out Mountbatten for his Elmer Gantry
(Fake name stolen by Essex in lost Wessex)
Jacob Omnium can write the Ossipovna Gannibal
Column in the Times, here’s my alpha guest list:
Bing Crosby’s Sicilian “brudda”
Bada Bing, Richard Gere and Buddha Bing
Martian Asparagus Amis, King Zuckerberg
The anamorphic Bitcoin twins of Uglydirge
Ambassadors, both gents provacateurs
Drug Czars, the abattoir of stars
Pro Albatross wrestlers (keep it to four)
Pseudo-DionOvitz, Baron Mauswich
And his latest lonely heart attack
(No roamin’ Vishniacs!)
Ganesha given swine flu
Elohim ebola
Jesus down with sneezes
Allergic to double crosses
Dial up a photomontage by Paula Jimenez
Van Gogh reading The Haunted Man by Chas. Dickens
Professor Redlaw angry about poor Dick’s end
James Gandolfini with an escort of Egypt’s top baboons
(Freemasonic final photo courtesy of a “Phil-adelphia ‘Koople’”)
Télésurveillance police municipale, violence banalisée
Tranquillité vacances garanties (dans banlieues gratuites
Surtout à St.-Mandé), General Munro (Fifth Column) tweets
“Korben Dallas cannot meet defeat.”
Seat The Wizard of Gettysburg beside Diane von Furstenberg
Have her whip-wounds treated by the Asian Dr. Who
With a Tincture of Dishonesty, she the first in iceberg preserved
Till it splits in two to spill her out as fashion’s goo
Post-thrown-garter tarentellas, throw her to the fellas
In the mosh pit writhing with totalitarian twits
While Farnham Charlestons, X-arm-kneed, on the mantelpiece
(Boston’s famed balloonist McSorley’s somehow missed)
And tell Last, “Butt not Least,”
Still, sit Last beside the Beast
Western Freedom’s just a stone’s throw away
In the Battle of Plataea a Spartan threw a stone
Hit the Persian general square on his dome
Mardonius killed, Greek general Pausanias rushed in
It all ended Persian-badly at the river of Asopus
And today, radical Greeks hope to ass-soap us

That being sad, we’ll have the ball end badly
Invite the 29 duels of Alexander Pushkin
All fought over slight Olga Larina
The last ball has Pushkin “ballerina”
Beneath a cherry tree, shot as one of Russia’s “superfluous men”
Oblomov’d by “herstory” on a couch by Rudderless Tipling
Or some such author perilously Chekhovian, -
Yes, uninvite Kurt Kreamer-Andersen

Speaking of ladies and their lapdogs
Why not dig up Edie Sedgewick
“End Badly” Andy, who love-killed her
Let her die, stole her style
Later got shot by the gal he defiled
(After Sister or Sor Juana, Solanas and “Waltzing Mathilda,”
Valerie’s Carboard Andy “waltzing” after a “Mighty Battle”)
Andy’s Capri pants Aldo Mori’d in a cookie jar
Robin Williams’ watches cower in an argyle sock
Because Coluche, his avatar, by a truck got smacked
La Moto Braque’d under a Michelin track
Viva, Bike Boy left a Basquiat case
At last Valerie Jean Solanas’ SCUM Manifesto
Promotes the eradication of all men from “Her” planeto
No more Manhattan “co-managers of the shit-pile!”
No now it will be Womyn-hat-on, celeb runway style
No more men’s vulgar ejaculations, “neat-o!” or “Sieg heil!”
Our Jean Val-Jean Stars in “I Shot Andy Warhol,” with Ultra-Violet
Cicciolina avec des pneus, Alessandra Mussolini, Tippi Hedren’s lion
2Pac a Pepper’s Ghost at Coachella goat-shaped Plantation golfing
With Bafomet Google Map and Joe Dallesandro rapper dauphin -
Buried cold in Warhol’s vault behind his Factory face

CUT TO: PROSPERO’S DAYDREAM INTER-LEWD

Walking home the Senator spies Maura
Dancing in the Tivoli fountain
With her clothes on, but with Abadon
What does it mean this shrewd “abandon”?
“The Republican Senator from Israel a Paragon”
That Act should be repealed
I don’t recall voting for that schlemiel
The Senate needs a final face peel
Getting old, this act, this “nation.”
Civilization and this hypocrisy it’s based on
Civilization debases, one man left on
Side’s retired, so much for the bastion
Inning over outing over bring home the caissons
From Baghdad from Helmland and from Khe Sanh

CLOSE: PROSPERO’S FACE AS HE SNAPS OUT OF HIS DAYDREAM

Oh! and do inviteVanity Fair ‘s King Gray Dung Carter
Shoveling dungster-loving Epstein, he’s quite a Bart-erer
Jeff frees up steins as skulls do minds
Yes, – all heads lose their minds, at the last --

Yes, yes, Puck-Arielle, let these pages be the modest stage I’ve set
A snapping, dancing firestorm balletic in its burnt ham wit
Served to inane dunces slit by the Sphinx’s dagger solar ambit
They say in Tanzania chimpanzees have firedancers
Better than our straitjacket flits. Poor Lord Peter Apnea
Thought himself a spider, left without a web -
Let fly, - and in his fall a nation’s necromantic fancy
Blossoming black wisp readings of Wills left intestate
With us to suck the squirt of Hecate’s next pressed breast leak
Harried by autumnal colors, lightning lapels bespoke fraternity
Yet touched us to the quick at Chappaquiddick
That season I lost someone to a double game of quidditch
While Henley ‘scaped us through starry windows with fair Eternity
Abiding now in the gossamer of Winehouse Algol Mugwump
Shall we as a nation hew it, this Jamestown starve’s dream of London
With binge-purge Diane and too-poignant Ferguson
In Sloane Square encompassed by a Bafomet’s cussing
As misery would have it in a bear’s paw fern or pelican’s ladle
The fish that flipped out like a tired dredl
Or Jeffrey who clawed his way to the top
To steal it from toddlers wearing bonnets
With no St. Lou’ as ludique guide, no arch Spencer-ian sonnet
No Wainwright Building’s bullet window to kill an Eric
Errant like that vile girl of Metz “burnt at the stake,”
Unhorsed by violent bowman, rein, spit and bloody bit

Yes, cowslip-anthem, mercurial blood-bubble Puck
Twin of Arielle of Dumbassle, make thee hence and fly the coop
Let stars rue your rooster flight to subtle cups
Drunk as a deep dish from a shallow river’s death
And brought thereby to edgy heath, Elizabeth’d
By tickling Seymour and stand-offish Parr
Alice through Elizabeth’s The Mirror
Or the Sinful Soul, (“KP” on embroidered cover
With KAPHR for nations conquered perhaps meaning “KAFFIR”)
Her gown nevertheless cut to tatters left in clover
Like luckless Seymour when his head did shatter
Bloody scalp and ensign pulver’d

Thusly Puck and quickly, act the peduncle to the stigma born
Steady your eager stamen in conundral ether for the Virgin Queen
Crowned by her one Corona in a painting by Nicolas Poussin
Ants shall mark thy anther-dusted path far as Karlsruhe’s
Nighttime inflorescence, there to find Lord Strange
With Cistercian plotters minting finskies, Daphneange
Miranda and Sabrina Guinness, Sylvie Boucsasse
And J. “Bottom” Wildenstein, ivresse at last embraced
“Midsummer Night’s Merde” or Dream defaced
Well! a toast of dew, off you fly with curt adieu, -
And have a care you post bail for Clare’s Irby’s
Bangalore arrest!

But as you fly this atmosphere goodbye
Like poor Branson after his meteoric hayrick fire
Bring back the Demon not some Sasquatch
Fear Caliban, and keep a watch
Recall that Ariel-Caliban anagrams
Aréole BAL I CAN
Or Ari El Bal Icon
Or BAL(L) (EYE) I CAN
PRO-SPEAR-O (“eye” in Hebrew)
Or the Free Masons’ sign
Medieval mother AERIAL PEL-I-CAN
That plucks its AUREOLES  to feed its clan
Or something worse, perhaps a soul
Some dark whisper from the diary of Elias Ashmole
BAL IN A Aréole, yes, ball in an aureole!
Elizabeth’s head pox-scarred, bewigged, half-bald
Soprano to Doubting Tom, “in our coy tuss’, interruptus.”

Be Ronnie chastened by this verse, Puck-Arielle
At Karlsruhe Institute there you’ll meet BHL
The greatest mind of the International Date Line
Ovule go then on this Venetian-Marlovian mission
Don’t spend too much time with my double
Poor Marlowe in the city that is sinking
Pollen is the reason we’re all made gay superstitions
So dally not with masquerados
You must return by way of Carl’s rue
Cormaic’s Wain as it was called by Gaels and Britons
Grab this wheeling Big Dipper by its “Hold de Grail” queue
Below your merry round you’ll hear bad German
“Kartoffeln statt Döner” (“Potatoes Not Kebob!”)
Yet potatoes were brought to Karlsruhe by Spanish ensigns
(You’ll find in that land fantasticated aphorisms)
Alas, there is no time to entertain such aphid notions

Here’s a pence, then, stop off for something stöllen
And as we live between lives in no time thrice
From tottering sots to tots on trikes
Here’s the two-fold universe’s one-time back-rent –


CLOSE ON PROSPERO POURING GOLDEN SAND THROUGH PUCK’S OPEN FINGERS BY STRANGE MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO THE SORCEROR AND HIS APPRENTICE

On dis stub of paper stained in a tub
FBI TIPS LINE: 1-800-555-2015
An’ dat ain’ da half, Puck-Arielle
Pete Townsend an’ Peg Entwhistle
Said it best in their Make-out Manson co-writ spittle
“Surfin’ Clover Bugsy Thistle 29 O’clockish Missile”
Junipered by Donovan and Brian Wilson
“The Kids in the Hall Are Alright
“But we can’t pay them crikey’s blight.”
Such a tune it was, such an air
Yet why Carter Burwell’s Carla Bruni laugh
When I told ‘im John Lennon got sacrificial calfed?
Payback fo’ “Don’t trust anyone under 30,”
Jack N’s porcine white nostrils filthy-dirty
Or aristocratic gaffe?

Puck, I am a’feared
Last night I saw a mean white cat
Creeping in poplar moonlight
Four X’s ‘cross its back
What is da meanin’ of dat?

Cat-meaning finds its own resolve
We must seek the Universal Salve
Babylon’s Enkidu lies gored by the Bull of Heaven
We hunt a rare rough poultice to thickly armor
Prospero in the gown of Gilgamesh

And, but still, Puck, maybe we should pistol
Way past Bristol
To da Tao of da 19heaventies
For these times suck
We could get laid by da Marchesa Casati
Or Isabella Blow, meet up wit’ Rakehell
Or Weedkiller, da reverend’s Dom Perignon
Make out wit’ da wardens of Lower Orkney
Bed down wit’ naked moles munchin’ chaplains’ organs
Federico Garcia Lorca them in an Andalusian ditch
While Baron Munchausen shoots a buck wit’ cherry pips
Or Puck, how bout’ dis –
Afghan women in da Second Anglo-Afghan War
Into captured soldiers mouths they drowned em wit’ their piss
We could do some dat water-boardin’ wit’ da trolls of CIA-ISIS
If they insist

Dear, drear Caliban, while I sympathize
With your plight, a virgin at age 1,098
Unlike the first woman President of the H. Lampoon
Who won, they say, by a manslide
We must not despair, off to the 19heaventies
We must fly, to the Heavenly Music Corporation
We must not tarry in your prurient imagination
A division of the East India Porkeration

US-Europe da hippo sent to Crete

CUT TO: ISLAND OF CRETE, AFTERNOON OF THE FAUN, A HIP-HOP LULLABYE, YET SOMEHOW PERTINENT TO PRESIDENTS

The hippo sent to Crete
Denied it was a creature
Because it sported human features

When questioned at Cretan customs
It scraped and lowed and mooed and bowed
To the customary doubts
Employed the usual nostrums
It japed and booed and soiled and howled

But turned back once, turned back twice
The poor hippo was turned back thrice!
Mr. Customs in his uniform so fine
Wondered aloud if hippos could be humankind
“Do you have a sparkle in your eye
“And a waltz inside your feet?”

“I can gargle, and I’m very good at sleep!”

“Can you fiddle
“Nail-bite nibble
“Do you even think?

“I can dribble
“I’m all middle
“And occasionally I blink!”

Turned back each time and much less nice
Nothing worked, not even hippo spice!

“Can you sing
“Do you speak Twaddle
“Can you cook while reading books?”

“I can swim
“I can waddle
“I can fish without a hook!”

“It takes more than that!
“YOU’RE JUST A MONSTER IN A HAT!”

Finally, and with a voice KA-BOOMING
The hippo on two legs stood there LOOMING
“I AM NOT A CREATURE!
“I’VE GOT HUMAN FEATURES!”

The tired Customs man glared
Then stared and stared and stared
He did not care
Like a Duchess made of ice
He wasn’t very nice

Then suddenly Mr. Customs
Stamped the hipposterous passport
Shouting to two tubby assistants
Who’d fallen asleep in their drool
(Two little guppies had snuck in
To swim inside their nostrils
Till the assistants felt a double-trouble tickle
Ending with a sudden sneeze of fishy trickle
The guppies didn’t want to tumble
Into just anybody’s middles!
They safely hopped away into a barracuda’s muzzle

The assistants snapped awake
Blinked and waddled
Through their nasal muddle
To gape at a hippo on two feet with a hat
Standing there quite befuddled
As Mr. Customs shouted with a great big snort
“Let him through the back door quick!
“Like you two Cretans claiming to be human
“HE’S A HIPPO CRETE!”

Whoa-oh Whoa-oh Woah-oh
They comin’ afta lames
