Plan Of Peace Lyrics

Rising resistance decision to abort
Plan of peace in danger
This weight on our shoulders
Much to heavy now to hold
Dreams of high cards
Now have been thrown fold
Near the edge one push and we fall
Dauntless angels seeing no wrong
Scenes from our future
Reflected in the past
Farther in debt to the hour glass
This story we're writing
Much to sad to be told
There is no reason
For this course that we chose
Near the edge one push and we fall
Dauntless angels seeing no wrong
A cold sun is rising
In the mist of poison skies
Our life lines are severed forgotten
The cry of a new child
Will echo in the night
To retrace the ones
That have been left behind
Near the edge one push and we fall
Dauntless angels seeing no wrong
