Being Lyrics

First day in an unknown place
Nothing to say just a seeing face
Checking names and codes
Longing to give an ode to fame
I kept friends in my mind
And a part of the land I left behind
So here I start to break the ice
Beyond the mirror of peoples' eyes
Step out from lethargy
To show the world what I can be

So we ride all doors are open now
To ride, take the straight way to anywhere

Good day in the warmest place
Nothing to say just visiting space
Solar point in stellar plan
Stairpath cuts through cosmic land
Magma of thoughts lava of soul
Can pay with time patience is rewarded

So we ride all doors are open now
To ride, take the straight way to anywhere
