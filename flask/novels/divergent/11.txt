Setting Sun Lyrics

I hate what I've become
I know I'm not the only one
That doesn't make it any easier

How can you stand in my setting sun
Knowing full well what I have done
While you were visiting your kin

It was a good day for love that way
Maybe not such a good day for me
But a good day for you

I am what I have done
I know I'm not the only one
That only makes it a little bit harder

It was a good day for love that way
Maybe not such a good day for me
But a good day for you
