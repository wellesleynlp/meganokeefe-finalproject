Three First Discoverers (Part 1) Lyrics

CUT TO: Shinichi's Mansion

Cut to the kitchen. FBI agents Subaru Okiya, Jodie Starling and Andre Camel discuss the latest updates about the Black Organization.

JODIE STARLING: And? Why did you have us check if anyone was following us and come here? Surely you didn't just want to show us your improved talent for disguises.

SUBARU OKIYA: No. This morning I received a message from Kir. Mizunashi Rena.

ANDRE CAMEL & JODIE: Yes?

ANDRE: Then they don't know you're alive.

SUBARU: Probably not.

Subaru takes his phone out.

SUBARU: But her message contained only three letters.

JODIE: Three letters?

ANDRE: Was it an abbreviation?

SUBARU: No. It's the name of a liquor you're very familiar with. R-U-M. Rum. Subaru holds his phone up for everyone. One of their code names.

Jodie and Andre are startled.

JODIE: Rum?

SUBARU: When I was in the Organization, I heard the name a couple of times. It seems he's their boss's close adviser.

ANDRE: A-A close adviser?

JODIE: But we haven't heard anything about that.

CUT TO: Teitan Elementary School

SUBARU: (On Conan's radio transmitter) Since she sent only one word, it was probably an urgent message. She couldn't afford to tell you. In any case, tell James someone big is on the move. Someone bigger than Gin.

CUT TO: Opening Credits

CONAN EDOGAWA: (Narrating) Three First Discoverers: Part One!

CUT TO: Walkway

MITSUHIKO TSUBURAYA: By the way, did you see yesterday's Tokyo Derby?

GENTA KOJIMA: The Spirits versus Noirs match, right?

AYUMI YOSHIDA: I did! Hide got a hat trick, right?

MITSUHIKO: That's right! It's no wonder he's their star player!

AI HAIBARA: Rum? "Datcha"?

LUM INVADER: Darling...

CONAN: Not the comic character, the liquor. You know, the stuff pirates drink.

AI: I have no idea what you mean. I told you before. I don't know much about the liquor.

CONAN: R-Right... (Thinking) To get information on Rum, close adviser to the Black Organization's boss, we'll need to wait to hear from Mizunashi Rena-san, who's infiltrated the Organization, or ask undercover public safety officer Amuro-san...

AI: But, I know the Organization's number two code name is Rum.

CONAN: (Thinking) Number two?!

AI: At the very least, that's what I heard while I was there. I never met them, though.

CONAN: Wh-What were they like? Are they a man or a woman?

AI: I said I never met them. While I was in the Organization, I heard all kinds of descriptions. A large brawny man. An effeminate man. An old man. Some people claimed they were all his doubles.

CONAN: "A large brawny man, an effeminate man, and an old man"..

AI: Hey! Don't tell me Rum's searching for me.

CONAN: N-No.. The Organization uses types of liquors for all its code names, right? I was just wondering if there was someone named "Rum"..

GENTA: What about Rum?

AI & CONAN: What?

GENTA: You were just talking about it.

MITSUHIKO: That Rum is looking for someone.

AYUMI: Tell me. I'm curious.

CONAN: What? Uh- Rum.. Rum.. Ramune!

GENTA, MITSUHIKO & AYUMI: Ramune?!

CONAN: I bet you're thirsty after playing soccer in the park. So I was looking to see if the shop over there was selling ramune.

MITSUHIKO: Ah, you mean the drink?

GENTA: Normal juice is fine.

CONAN: Y-Yeah..

AYUMI: Huh? That kid is still there.

AI: What kid?

AYUMI: Look. The boy standing in the other street. He was standing there on our way to the park. He was staring into the distance then, too.

MITSUHIKO: What is he looking at?

GENTA: Maybe someone's about to fall from a high place.

CONAN: Let's ask him.

EVERYONE: Yes!

Everyone runs across the alleyway to question the kid.

CONAN: (He's looking at an apartment?) Hey, you. What are you..?

THE KID: (Cries) The lady.. They killed the lady!

EVERYONE: Yes?!

CONAN: Did you see someone kill her?

THE KID: No, but she told me. Three men were going to visit the lady's apartment. If she doesn't come out after they leave, she's probably been killed, so I should call the police.

AI: So the woman..

THE KID: She's not coming out! It's been about thirty minutes since the third man left.

MITSUHIKO: Did you call the police?

THE KID: Not yet. I'm too scared.

CONAN: Do you remember what the three men looked like?

THE KID: Y-Yeah.. There was a really big man, a young guy with a hair like a girl, and an old man with white hair.

CONAN: (Shocked. Thinking) What?

AI: (Narrating) "A large brawny man. An effeminate man. An old man."

CONAN: (Whispering) Hey! Do you think..?!

AI: It's too much of a coincidence. But Rum always had a special trait. The description of his appearance were varied, but the trait was always the same. I can't remember what it was..

CONAN: In any case, show us to the woman's room. It's that apartment, right?

THE KID: Okay.

Conan runs to the apartment. Others follow him. They walk upstairs.

MITSUHIKO: What's your relationship with the woman?

GENTA: Is she a relative?

THE KID: No. I don't know her.

EVERYONE: What?

CONAN: She's a total stranger?

THE KID: Yeah. She'd talk to me when I was playing alone in the park. Since I moved here, I didn't have any friends.

AYUMI: But your parents know about the lady, right?

THE KID: No. I don't have a dad nor mom.

MITSUHIKO: Really?

THE KID: Yeah. While I was on a trip, they got involved in a "robin murder."

CONAN: (Thinking) A robbery and murder.

THE KID: I'm staying with my uncle, but he's too busy to play with me.

AI: So after seeing how lonely you were, the woman decided to play with you.

THE KID: Yeah. I asked to come to her house to play before, but she wouldn't let me. But today she made an exception and invited me. She writes stories for TV shows.

The kid rings the doorbell.

THE KID: She told me all about the story she was going to write.

CONAN: (Thinking) She's a scriptwriter?

The kid rings the doorbell again.

THE KID: Ma'am!

The kid rings the doorbell twice more.

MITSUHIKO: There's no answer.

GENTA: Excuse me.

Genta grabs the door handle.

GENTA: It's unlocked!

THE KID: You can't go in! She told me if she didn't come out, I should let the police handle it and stay outside!

CONAN: (Thinking) Does that mean..? (Conan opens the door. A lady's corpse is hung on the ceiling.) I knew it.

Ayumi screams.

THE KID: Ma'am! Ma'am!

CONAN: Don't come in! Haibara, call the police.

AI: Got it.

MITSUHIKO: Should we call an ambulance, too?

CONAN: No, look around her feet. If this were really a suicide, there would be a stool or something by her feet. Since that's something, it means someone killed her and made this look like a suicide. It was probably one of the three men this kid saw. If it's about thirty minutes since the third man left, we're too late.

MITSUHIKO: No..

CONAN: (Thinking) That's odd, though. (Conan steps inside the room.) Even though he was panicked enough to forget the stool, there are no signs he left the room in a hurry. And I don't see the Yoshikawa lines left behind when a strangulation victim struggles. I'd understand if he struggled her to putting her into sleep. But who would plan that much and forget the stool? (Conan notices a white envelope.) An envelope? (He picks up the envelope. The envelope sender reads "Tohto Bank.") A bank envelope. It's new, too. Which means in the wallet on the desk.. There should be the money she withdrew. But there's barely anything in here. (Conan picks up the bank ATM paper.) All that's inside is the bank's ATM usage details. According to this, she withdrew 500,000 yen three hours ago. But the money's nowhere to be found. Which means he killed her for the money.

AI: In any case, it's clear this sloppy crime wasn't their work.

CONAN: Yeah.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: I see.. So you were watching this apartment at the woman's request, and after three men came and left, you came here to find her like this?

THE KID: Y-Yeah.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: The deceased is scriptwriter Komai Yasue-san.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes, sir.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: If this is murder, we'll have to find people among her associates, who may have resented her and call them in for a lineup with this kid.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: We have the names of the three people the victim was meeting here today.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Yes?

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: They're in the scheduling software installed in the computer on the desk. This afternoon she met Sakaba Ronbei, Habanaka Kuramichi, and Shibakaru Denji.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Really?

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes. It's written on the notebook in the drawer and calendar, so it's probably correct. Also, we can't find the 500,00 yen the victim withdrew from the bank today anywhere.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: So they killed her for the money, make it look like a suicide, and ran. Find out who they are and call the station.

The kid looks downstairs, scared.

AYUMI: What's wrong?

THE KID: Th-They're here.. The three men who came to the woman's room are here!

GENTA: S-Seriously?

CONAN: Can you point them out while keeping your face hidden behind the railing?

THE KID: O-Okay.. Let's see..

CONAN: Did you find them?

THE KID: Yeah.. The stocky man over there, that long-haired man to the side, and the old man behind him.

CONAN: Inspector Megure! (He whispered into his ears.)

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Got it. Takagi-kun.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes, sir!

RONPEI SAKABA: Give me a break, officer. I just came to check out the incident in the neighborhood. Why am I being questioned?

DENJI SHIBAKARU: We're just passers-by.

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Or do we look like wanted men?

INSPECTOR MEGURE: No, a witness saw you visiting the victim's apartment between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, the presumed time of her death. The witness also said the victim Komai Yasue-san asked him to watch the apartment because one of the three men coming to visit may kill her.

RONPEI SAKABA: Kill her? Isn't this a suicide?

INSPECTOR MEGURE: A suicide?

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Normally a hanging is a suicide..

INSPECTOR MEGURE: How do you know the victim hung herself?

RONPEI SAKABA: Uh, well..

DENJI SHIBAKARU: It seems I can't hide it. I am Shibakaru Denji.  We became drinking buddies after a chance meeting at a bar. This photo proves it. She said she was worried so I came to talk, but I had no idea it had driven her to suicide..

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: So she was already dead when you arrived?

DENJI SHIBAKARU: Yes, so I have no idea what she was concerned about. If you want to know, try asking these two. Not that I know who these are.

RONPEI SAKABA: Hey!.. I came to get the money she borrowed. We're old friends, so I lent her a bunch of money. But now I need that money, so I asked for it back.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Was the amount 500,000 yen?

RONPEI SAKABA: What? H-How did you know that?

INSPECTOR MEGURE: (Thinking) So this is the man who took the money.

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Excuse me.. I'm actually a producer at TV Tohto. I hired Komai-san to write a script for this fall's special mystery program. She said the script was ready, so I came to pick it up.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Where was the script?

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: It was just at the door, so I took it and gave it to my AD.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Was she already hanging then?

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Yes.. I don't know what was worrying her, but the script was due, so I didn't have time to think about it.

CONAN: Yeah, but.. wouldn't you normally call the police if you saw that? Why didn't you?

AI: He's right. No matter what you had to do..

GENTA: You'd call the cops..

MITSUHIKO: Especially if you knew the victim..

AYUMI: Why didn't you?

CONAN: Surely you didn't have a reason you couldn't call the police.

DENJI SHIBAKARU: N-No..

RONPEI SAKABA: Mind your own business, kid!

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Who is that boy in the glasses?

DENJI SHIBAKARU: Mind your own business.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: They were the first ones to discover the body. Though it seems like you're the actual first discoverers. In any case, we'd like you separately, so come inside one at a time.

RONPEI SAKABA: Oh. I've got an alibi!

INSPECTOR MEGURE: An alibi?

RONPEI SAKABA: The money was supposed to be deposited by 2:00 PM, but when I checked the ATM, there was no money. So I came here to get it myself.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: I see.

RONPEI SAKABA: I got scared when I saw her dead body, so I rushed back to the ATM. I had to pay off my card today, so I was forced to use the money I had.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: How is that an alibi?

RONPEI SAKABA: ATMs have security cameras. If you compare the time between when I left and came back, with how long it takes to get from here to the bank and back, you'll know I didn't have time to kill her.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: That's not quite an alibi, but it will help the investigation.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Is the bank nearby?

RONPEI SAKABA: Yeah, it's pretty close.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: I'll go with him to the bank to check.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Thanks.

DENJI SHIBAKARU: Is is all right if I smoke while we wait? I've got a portable ashtray.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: Go ahead, but the wind's picked up. Don't scatter the ashes.

DENJI SHIBAKARU: All right.

CONAN: (Thinking) That's a huge flame.

Kuramichi Habanaka coughs by the smoke.

DENJI SHIBAKARU: Sorry, did I get you with the smoke?

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: No, it's all right.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: (Whispering) You really don't know the order in which they came from?

THE KID: No. I know it's them, though.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: We'll need to question them more.
I see. He was really on the ATM's security camera footage?

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes.

RONPEI SAKABA: We can smoke? I'll have one, too.

Detective Takagi walks up to Inspector Megure.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: (Whispering) But, sir, he was away from the ATM for forty minutes. It's hardly an alibi. It takes less than twenty minutes to get there and back.

INSPECTOR MEGURE: (Whispering) Then why didn't he mention it?
DETECTIVE TAKAGI: (Whispering) He nearly escaped a few times. I think he may have been after that.

RONPEI SAKABA: Damn it.

KURAMICHI HABANAKA: Would you like to use mine?

RONPEI SAKABA: Thanks. Sheesh. You don't need to glare. I won't try to escape any more. It was just a joke. Oh- uh.. Sh-Shall we get these interviews over with?

INSPECTOR MEGURE: All right. You're first.

RONPEI SAKABA: Who, me?! Fine. Go easy on me.

CONAN: (Thinking) I see.

AI: Figure anything out?

CONAN: Yeah. The person who caused this incident and the name of that kid.

CONAN: Hey, Detective Takagi. I think you should search the room harder.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: What?

CONAN: There's definitely 500,000 yen in there somewhere.

DETECTIVE TAKAGI: What?

CONAN: Also.. Can I borrow 20,000 yen?
