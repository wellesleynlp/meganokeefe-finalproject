Unsung Heroes Lyrics

Forgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away

Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time

A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear

Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time

Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow

A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war
