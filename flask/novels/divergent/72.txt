Drownin Lyrics

Anybody can pack it up
Everybody is irrational
Anybody don't want to love someone with
Abnegation
It's so easy to crack shit up
Life cna be so dangerous
How could hell be worse than all of this
Desperation

Chorus:
Life can be so dangerous
Everybody takes a tumble
Life can be so dangerous
Everybody takes a tumble
Everybody is dangerous
I am drownin'
Everybody is dangerous
I am drownin'
Anybody can understand
Everybody is sensational
Anybody don't want to get things done with frustration
So easy to wreck shit up
Somebody feels glorious
My blood turns cold and now fels like no emotions

Chorus:
Life can be so dangerous
Everybody takes a tumble
Life can be so dangerous
Everybody takes a tumble
Everybody is dangerous
I am drownin'
Everybody is dangerous
I am drownin'
Anybody can pack it up
Everybody is irrational
Anybody don't want to love someone with
Abnegation
So easy to crack shit up
Life can be so dangerous
How could hell be worse than all of this
Desperation

[Chorus:]
