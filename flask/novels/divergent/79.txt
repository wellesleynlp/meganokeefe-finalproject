I sit Down When I Pee Lyrics

[Tim]
I sit down when I pee
There's nothing that crazy 'bout me
I'm just taking a whiz
Mind your own biz
Why is everybody always staring at me?

[Eric]
Hey bro, I gotta go
Let me through, I gotta go number 2

[Tim]
No can do I'm takin a pee
Sitting on the lou having a good long wee

[Eric)
Are you sitting down?

[Tim]
I'm sitting down

[Eric]
And you're not making brown?

[Tim]
No, I'm not making brown!

[Eric]
Are you making iced tea?

[Tim]
No, just lemonade

[Eric]
But are you sitting down?

[Tim]
I'm sitting down!!!

[Eric]
Why don't you stand like a regular man
Then you can pee in the urinal can

[Tim]
You really wanna know why I'm sitting strong?
I just can't stand touching my dong
