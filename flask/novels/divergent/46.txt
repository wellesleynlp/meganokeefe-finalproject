I'm Calling Lyrics

When I was a little
Girl I called for you
Come and save me from this, wicked world I'm born into!

Let's play a game of hide and seek
I want my prince to rescue me
From the evil lurking at my door

My destiny, my fantasy, I'm calling, I'm calling
Was tempted by a mystery, I called to you, Only for you

My dreams are all for me
He'll move the sun and stars, no fallacy
I'm dauntless when I'm with you
Child like dreaming, I call for you!

When I'm all alone
A damsel in distress
He'll come and save me from this, wicked world I'm born into!

He rides the night, defeats the storm
We'll sneak away by early dawn
To his kingdom in the sky!

My destiny, my fantasy, I'm calling, I'm calling
Was tempted by a mystery, I called to you, Only for you

My dreams are all for me
He'll move the sun and stars, no fallacy
Im dauntless when I'm with you
Child like dreaming, I call for you

My dreams are all for me
He'll move the sun and stars, no fallacy
Im dauntless when I'm with you
Child like dreaming, I call for you
