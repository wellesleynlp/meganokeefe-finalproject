Slower Baby Lyrics

Slower baby wind it down
Go slower baby, when you move around
It's the rule of not to lead
It's the friction not the heat

If you hold it right back
You're on the right track
Go slower baby, when you ride inside the sound
Slower baby just let it slide

When you roll a thing, you know it's gonna swing
Put my mind at ease, you know you're such a tease
Slower baby, just let it flow
Go slower baby, you can make it grow

Chill it to the womb let me drive it home
Anticipation relaxation
Slower baby
Go slower baby

Slower baby, wind it down
Go slower baby, when you move around
Slower baby
Go slower baby
Slower baby
Go slower baby
