Ferris Wheel Lyrics

Walking in the seashore twilight
It's then you spy carnival lights
You slowly near the magic sight
Tangerine sky minus one kite

Take time and tie your pretty hair
The gypsy driver doesn't care
If you catch your hair in the ferris wheel on top
In the ferris wheel on top

A silver bicycle you shall ride
To bathe your mind in the quiet tide
Far off as it seems your hair will mend
With a Samson's strength to begin again

Take time and dry your pretty eyes
Watch the seagull fly far-off skies
To build its nest in the ferris wheel on top
In the ferris wheel on top

If ever I reach her

And the moral here, if any, my friend
Follow through your dream to the end
Dig the seagull fly across the sky
To build its nest in the ferris wheel
In the ferris wheel
