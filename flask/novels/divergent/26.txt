Ferris Wheel Lyrics

Hey, I don't know what to say
I think of you each day
And in my loneliness
I don't know what is best

Maybe I might pretend
I'm going round the bend
And many a lot will heal
On the ferris wheel

Hey, I'm losing it again
A lack of oxygen
I'll take you for a ride
And sit with you inside

Maybe I might pretend
I'm going round the bend
And many a lot will heal
On the ferris wheel

Maybe I might pretend
I'm going round the bend
And many a lot will heal
On the ferris wheel
