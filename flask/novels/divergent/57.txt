Christina Lyrics

Christina can make you feel so groovy
Christina will make you almost burn
But Christina can only try and fool ya
Cause you know Christine ain't too good

Christina, moving like a river
Christina can never turn around
And Christina, well, no one comes to see ya
Cause you know Christine can't be found

I had a dream about you, Christine
I dreamt that flowers growing sideways so green
And butterflies covered all of your head
And an angel slept beside your bed

Christina, if I could stop that river
Christina, I could let you know
Christina, I got that something for ya
And you know I can't let it go

I had a dream about you, Christine
I dreamt that flowers growing sideways so green
And butterflies covered all of your head
And an angel slept beside your bed
And an angel slept beside your bed

Christina
Christina
Christina
