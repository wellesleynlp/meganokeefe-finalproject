Christina Lyrics

If you had the real thing how would you tell?
Liars can say it all just as well
Every single word you've heard in vain
Baubles of gold, stars in your hair
Reflections that told you they were not there
And the diamonds on your cheeks have turned to flames

And up in the air
They would write your name there
But love would fall to pieces in the rain
Who would know better than you?
A hundred love letters and none of them true

Christina
Christina

It's a wondrous world of ridiculous things
With nothing so rare as the love that it brings
In the silence of a smile that understands
A piece of the action, pieces of gold
Everyone's paid well and does what they're told
For the simple daughter of a simple man

And up in the air
They would write your name there
But love would fall to pieces in the rain
Who would know better than you?
A hundred love letters and none of them true
