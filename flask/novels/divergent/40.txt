Two Losers Lyrics

Avoiding humiliation with you
Everything's worthless
Life's an ongoing joke
What good does hanging on actually do?
Endlessly walking away from mindless threats and abuse

Yeah. I agree big-time, we should get guns
And set up camp outside the school dining hall
As soon as the idiots come here for lunch
We'll have prepared a little treat for them all
