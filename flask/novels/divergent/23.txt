Ferris Wheel Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Ring in the new one
Break off the seal
I'm dizzy and lit up
Like a ferris wheel

[Verse 2]
Tea in the Sahara
I cut up my hand
Can't see for the brightness

[Chorus 1]
How the moonlight is a bitter gold
Oh, I don't want to die
But you never know
'Til you fail
Ferris wheel

[Chorus 2]
How the moonlight is a bitter gold
Oh, I don't want to die
But you never know
'Til you try
Ferris wheel

And you fail
