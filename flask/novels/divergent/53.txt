Christina Death Lyrics

She likes to sleep her nights with the window open wide
Just in case her Dark Prince would come by the silvery light
She lives with her two cats a "please no ads" sign on her door
Memories in her photo books some of them still a bit sore

Christina Death
Smokes cigarettes in her bed
Christina Death
Paints her lips every night blood red

She hates Christmas nights more than dressing up in white
The lightning's something she adores like Frankenstein's Bride
She's obsessed with the Hollywood Book of Dead church yards give her more
No room for the living in her heart cold as 1334

Christina Death
Smokes cigarettes in her bed
Christina Death
Paints her lips every night blood red
Christina Death
Drinks Absinth after giving head
Christina Death
I know you before we ever met
