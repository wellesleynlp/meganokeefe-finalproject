Auld Lang Syne (The Millenium mix) Lyrics

"The first words I spoke in the original phonograph, Mary had a little lamb. It s fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. " - THOMAS EDISON
(reciting a familiar nursery rhyme. He invented the phonograph, the light bulb, the motion picture projector, the stock market ticker, the alkaline storage battery and hundreds of other things.)
"The Distinguished Flying Cross upon Colonel Charles A. Lindberg"
(He made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20, 1927. He took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York and landed near Paris, France. The flight took thirty three and a half hours. Of course, he had to be awake the entire time, and alert enough to pilot a plane.)
"Today, paniced investors ordered their brokers to sell at whatever the price in the stock market crashed."
(In October, 1929, an over-valued stock market, with many owning shares purchased "on margin" or with borrowed money, crashed. Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now. The insurance companies began to exclude suicide as an acceptable cause of death for life insurance policies and/or wrote in a two year waiting period before benefits could be paid.)
"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." - PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
(From his first Inaugural Address, 3/4/33. In the depths of the Great Depression, the pessimism of the population and especially the business community kept things bad. Decisions based on a gloomy outlook caused things to get even worse. In that respect, the mood and expectation of bad times became a self-fulfilling prophecy.)
"Horrific place, ladies and gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, ooh, the humanity"
(Live radio account of the fire and crash of the German airship "Hindenburg." It happened 5/6/37 on the eve of the Second World War in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever built. It was filled with an enormous quantity of hydrogen. Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)
"Now, with the help and support of the woman I love." - KING EDWARD VIII (of England)
(Speech on 12/11/36, after he had announced that he was abdicating the throne of England to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson Spencer, an American socialite)
"Urging the people to evacuate the city as Martians approach."
(This is from the "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast. This episode of the "Mercury Theater on the Air" was aired on Halloween eve, 10/30/38. The story was written by Orson Wells. Only at the beginning of the radio show was it mentioned that this was fiction. People tuning in later had no idea it was not real. They thought that the Earth was being invaded by aliens from Mars, causing a multitude of suicides.)

(His death at the hands of Jack Ruby prevented any clear resolution of this crime. Numerous conspiracy theories have evolved because of this lack of information. When you see notorious criminals going to and from jail, with armed guards, wearing body armor themselves, this is where it started. As much as many would like to see these animals die, protecting them until the judicial process is completed is common practice.)

(Vice Presidential candidate)
"Senator, you re no Jack Kennedy." - SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN of Texas
(In the televised debate between Vice Presidential candidates, it is hard to imagine how any speech writer could have made such a disastrous blunder.
