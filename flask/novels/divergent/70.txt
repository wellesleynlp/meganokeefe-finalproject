Horror Vision Lyrics

See the unseen
Regret on a waisted faith
Phenomenin
Approachment rejected by
Shattered lies...
Disagreement explaod
Anger thought made
Disagreement exploud
Horror viosions they made from
Exhausted reserve ammunition
Scream turn to silence tearing
What goes on
Bleed the scar. bleed the scar of it
Self
Drown with the sadness
Reflected the unseparation flames
Unseparation flames
And it will burn
THE ANGER....!!!
Face the demon horror atack
Disnatle duckin head from the
World
You will npt survive from the
Anger
Psychotic rage beneath all f*ckin
Rage
Power absolute defiance
We will obliterate you
