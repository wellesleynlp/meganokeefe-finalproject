That's What I've Done Lyrics

I'm away to the city
Never thought I'd have to sell the farm
It's a shame, what a pity
Now I've got a condo for a barn
Came to town on my tractor
Didn't want to leave it there to rust
Now I drive to the office
Never was the kind to take the bus
Chickens on the chesterfield
Ducks on the duvet
Henry the horse is in the hall
They say that we should make the best
Of everything that comes
So that's what I've done
Got a call from my landlord
Said that only dogs and cats could stay
He agreed to a treaty
As long as he got fresh eggs everyday
Cows are in the kitchen
And the sheep are on the shelves
Henry the horse is in the hall
They say that we should make the best
Of everything that comes
So that's what I've done
Of all the jobs moving to the city
Farming is the easiest to take
For if I were a fisherman
Surely I would have to bring a lake
Donkeys in the dining room
Pigs are by the pool
Henry the horse is in the hall
They say that we should make the best
Of everything that comes
So that's what I've done
