Apartment Lyrics

Im runnin away from Cinderella
Dont want to go to Rapunzels hairdresser
Get me outta this
This, this here fairytale
According to me dreams are hell
I dont wanna kiss that faggot froggy
Dont want to fall in love
With the beast or the beauty
Get me outta this
This, this here fairytale
According to me dreams are hell
All I want is an Apartment
All I need is an Apartment
If youve any leads on an Apartment
Tell me please
Cause Im runnin away from Cinderella
I dont wanna fly on a dragon
God knows Ive had so many drags
So many of them
Get me outta this
This, this here fairytale
According to me real life is swell
All I need is an Apartment
All I want is an Apartment
If youve any leads on an Apartment
Tell me please
Cause Im runnin away
Im runnin away
Im runnin away from Cinderella
