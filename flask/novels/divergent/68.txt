The Fifth Illusion Lyrics

Excavate the ancient tomp
Expansion of my doom
Converge to the empty coffin

A kingdom under catacomb
Furrowed background
Self - Abnegation
And a flute to paint the atmosphere

The fifth illusion
Self delusion of reality
The fifth illusion
Prison warder for your dreams

A kingdom under catacomb
Furrowed background
Neutralize your fantasy
Banishment
Spiritual abusement
His excellence

The fifth illusion
Self delusion of reality
The fifth illusion
Prison warder for your dreams
