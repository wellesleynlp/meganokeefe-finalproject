After these angles have been noted, it must be observed in what manner the malefic planets may be configurated with them: for, if both the malefics, or even if one of them, should be stationed bodily on any of the successive degrees composing the said angles, or be configurated with such degrees in quartile or in opposition, some bodily disorders or injuries will attach to the native or person then born and this will especially happen if, also, both the luminaries, either together or in opposition, or even if one of them, should be angularly posited in the manner described. Because, in such a case, not only a malefic which may have ascended in succession to the luminaries, but also any one which may have pre-ascended, if placed in an angle, has power to inflict certain diseases and injuries, such as may be indicated by the places of the horizon and of the signs, as well as by the natures of the planets themselves; whether malefics, or others evilly afflicted and configurated with them.\n\nSuch parts of the signs, as contain the afflicted part of the horizon, will show in what part of the body the misfortune will exist, whether it be a hurt, or disease, or both: and the natures of the planets, in operating the misfortune, also regulate its particular form or species. For, among the chief parts of the human body, Saturn rules the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones; Jupiter governs the hand, the lungs, the arteries, and the seed; Mars, the left ear, the kidneys, the veins, and the privities; the Sun rules the eyes, the brain, the heart, the sinews or nerves, and all the right side; Venus, the nostrils, the liver, and the flesh; Mercury, the speech, the under-standing, the bile, the tongue, and the fundament; and the Moon governs the palate, the throat, the stomach, the belly, the womb, and all the left parts.\n\nIt generally happens that some casual hurt, or injurious affection of the body, is the utmost that takes effect when the malefics may be oriental, and that considerable diseases occur only when the malefics may be occidental. And a hurt is distinct from a disease, inasmuch as the pain, which it induces at the time, is not afterwards continued; while a disease is, on the other hand, imposed on the sufferer either constantly or at repeated intervals. These remarks are applicable to all cases; but, in order to inquire particularly into the nature of the hurt or disease, a further attention must be paid to the figures, or schemes, with which the effects, about to be produced, will for the most part correspond in character.\n\nFor instance, blindness of one eye will ensue, when the Moon may be in the before-mentioned angles, either operating her conjunction, or being at the full: it will also happen should she be configurated with the Sun in any other proportional aspect, and be at the same time connected with any one of the nebulous collections in the zodiac; such as the cloudy spot of Cancer, the Pleiades of Taurus, the arrow-head of Sagittarius, the sting of Scorpio, the parts about the mane of Leo, or the urn of Aquarius. Moreover, both eyes will be injured should the Moon be in an angle, and in her decrease, and Mars or Saturn, being matutine, ascend in succession to her; or, again, if the Sun be in an angle, and these planets pre-ascend before him, and be configurated with both luminaries, whether the luminaries be in one and the same sign, or in opposition; provided also the said planets, although oriental of the Sun, be occidental of the Moon. Under these circumstances, therefore, Mars will cause blindness by a stroke or blow, or by the sword or by burning; and, if he be configurated with Mercury, it will be effected\neither in a place of exercise or sport, or by the assault of robbers. Saturn, however, under the same circumstances, produces blindness by cataract, or cold, by a white film, or by other similar disorders.\n\nVenus, if in one of the angles before-mentioned, and especially if she be in that of the west, and Saturn be in conjunction or in configuration with her, or be changing place with her, 1 while Mars, at the same time, is in elevation above her, or in opposition to her, will produce impotence in the native, if a male; and, if a female, will render her liable to abortion, or to produce children stillborn, or not capable of being extracted except in mangled parts. Such misfortunes especially happen under Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn; even though the Moon may be in the ascendant, in conjunction with Mars. And if, under the same circumstances, Venus be also configurated with Mercury, as well as Saturn, Mars again being in elevation above her, or in opposition to her, the native will be either an eunuch or hermaphrodite, or devoid of the natural channels and vents. And, when these positions occur, should the Sun also partake in the configuration, the luminaries and Venus being all masculinely constituted, the Moon in her decrease, and the malefics brought up in the degrees next successively ascending, the males will be born maimed or crippled, or injured in their private members (particularly under Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Aquarius); and the females will remain childless and unprolific. And it also occasionally happens that the natives, under such a configuration, are likewise injured in the face or eyes.\n\nIf Saturn and Mercury, in conjunction with the Sun, be in the before-mentioned angles, the native will have some defect in the tongue, and stammer or speak with difficulty: especially if Mercury be occidental, and both he and Saturn configurated with the Moon. Should Mars, however, be found together with them, he will for the most part remove the defect in the tongue, after the Moon shall have completed her approach to him.\n\nFurther, should the malefics be in angles, and the luminaries, either together or in opposition, be brought up to them; or, if the malefics be brought up to the luminaries, especially when the Moon may be in her nodes, or in her bend, or in obnoxious signs, such as Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio, and Capricorn, the body will then be afflicted with excrescences, distortions, lameness or paralysis.\n\nIf the malefics be in conjunction with the luminaries, the calamity will take effect from the very moment of birth: but should they be in the mid-heaven, in elevation above the luminaries, or in opposition to each other, it will then arise out of some great and dangerous\naccident; such as a fall from some height or precipice, an attack of robbers, or of quadrupeds. And thus, if Mars hold dominion, he will produce the misfortune by means of fire or wounds, through quarrels, or by robbers; and if Saturn, it will be caused by a fall, by shipwreck, or by convulsive fits or spasms.\n\nThe minor bodily disorders mostly occur on the Moon's being posited in a tropical or equinoctial sign; and, if in that of the vernal equinox, these disorders usually arise from the white leprosy; in that of the summer tropic, from tetters; in that of the autumnal equinox, from leprosy; and in that of the winter tropic, from the eruption of pimples, and similar inconveniences.\n\nConsiderable diseases, however, take effect when the malefics may be configurated in the same situations as those before prescribed, yet differing in one respect; that is to say, being occidental of the Sun and oriental of the Moon. In such cases, Saturn will generally produce cold in the bowels, excessive phlegm, rheumatism, emaciation, sickliness, jaundice, dysentry, cough, obstruction, colic, or scurvy; and, in women, besides these diseases, he produces complaints of the womb. Mars will cause expectoration of blood, atrabilarious attacks, pulmonary complaints, sores, and diseases in the private parts (which will be rendered still more painful by surgical burning or incision), such as fistula, h\u00e6morrhoids, or knots in the fundament, and also inflamed and putrifying ulcers. In women, to these calamities, he adds abortion, excision of the f\u0153tus or its mortification.\n\nAnd, even though these planets should not be properly configurated towards the particular parts of the body, their qualities will still operate. Mercury also will act with them, and contribute to the increase of the evil: thus, if he be in familiarity with Saturn, he will much augment the coldness, and promote the continuance of rheumatism, and the disturbance of the fluids; especially in the chest, throat, and stomach. If in familiarity with Mars, he will tend to produce greater dryness, and will increase ulcers, abscesses, loss of hair, scarified sores, erysipelas, tetters, blackness of bile, insanity, epilepsy, 1 and similar disorders.\n\nSome of the properties, peculiar to disease, arise out of the various character of the signs which may contain the above-mentioned configurations in the two angles. Thus Cancer, Capricorn, and Pisces, and, in short, all signs ascribed to terrestrial animals and fishes, appropriately cause diseases of putridity, tetters, excoriation, scrofula, fistula, leprosy, and the like; while Sagittarius and Gemini produce disease by falling fits and epilepsy. And if the planets happen to be posited in the latter degrees of the signs containing them, the extremities of the body will then be chiefly affected by the disease or hurt; which will arise from humours or accidents, producing leprosy, gout, or other infirmities, in the hands and feet.\n\nUnder the circumstances above detailed, the disease or hurt will be incurable, provided there shall be not one of the benefics in configuration with the malefics which effect the evil, nor with the luminaries posited in angles; and even though the benefics may be so configurated, the misfortune will still be incapable of remedy, if the malefics be well fortified, and in elevation above them.\n\nShould the benefics, however, hold principal situations, and be in elevation above the obnoxious malefics, the disease or hurt will then be moderate, and have neither deformity nor disgrace attached to it; and it will sometimes be altogether prevented and set aside, if the benefics be oriental. Jupiter, for instance, by means of human aid, such as wealth or rank can command, will conceal and soothe hurts and diseases; and, if Mercury be joined with him, the assistance will be further improved by the addition of skilful physicians and good medicine. Venus, likewise, through the mediation of deities and oracles, will cause hurts to appear in a manner neither ungraceful nor unbecoming, and will ameliorate diseases by medicines granted by the gods.\n\nLastly, should Saturn be present in the configuration, the afflicted persons will move abroad to show their maladies, and to complain; and if Mercury also be present, they will do so for the sake of deriving support and profit from the exhibition.", "http://genius.com/Ptolemy-ptolemys-tetrabiblos-book-3-ch-17-annotated"], "2413971": ["Eternal by\u00a0Abbath", "Eternal Lyrics\n\n[Verse 1]\nPhoenix in a frozen flame\nTrapped in Arctic, Winter crypt\nScars of past have cast the chains\nFrom Book of Ages we are ripped\nRaven glide on Polar, winds\nHailstones sharp shards of glass\nBanish thoughts of lesser men\nIn the end flesh is grass\n\n[Chorus]\nDivided we fall\nUnited we rule\nHybrid stand tall\nIgnite freak with fool\n\n[Verse 2]\nPhoenix soar as sunlight thaws\nGlacier and frigid earth\nShake the ice from fiery mane\nTorch the skies emblazon birth\nRaven dive through lightning strike\nWhip cirrus into swell\nPierced by deadly shrike\nSpirit flies, no man can fell\n\n[Chorus]\nDivided we fall\nUnited we rule\nSteadfast we toil\nRebellion our tool\n\n[Bridge]\nDauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless\nDauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoenix rise and conquer Time\nTemper fate\nReclaim the zeitgeist in its prime\nRejuvenate\nRaven dive through lightning strike\nWhip cirrus into swell\nPierced by shrike\nSpirit flies, no man can fell\n\n[Chorus]\nDivided we fall\nUnited we rule\nSteadfast we toil\nRebellion our tool\n\nDauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless\nDauntless Fearless Tireless Relentless", "http://genius.com/Abbath-eternal-lyrics"], "48148": ["Nobody Sound Like Me by\u00a0Xzibit (Ft.\u00a0Montage\u00a0One)", "Nobody Sound Like Me Lyrics\n\nIntro:\nInterviewer:\nIf you saw you walking on a street and a\nBlack man were comin' torward you\nWhat would you be feeling?\n\nScared man:\nJust one single black man?

wrote to a friend in the year 1897: \"In strict confidence . . . I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.\"\n\nThe year of the massacre at Wounded Knee, 1890, it was officially declared by the Bureau of the Census that the internal frontier was closed. The profit system, with its natural tendency for expansion, had already begun to look overseas. The severe depression that began in 1893 strengthened an idea developing within the political and financial elite of the country: that overseas markets for American goods might relieve the problem of underconsumption at home and prevent the economic crises that in the 1890s brought class war.\n\nAnd would not a foreign adventure deflect some of the rebellious energy that went into strikes and protest movements toward an external enemy? Would it not unite people with government, with the armed forces, instead of against them? This was probably not a conscious plan among most of the elite -- but a natural development from the twin drives of capitalism and nationalism.\n\nExpansion overseas was not a new idea. Even before the war against Mexico carried the United States to the Pacific, the Monroe Doctrine looked southward into and beyond the Caribbean. Issued in 1823 when the countries of Latin America were winning independence from Spanish control, it made plain to European nations that the United States considered Latin America its sphere of influence. Not long after, some Americans began thinking into the Pacific: of Hawaii, Japan, and the great markets of China.\n\nThere was more than thinking; the American armed forces had made forays overseas. A State Department list, \"Instances of the Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad 1798-1945\" (presented by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to a Senate committee in 1962 to cite precedents for the use of armed force against Cuba), shows 103 interventions in the affairs of other countries between 1798 and 1895. A sampling from the list, with the exact description given by the State Department:\n\n1852-53 -- Argentina -- Marines were landed and maintained in Buenos Aires to protect American interests during a revolution.\n1853 -- Nicaragua -- to protect American lives and interests during political disturbances.\n1853-54 -- Japan -- The \"Opening of Japan\" and the Perry Expedition. [The State Department does not give more details, but this involved the use of warships to force Japan to open its ports to the United States]\n1853-54 -- Ryukyu and Bonin Islands -- Commodore Perry on three visits before going to Japan and while waiting for a reply from Japan made a naval demonstration, landing marines twice, and secured a coaling concession from the ruler of Naha on Okinawa. He also demonstrated in the Bonin Islands. All to secure facilities for commerce.\n1854 -- Nicaragua -- San Juan del Norte [Greytown was destroyed to avenge an insult to the American Minister to Nicaragua.]\n1855 -- Uruguay -- U.S. and European naval forces landed to protect American interests during an attempted revolution in Montevideo.\n1859 -- China -- For the protection of American interests in Shanghai.\n1860 -- Angola, Portuguese West Africa -- To protect American lives and property at Kissembo when the natives became troublesome.\n1893 -- Hawaii -- Ostensibly to protect American lives and property; actually to promote a provisional government under Sanford B. Dole This action was disavowed by the United States.\n1894 -- Nicaragua -- To protect American interests at Bluefields following a revolution.\n\nThus, by the 1890s, there had been much experience in overseas probes and interventions. The ideology of expansion was widespread in the upper circles of military men, politicians, businessmen -- and even among some of the leaders of farmers' movements who thought foreign markets would help them.\n\nCaptain A. T. Mahan of the U.S. navy, a popular propagandist for expansion, greatly influenced Theodore Roosevelt and other American leaders. The countries with the biggest navies would inherit the earth, he said. \"Americans must now begin to look outward.\" Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts wrote in a magazine article:\n\nIn the interests of our commerce . . . we should build the Nicaragua canal, and for the protection of that canal and for the sake of our commercial supremacy in the Pacific we should control the Hawaiian islands and maintain our influence in Samoa . . . and when the Nicaraguan canal is built, the island of Cuba . . . will become a necessity. . . . The great nations are rapidly absorbing for their future expansion and their present defense all the waste places of the earth. It is a movement which makes for civilization and the advancement of the race. As one of the great nations of the world the United States must not fall out of the line of march.\n\nA Washington Post editorial on the eve of the Spanish-American war:\n\nA new consciousness seems to have come upon us -- the consciousness of strength -- and with it a new appetite, the yearning to show our strength. . . . Ambition, interest, land hunger, pride, the mere joy of fighting, whatever it may be, we are animated by a new sensation. We are face to face with a strange destiny. The taste of Empire is in the mouth of the people even as the taste of blood in the jungle. . . .\n\nWas that taste in the mouth of the people through some instinctive lust for aggression or some urgent self-interest? Or was it a taste (if indeed it existed) created, encouraged, advertised, and exaggerated by the millionaire press, the military, the government, the eager-to-please scholars of the time? Political scientist John Burgess of Columbia University said the Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon races were \"particularly endowed with the capacity for establishing national states . . . they are entrusted . . . with the mission of conducting the political civilization of the modern world.\"\n\nSeveral years before his election to the presidency, William McKinley said: \"We want a foreign market for our surplus products.\" Senator Albert Beveridge of Indiana in early 1897 declared: \"American factories are making more than the American people can use; American soil is producing more than they can consume. Fate has written our policy for us; the trade of the world must and shall be ours.\" The Department of State explained in 1898:\n\nIt seems to be conceded that every year we shall be confronted with an increasing surplus of manufactured goods for sale in foreign markets if American operatives and artisans are to be kept employed the year around. The enlargement of foreign consumption of the products of our mills and workshops has, therefore, become a serious problem of statesmanship as well as of commerce.\n\nThese expansionist military men and politicians were in touch with one another. One of Theodore Roosevelt's biographers tells us: \"By 1890, Lodge, Roosevelt, and Mahan had begun exchanging views,\" and that they tried to get Mahan off sea duty \"so that he could continue full-time his propaganda for expansion.\" Roosevelt once sent Henry Cabot Lodge a copy of a poem by Rudyard Kipling, saying it was \"poor poetry, but good sense from the expansionist standpoint.\"\n\nWhen the United States did not annex Hawaii in 1893 after some Americans (the combined missionary and pineapple interests of the Dole family) set up their own government, Roosevelt called this hesitancy \"a crime against white civilization.\" And he told the Naval War College: \"All the great masterful races have been fighting races. . . . No triumph of peace is quite so great as the supreme triumph of war.\"\n\nRoosevelt was contemptuous of races and nations he considered inferior. When a mob in New Orleans lynched a number of Italian immigrants, Roosevelt thought the United States should offer the Italian government some remuneration, but privately he wrote his sister that he thought the lynching was \"rather a good thing\" and told her he had said as much at a dinner with \"various dago diplomats . . . all wrought up by the lynching.\"\n\nWilliam James, the philosopher, who became one of the leading anti-imperialists of his time, wrote about Roosevelt that he \"gushes over war as the ideal condition of human society, for the manly strenuousness which it involves, and treats peace as a condition of blubberlike and swollen ignobility, fit only for huckstering weaklings, dwelling in gray twilight and heedless of the higher life. . . .\"\n\nRoosevelt's talk of expansionism was not just a matter of manliness and heroism; he was conscious of \"our trade relations with China.\" Lodge was aware of the textile interests in Massachusetts that looked to Asian markets. Historian Marilyn Young has written of the work of the American China Development Company to expand American influence in China for commercial reasons, and of State Department instructions to the American emissary in China to \"employ all proper methods for the extension of American interests in China.\" She says (The Rhetoric of Empire) that the talk about markets in China was far greater than the actual amount of dollars involved at the time, but this talk was important in shaping American policy toward Hawaii, the Philippines, and all of Asia.\n\nWhile it was true that in 1898, 90 percent of American products were sold at home, the 10 percent sold abroad amounted to a billion dollars. Walter Lafeber writes (The New Empire): \"By 1893, American trade exceeded that of every country in the world except England. Farm products, of course, especially in the key tobacco, cotton, and wheat areas, had long depended heavily on international markets for their prosperity.\" And in the twenty years up to 1895, new investments by American capitalists overseas reached a billion dollars. In 1885, the steel industry's publication Age of Steel wrote that the internal markets were insufficient and the overproduction of industrial products \"should be relieved and prevented in the future by increased foreign trade.\"\n\nOil became a big export in the 1880s and 1890s: by 1891, the Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company accounted for 90 percent of American exports of kerosene and controlled 70 percent of the world market. Oil was now second to cotton as the leading product sent overseas.\n\nThere were demands for expansion by large commercial farmers, including some of the Populist leaders, as William Appleman Williams has shown in The Roots of the Modern American Empire. Populist Congressman Jerry Simpson of Kansas told Congress in 1892 that with a huge agricultural surplus, farmers \"must of necessity seek a foreign market.\" True, he was not calling for aggression or conquest -- but once foreign markets were seen as important to prosperity, expansionist policies, even war, might have wide appeal.\n\nSuch an appeal would be especially strong if the expansion looked like an act of generosity -- helping a rebellious group overthrow foreign rule -- as in Cuba. By 1898, Cuban rebels had been fighting their Spanish conquerors for three years in an attempt to win independence. By that time, it was possible to create a national mood for intervention.\n\nIt seems that the business interests of the nation did not at first want military intervention in Cuba. American merchants did not need colonies or wars of conquest if they could just have free access to markets. This idea of an \"open door\" became the dominant theme of American foreign policy in the twentieth century. It was a more sophisticated approach to imperialism than the traditional empire-building of Europe. William Appleman Williams, in The Tragedy of American Diplomacy, says:\n\nThis national argument is usually interpreted as a battle between imperialists led by Roosevelt and Lodge and anti-imperialists led by William Jennings Bryan and Carl Schurz. It is far more accurate and illuminating, however, to view it as a three-cornered fight. The third group was a coalition of businessmen, intellectuals, and politicians who opposed traditional colonialism and advocated instead a policy of an open door through which America's preponderant economic strength would enter and dominate all underdeveloped areas of the world.\n\nHowever, this preference on the part of some business groups and politicians for what Williams calls the idea of \"informal empire,\" without war, was always subject to change. If peaceful imperialism turned out to be impossible, military action might be needed.\n\nFor instance, in late 1897 and early 1898, with China weakened by a recent war with Japan, German military forces occupied the Chinese port of Tsingtao at the mouth of Kiaochow Bay and demanded a naval station there, with rights to railways and coal mines on the nearby peninsula of Shantung. Within the next few months, other European powers moved in on China, and the partition of China by the major imperialist powers was under way, with the United States left behind.\n\nAt this point, the New York Journal of Commerce, which had advocated peaceful development of free trade, now urged old-fashioned military colonialism. Julius Pratt, a historian of U.S. expansionism, describes the turnabout:\n\nThis paper, which has been heretofore characterized as pacifist, anti-imperialist, and devoted to the development of commerce in a free-trade world, saw the foundation of its faith crumbling as a result of the threatened partition of China. Declaring that free access to the markets of China, with its 400,000,000 people, would largely solve the problem of the disposal of our surplus manufactures, the Journal came out not only for a stern insistence upon complete equality of rights in China but unreservedly also for an isthmian canal, the acquisition of Hawaii, and a material increase in the navy -- three measures which it had hitherto strenuously opposed. Nothing could be more significant than the manner in which this paper was converted in a few weeks. . . .\n\nThere was a similar turnabout in U.S. business attitudes on Cuba in 1898. Businessmen had been interested, from the start of the Cuban revolt against Spain, in the effect on commercial possibilities there. There already was a substantial economic interest in the island, which President Grover Cleveland summarized in 1896:\n\nIt is reasonably estimated that at least from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in the plantations and in railroad, mining, and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000.\n\nPopular support of the Cuban revolution was based on the thought that they, like the Americans of 1776, were fighting a war for their own liberation. The United States government, however, the conservative product of another revolutionary war, had power and profit in mind as it observed the events in Cuba. Neither Cleveland, President during the first years of the Cuban revolt, nor McKinley, who followed, recognized the insurgents officially as belligerents; such legal recognition would have enabled the United States to give aid to the rebels without sending an army. But there may have been fear that the rebels would win on their own and keep the United States out.\n\nThere seems also to have been another kind of fear. The Cleveland administration said a Cuban victory might lead to \"the establishment of a white and a black republic,\" since Cuba had a mixture of the two races. And the black republic might be dominant. This idea was expressed in 1896 in an article in The Saturday Review by a young and eloquent imperialist, whose mother was American and whose father was English -- Winston Churchill. He wrote that while Spanish rule was bad and the rebels had the support of the people, it would be better for Spain to keep control:\n\nA grave danger represents itself. Two-fifths of the insurgents in the field are negroes. These men . . . would, in the event of success, demand a predominant share in the government of the country . . . the result being, after years of fighting, another black republic.\n\nThe reference to \"another\" black republic meant Haiti, whose revolution against France in 1803 had led to the first nation run by blacks in the New World. The Spanish minister to the United States wrote to the U.S. Secretary of State:\n\nIn this revolution, the negro element has the most important part. Not only the principal leaders are colored men, but at least eight-tenths of their supporters. . . . and the result of the war, if the Island can be declared independent, will be a secession of the black element and a black Republic.\n\nAs Philip Foner says in his two-volume study The Spanish-Cuban-American War, \"The McKinley Administration had plans for dealing with the Cuban situation, but these did not include independence for the island.\" He points to the administration's instructions to its minister to Spain, Stewart Woodford, asking him to try to settle the war because it \"injuriously affects the normal function of business, and tends to delay the condition of prosperity,\" but not mentioning freedom and justice for the Cubans. Foner explains the rush of the McKinley administration into war (its ultimatum gave Spain little time to negotiate) by the fact that \"if the United States waited too long, the Cuban revolutionary forces would emerge victorious, replacing the collapsing Spanish regime.\"\n\nIn February 1898, the U.S. battleship Maine, in Havana harbor as a symbol of American interest in the Cuban events, was destroyed by a mysterious explosion and sank, with the loss of 268 men. There was no evidence ever produced on the cause of the explosion, but excitement grew swiftly in the United States, and McKinley began to move in the direction of war. Walter Lafeber says:\n\nThe President did not want war; he had been sincere and tireless in his efforts to maintain the peace. By mid-March, however, he was beginning to discover that, although he did not want war, he did want what only a war could provide; the disappearance of the terrible uncertainty in American political and economic life, and a solid basis from which to resume the building of the new American commercial empire.\n\nAt a certain point in that spring, both McKinley and the business community began to see that their object, to get Spain out of Cuba, could not be accomplished without war, and that their accompanying object, the securing of American military and economic influence in Cuba, could not be left to the Cuban rebels, but could be ensured only by U.S. intervention. The New York Commercial Advertiser, at first against war, by March 10 asked intervention in Cuba for \"humanity and love of freedom, and above all, the desire that the commerce and industry of every part of the world shall have full freedom of development in the whole world's interest.\"\n\nBefore this, Congress had passed the Teller Amendment, pledging the United States not to annex Cuba. It was initiated and supported by those people who were interested in Cuban independence and opposed to American imperialism, and also by business people who saw the \"open door\" as sufficient and military intervention unnecessary. But by the spring of 1898, the business community had developed a hunger for action. The Journal of Commerce said: \"The Teller amendment . . . must be interpreted in a sense somewhat different from that which its author intended it to bear.\"\n\nThere were special interests who would benefit directly from war. In Pittsburgh, center of the iron industry, the Chamber of Commerce advocated force, and the Chattanooga Tradesman said that the possibility of war \"has decidedly stimulated the iron trade.\" It also noted that \"actual war would very decidedly enlarge the business of transportation.\" In Washington, it was reported that a \"belligerent spirit\" had infected the Navy Department, encouraged \"by the contractors for projectiles, ordnance, ammunition and other supplies, who have thronged the department since the destruction of the Maine.\"\n\nRussell Sage, the banker, said that if war came, \"There is no question as to where the rich men stand.\" A survey of businessmen said that John Jacob Astor, William Rockefeller, and Thomas Fortune Ryan were \"feeling militant.\" And J. P. Morgan believed further talk with Spain would accomplish nothing.\n\nOn March 21, 1898, Henry Cabot Lodge wrote McKinley a long letter, saying he had talked with \"bankers, brokers, businessmen, editors, clergymen and others\" in Boston, Lynn, and Nahant, and \"everybody,\" including \"the most conservative classes,\" wanted the Cuban question \"solved.\" Lodge reported: \"They said for business one shock and then an end was better than a succession of spasms such as we must have if this war in Cuba went on.\" On March 25, a telegram arrived at the White House from an adviser to McKinley, saying: \"Big corporations here now believe we will have war. Believe all would welcome it as relief to suspense.\"\n\nTwo days after getting this telegram, McKinley presented an ultimatum to Spain, demanding an armistice. He said nothing about independence for Cuba. A spokesman for the Cuban rebels, part of a group of Cubans in New York, interpreted this to mean the U.S. simply wanted to replace Spain. He responded:\n\nIn the face of the present proposal of intervention without previous recognition of independence, it is necessary for us to go a step farther and say that we must and will regard such intervention as nothing less than a declaration of war by the United States against the Cuban revolutionists. . . .\n\nIndeed, when McKinley asked Congress for war on April 11, he did not recognize the rebels as belligerents or ask for Cuban independence. Nine days later, Congress, by joint resolution, gave McKinley the power to intervene. When American forces moved into Cuba, the rebels welcomed them, hoping the Teller Amendment would guarantee Cuban independence.\n\nMany histories of the Spanish-American war have said that \"public opinion\" in the United States led McKinley to declare war on Spain and send forces to Cuba. True, certain influential newspapers had been pushing hard, even hysterically. And many Americans, seeing the aim of intervention as Cuban independence -- and with the Teller Amendment as guarantee of this intention -- supported the idea. But would McKinley have gone to war because of the press and some portion of the public (we had no public opinion surveys at that time) without the urging of the business community? Several years after the Cuban war, the chief of the Bureau of Foreign Commerce of the Department of Commerce wrote about that period:\n\nUnderlying the popular sentiment, which might have evaporated in time, which forced the United States to take up arms against Spanish rule in Cuba, were our economic relations with the West Indies and the South American republics. . . . The Spanish-American War was but an incident of a general movement of expansion which had its roots in the changed environment of an industrial capacity far beyond our domestic powers of consumption. It was seen to be necessary for us not only to find foreign purchasers for our goods, but to provide the means of making access to foreign markets easy, economical and safe.\n\nAmerican labor unions had sympathy for the Cuban rebels as soon as the insurrection against Spain began in 1895. But they opposed American expansionism. Both the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor spoke against the idea of annexing Hawaii, which McKinley proposed in 1897. Despite the feeling for the Cuban rebels, a resolution calling for U.S. intervention was defeated at the 1897 convention of the AFL. Samuel Gompers of the AFL wrote to a friend: \"The sympathy of our movement with Cuba is genuine, earnest, and sincere, but this does not for a moment imply that we are committed to certain adventurers who are apparently suffering from Hysteria. . . .\"\n\nWhen the explosion of the Maine in February led to excited calls for war in the press, the monthly journal of the International Association of Machinists agreed it was a terrible disaster, but it noted that the deaths of workers in industrial accidents drew no such national clamor. It pointed to the Lattimer Massacre of September 10, 1897, during a coal strike in Pennsylvania. Miners marching on a highway to the Lattimer mine -- Austrians, Hungarians, Italians, Germans -- who had originally been imported as strikebreakers but then organized themselves, refused to disperse, whereupon the sheriff and his deputies opened fire, killing nineteen of them, most shot in the back, with no outcry in the press. The labor journal said that the\n\n. . . carnival of carnage that takes place every day, month and year in the realm of industry, the thousands of useful lives that are annually sacrificed to the Moloch of greed, the blood tribute paid by labor to capitalism, brings forth no shout for vengeance and reparation. . . . Death comes in thousands of instances in mill and mine, claims his victims, and no popular uproar is heard.\n\nThe official organ of the Connecticut AFL, The Craftsman, also warned about the hysteria worked up by the sinking of the Maine:\n\nA gigantic . . . and cunningly-devised scheme is being worked ostensibly to place the United States in the front rank as a naval and military power. The real reason is that the capitalists will have the whole thing and, when any workingmen dare to ask for the living wage . . . they will be shot down like dogs in the streets.\n\nSome unions, like the United Mine Workers, called for U.S. intervention after the sinking of the Maine. But most were against war. The treasurer of the American Longshoremen's Union, Bolton Hall, wrote \"A Peace Appeal to Labor,\" which was widely circulated:\n\nIf there is a war, you will furnish the corpses and the taxes, and others will get the glory. Speculators will make money out of it -- that is, out of you. Men will get high prices for inferior supplies, leaky boats, for shoddy clothes and pasteboard shoes, and you will have to pay the bill, and the only satisfaction you will get is the privilege of hating your Spanish fellow-workmen, who are really your brothers and who have had as little to do with the wrongs of Cuba as you have.\n\nSocialists opposed the war. One exception was the Jewish Daily Forward. The People, newspaper of the Socialist Labor party, called the issue of Cuban freedom \"a pretext\" and said the government wanted war to \"distract the attention of the workers from their real interests.\" The Appeal to Reason, another Socialist newspaper, said the movement for war was \"a favorite method of rulers for keeping the people from redressing domestic wrongs.\" In the San Francisco Voice of Labor a Socialist wrote: \"It is a terrible thing to think that the poor workers of this country should be sent to kill and wound the poor workers of Spain merely because a few leaders may incite them to do so.\"\n\nBut after war was declared, Foner says, \"the majority of the trade unions succumbed to the war fever.\" Samuel Gompers called the war \"glorious and righteous\" and claimed that 250,000 trade unionists had volunteered for military service. The United Mine Workers pointed to higher coal prices as a result of the war and said: \"The coal and iron trades have not been so healthy for some years past as at present.\"\n\nThe war brought more employment and higher wages, but also higher prices. Foner says: \"Not only was there a startling increase in the cost of living, but, in the absence of an income tax, the poor found themselves paying almost entirely for the staggering costs of the war through increased levies on sugar, molasses, tobacco, and other taxes. . . .\" Gompers, publicly for the war, privately pointed out that the war had led to a 20 percent reduction of the purchasing power of workers' wages.\n\nOn May Day, 1898, the Socialist Labor party organized an antiwar parade in New York City, but the authorities would not allow it to take place, while a May Day parade called by the Jewish Daily Forward, urging Jewish workers to support the war, was permitted. The Chicago Labor World said: \"This has been a poor man's war -- paid for by the poor man. The rich have profited by it, as they always do. . . .\"\n\nThe Western Labor Union was founded at Salt Lake City on May 10, 1898, because the AFL had not organized unskilled workers. It wanted to bring together all workers \"irrespective of occupation, nationality, creed or color\" and \"sound the death knell of every corporation and trust that has robbed the American laborer of the fruits of his toil. . . .\" The union's publication, noting the annexation of Hawaii during the war, said this proved that \"the war which started as one of relief for the starving Cubans has suddenly changed to one of conquest.\"\n\nThe prediction made by longshoreman Bolton Hall, of wartime corruption and profiteering, turned out to be remarkably accurate. Richard Morris's Encyclopedia of American History gives startling figures:\n\nOf the more than 274,000 officers and men who served in the army during the Spanish-American War and the period of demobilization, 5,462 died in the various theaters of operation and in camps in the U.S. Only 379 of the deaths were battle casualties, the remainder being attributed to disease and other causes.\n\nThe same figures are given by Walter Millis in his book The Martial Spirit. In the Encyclopedia they are given tersely, and without mention of the \"embalmed beef\" (an army general's term) sold to the army by the meatpackers -- meat preserved with boric acid, nitrate of potash, and artificial coloring matter.\n\nIn May of 1898, Armour and Company, the big meatpacking company of Chicago, sold the army 500,000 pounds of beef which had been sent to Liverpool a year earlier and had been returned. Two months later, an army inspector tested the Armour meat, which had been stamped and approved by an inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and found 751 cases containing rotten meat. In the first sixty cases he opened, he found fourteen tins already burst, \"the effervescent putrid contents of which were distributed all over the cases.\" (The description comes from the Report of the Commission to Investigate the Conduct of the War Department in the War with Spain, made to the Senate in 1900.) Thousands of soldiers got food poisoning. There are no figures on how many of the five thousand noncombat deaths were caused by that.\n\nThe Spanish forces were defeated in three months, in what John Hay, the American Secretary of State, later called a \"splendid little war.\" The American military pretended that the Cuban rebel army did not exist. When the Spanish surrendered, no Cuban was allowed to confer on the surrender, or to sign it. General William Shafter said no armed rebels could enter the capital city of Santiago, and told the Cuban rebel leader, General Calixto Garcia, that not Cubans, but the old Spanish civil authorities, would remain in charge of the municipal offices in Santiago.\n\nAmerican historians have generally ignored the role of the Cuban rebels in the war; Philip Foner, in his history, was the first to print Garcia's letter of protest to General Shafter:\n\nI have not been honored with a single word from yourself informing me about the negotiations for peace or the terms of the capitulation by the Spaniards.\n\n. . . when the question arises of appointing authorities in Santiago de Cuba . . . I cannot see but with the deepest regret that such authorities are not elected by the Cuban people, but are the same ones selected by the Queen of Spain. . . .\n\nA rumor too absurd to be believed, General, describes the reason of your measures and of the orders forbidding my army to enter Santiago for fear of massacres and revenge against the Spaniards. Allow me, sir, to protest against even the shadow of such an idea. We are not savages ignoring the rules of civilized warfare. We are a poor, ragged army, as ragged and poor as was the army of your forefathers in their noble war for independence. . . .\n\nAlong with the American army in Cuba came American capital. Foner writes:\n\nEven before the Spanish flag was down in Cuba, U.S. business interests set out to make their influence felt. Merchants, real estate agents, stock speculators, reckless adventurers, and promoters of all kinds of get-rich schemes flocked to Cuba by the thousands. Seven syndicates battled each other for control of the franchises for the Havana Street Railway, which were finally won by Percival Farquhar, representing the Wall Street interests of New York. Thus, simultaneously with the military occupation began . . . commercial occupation.\n\nThe Lumbermen's Review, spokesman for the lumber industry, said in the midst of the war: \"The moment Spain drops the reigns of government in Cuba . . . the moment will arrive for American lumber interests to move into the island for the products of Cuban forests. Cuba still possesses 10,000,000 acres of virgin forest abounding in valuable timber . . . nearly every foot of which would be saleable in the United States and bring high prices.\"\n\nAmericans began taking over railroad, mine, and sugar properties when the war ended. In a few years, $30 million of American capital was invested. United Fruit moved into the Cuban sugar industry. It bought 1,900,000 acres of land for about twenty cents an acre. The American Tobacco Company arrived. By the end of the occupation, in 1901, Foner estimates that at least 80 percent of the export of Cuba's minerals were in American hands, mostly Bethlehem Steel.\n\nDuring the military occupation a series of strikes took place. In September 1899, a gathering of thousands of workers in Havana launched a general strike for the eight-hour day, saying, \". . . we have determined to promote the struggle between the worker and the capitalist. For the workers of Cuba will no longer tolerate remaining in total subjection.\" The American General William Ludlow ordered the mayor of Havana to arrest eleven strike leaders, and U.S. troops occupied railroad stations and docks. Police moved through the city breaking up meetings. But the economic activity of the city had come to a halt. Tobacco workers struck. Printers struck. Bakers went on strike. Hundreds of strikers were arrested, and some of the imprisoned leaders were intimidated into calling for an end to the strike.\n\nThe United States did not annex Cuba. But a Cuban Constitutional Convention was told that the United States army would not leave Cuba until the Platt Amendment, passed by Congress in February 1901, was incorporated into the new Cuban Constitution. This Amendment gave the United States \"the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence, the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property, and individual liberty. . . . \" It also provided for the United States to get coaling or naval stations at certain specified points.\n\nThe Teller Amendment and the talk of Cuban freedom before and during the war had led many Americans -- and Cubans -- to expect genuine independence. The Platt Amendment was now seen, not only by the radical and labor press, but by newspapers and groups all over the United States, as a betrayal. A mass meeting of the American Anti-Imperialist League at Faneuil Hall in Boston denounced it, ex-governor George Boutwell saying: \"In disregard of our pledge of freedom and sovereignty to Cuba we are imposing on that island conditions of colonial vassalage.\"\n\nIn Havana, a torchlight procession of fifteen thousand Cubans marched on the Constitutional Convention, urging them to reject the Amendment. But General Leonard Wood, head of the occupation forces, assured McKinley: \"The people of Cuba lend themselves readily to all sorts of demonstrations and parades, and little significance should be attached to them.\"\n\nA committee was delegated by the Constitutional Convention to reply to the United States' insistence that the Platt Amendment be included in the Constitution. The committee report, Penencia a la Convencion, was written by a black delegate from Santiago. It said:\n\nFor the United States to reserve to itself the power to determine when this independence was threatened, and when, therefore, it should intervene to preserve it, is equivalent to handing over the keys to our house so that they can enter it at any time, whenever the desire seizes them, day or night, whether with good or evil design.\n\nAnd:\n\nThe only Cuban governments that would live would be those which count on the support and benevolence of the United States, and the clearest result of this situation would be that we would only have feeble and miserable governments . . . condemned to live more attentive to obtaining the blessings of the United States than to serving and defending the interests of Cuba. . . .\n\nThe report termed the request for coaling or naval stations \"a mutilation of the fatherland.\" It concluded:\n\nA people occupied militarily is being told that before consulting their own government, before being free in their own territory, they should grant the military occupants who came as friends and allies, rights and powers which would annul the sovereignty of these very people. That is the situation created for us by the method which the United States has just adopted. It could not be more obnoxious and inadmissible\n\nWith this report, the Convention overwhelmingly rejected the Platt Amendment.\n\nWithin the next three months, however, the pressure from the United States, the military occupation, the refusal to allow the Cubans to set up their own government until they acquiesced, had its effect; the Convention, after several refusals, adopted the Platt Amendment. General Leonard Wood wrote in 1901 to Theodore Roosevelt: \"There is, of course, little or no independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment.\"\n\nCuba was thus brought into the American sphere, but not as an outright colony. However, the Spanish-American war did lead to a number of direct annexations by the United States. Puerto Rico, a neighbor of Cuba in the Caribbean, belonging to Spain, was taken over by U.S. military forces. The Hawaiian Islands, one-third of the way across the Pacific, which had already been penetrated by American missionaries and pineapple plantation owners, and had been described by American officials as \"a ripe pear ready to be plucked,\" was annexed by joint resolution of Congress in July of 1898. Around the same time, Wake Island, 2,300 miles west of Hawaii, on the route to Japan, was occupied. And Guam, the Spanish possession in the Pacific, almost all the way to the Philippines, was taken. In December of 1898, the peace treaty was signed with Spain, officially turning over to the United States Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, for a payment of $20 million.\n\nThere was heated argument in the United States about whether or not to take the Philippines. As one story has it, President McKinley told a group of ministers visiting the White House how he came to his decision:\n\nBefore you go I would like to say just a word about the Philippine business. . . . The truth is I didn't want the Philippines, and when they came to us as a gift from the gods, I did not know what to do with them. . . . I sought counsel from all sides -- Democrats as well as Republicans -- but got little help.\n\nI thought first we would only take Manila; then Luzon, then other islands, perhaps, also.\n\nI walked the floor of the White House night after night until midnight; and I am not ashamed to tell you, gentlemen, that I went down on my knees and prayed Almighty God for light and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came to me this way -- I don't know how it was, but it came:\n\n1) That we could not give them back to Spain -- that would be cowardly and dishonorable.\n\n2) That we could not turn them over to France or Germany, our commercial rivals in the Orient -- that would be bad business and discreditable.\n\n3) That we could not leave them to themselves -- they were unfit for self-government -- and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than Spain's was; and\n\n4) That there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow men for whom Christ also died. And then I went to bed and went to sleep and slept soundly.\n\nThe Filipinos did not get the same message from God. In February 1899, they rose in revolt against American rule, as they had rebelled several times against the Spanish. Emilio Aguinaldo, a Filipino leader, who had earlier been brought back from China by U.S. warships to lead soldiers against Spain, now became leader of the insurrectos fighting the United States. He proposed Filipino independence within a U.S. protectorate, but this was rejected.\n\nIt took the United States three years to crush the rebellion, using seventy thousand troops -- four times as many as were landed in Cuba -- and thousands of battle casualties, many times more than in Cuba. It was a harsh war. For the Filipinos the death rate was enormous from battle casualties and from disease.\n\nThe taste of empire was on the lips of politicians and business interests throughout the country now. Racism, paternalism, and talk of money mingled with talk of destiny and civilization. In the Senate, Albert Beveridge spoke, January 9, 1900, for the dominant economic and political interests of the country:\n\nMr. President, the times call for candor. The Philippines are ours forever. . . . And just beyond the Philippines are China's illimitable markets. We will not retreat from either. . . . We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of the world. . . .\n\nThe Pacific is our ocean. . . . Where shall we turn for consumers of our surplus? Geography answers the question. China is our natural customer. . . . The Philippines give us a base at the door of all the East. . . .\n\nNo land in America surpasses in fertility the plains and valleys of Luzon. Rice and coffee, sugar and cocoanuts, hemp and tobacco. . . . The wood of the Philippines can supply the furniture of the world for a century to come. At Cebu the best informed man on the island told me that 40 miles of Cebu's mountain chain are practically mountains of coal. . . .\n\nI have a nugget of pure gold picked up in its present form on the banks of a Philippine creek. . . .\n\nMy own belief is that there are not 100 men among them who comprehend what Anglo-Saxon self-government even means, and there are over 5,000,000 people to be governed.\n\nIt has been charged that our conduct of the war has been cruel. Senators, it has been the reverse. . . . Senators must remember that we are not dealing with Americans or Europeans. We are dealing with Orientals.\n\nThe fighting with the rebels began, McKinley said, when the insurgents attacked American forces. But later, American soldiers testified that the United States had fired the first shot. After the war, an army officer speaking in Boston's Faneuil Hall said his colonel had given him orders to provoke a conflict with the insurgents.\n\nIn February 1899, a banquet took place in Boston to celebrate the Senate's ratification of the peace treaty with Spain. President McKinley himself had been invited by the wealthy textile manufacturer W. B. Plunkett to speak. It was the biggest banquet in the nation's history: two thousand diners, four hundred waiters. McKinley said that \"no imperial designs lurk in the American mind,\" and at the same banquet, to the same diners, his Postmaster General, Charles Emory Smith, said that \"what we want is a market for our surplus.\"\n\nWilliam James, the Harvard philosopher, wrote a letter to the Boston Transcript about \"the cold pot grease of McKinley's can't at the recent Boston banquet\" and said the Philippine operation \"reeked of the infernal adroitness of the great department store, which has reached perfect expertness in the art of killing silently, and with no public squalling or commotion, the neighboring small concerns.\"\n\nJames was part of a movement of prominent American businessmen, politicians, and intellectuals who formed the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898 and carried on a long campaign to educate the American public about the horrors of the Philippine war and the evils of imperialism. It was an odd group (Andrew Carnegie belonged), including antilabor aristocrats and scholars, united in a common moral outrage at what was being done to the Filipinos in the name of freedom. Whatever their differences on other matters, they would all agree with William James's angry statement: \"God damn the U.S. for its vile conduct in the Philippine Isles.\"\n\nThe Anti-Imperialist League published the letters of soldiers doing duty in the Philippines. A captain from Kansas wrote: \"Caloocan was supposed to contain 17,000 inhabitants. The Twentieth Kansas swept through it, and now Caloocan contains not one living native.\" A private from the same outfit said he had \"with my own hand set fire to over fifty houses of Filipinos after the victory at Caloocan. Women and children were wounded by our fire.\"\n\nA volunteer from the state of Washington wrote: \"Our fighting blood was up, and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' . . . This shooting human beings beats rabbit hunting all to pieces.\"\n\nIt was a time of intense racism in the United States. In the years between 1889 and 1903, on the average, every week, two Negroes were lynched by mobs -- hanged, burned, mutilated. The Filipinos were brown-skinned, physically identifiable, strange-speaking and strange-looking to Americans. To the usual indiscriminate brutality of war was thus added the factor of racial hostility.\n\nIn November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger reported:\n\nThe present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog. . . . Our soldiers have pumped salt water into men to make them talk, and have taken prisoners people who held up their hands and peacefully surrendered, and an hour later, without an atom of evidence to show that they were even insurrectos, stood them on a bridge and shot them down one by one, to drop into the water below and float down, as examples to those who found their bullet-loaded corpses.\n\nEarly in 1901 an American general returning to the United States from southern Luzon, said:\n\nOne-sixth of the natives of Luzon have either been killed or have died of the dengue fever in the last few years. The loss of life by killing alone has been very great, but I think not one man has been slain except where his death has served the legitimate purposes of war. It has been necessary to adopt what in other countries would probably be thought harsh measures.\n\nSecretary of War Elihu Root responded to the charges of brutality: \"The war in the Philippines has been conducted by the American army with scrupulous regard for the rules of civilized warfare. . . . with self-restraint and with humanity never surpassed.\"\n\nIn Manila, a Marine named Littletown Waller, a major, was accused of shooting eleven defenseless Filipinos, without trial, on the island of Samar. Other marine officers described his testimony:\n\nThe major said that General Smith instructed him to kill and burn, and said that the more he killed and burned the better pleased he would be; that it was no time to take prisoners, and that he was to make Samar a howling wilderness. Major Waller asked General Smith to define the age limit for killing, and he replied \"Everything over ten.\"\n\nIn the province of Batangas, the secretary of the province estimated that of the population of 300,000, one-third had been killed by combat, famine, or disease.\n\nMark Twain commented on the Philippine war:\n\nWe have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors; furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable patriots; subjugated the remaining ten millions by Benevolent Assimilation, which is the pious new name of the musket; we have acquired property in the three hundred concubines and other slaves of our business partner, the Sultan of Sulu, and hoisted our protecting flag over that swag.\n\nAnd so, by these Providences of God -- and the phrase is the government's, not mine -- we are a World Power.\n\nAmerican firepower was overwhelmingly superior to anything the Filipino rebels could put together. In the very first battle, Admiral Dewey steamed up the Pasig River and fired 500-pound shells into the Filipino trenches. Dead Filipinos were piled so high that the Americans used their bodies for breastworks. A British witness said: \"This is not war; it is simply massacre and murderous butchery.\" He was wrong; it was war.\n\nFor the rebels to hold out against such odds for years meant that they had the support of the population. General Arthur MacArthur, commander of the Filipino war, said: \" . . . I believed that Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. I did not like to believe that the whole population of Luzon -- the native population, that is -- was opposed to us.\" But he said he was \"reluctantly compelled\" to believe this because the guerrilla tactics of the Filipino army \"depended upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population.\"\n\nDespite the growing evidence of brutality and the work of the Anti-Imperialist League, some of the trade unions in the United States supported the action in the Philippines. The Typographical Union said it liked the idea of annexing more territory because English-language schools in those areas would help the printing trade. The publication of the glassmakers saw value in new territories that would buy glass. The railroad brotherhoods saw shipment of U.S. goods to the new territories meaning more work for railroad workers. Some unions repeated what big business was saying, that territorial expansion, by creating a market for surplus goods, would prevent another depression.\n\nOn the other hand, when the Leather Workers' Journal wrote that an increase in wages at home would solve the problem of surplus by creating more purchasing power inside the country, the Carpenters' Journal asked: \"How much better off are the workingmen of England through all its colonial possessions?\" The National Labor Tribune, publication of the Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers, agreed that the Philippines were rich with resources, but added:\n\nThe same can be said of this country, but if anybody were to ask you if you owned a coal mine, a sugar plantation, or railroad you would have to say no . . . all those things are in the hands of the trusts controlled by a few. . . .\n\nWhen the treaty for annexation of the Philippines was up for debate in Congress in early 1899, the Central Labor Unions of Boston and New York opposed it. There was a mass meeting in New York against annexation. The Anti-Imperialist League circulated more than a million pieces of literature against taking the Philippines. (Foner says that while the League was organized and dominated by intellectuals and business people, a large part of its half-million members were working-class people, including women and blacks.) Locals of the League held meetings all over the country. The campaign against the Treaty was a powerful one, and when the Senate did ratify it, it was by one vote.\n\nThe mixed reactions of labor to the war -- lured by economic advantage, yet repelled by capitalist expansion and violence -- ensured that labor could not unite either to stop the war or to conduct class war against the system at home. The reactions of black soldiers to the war were also mixed: there was the simple need to get ahead in a society where opportunities for success were denied the black man, and the military life gave such possibilities. There was race pride, the need to show that blacks were as courageous, as patriotic, as anyone else. And yet, there was with all this the consciousness of a brutal war, fought against colored people, a counterpart of the violence committed against black people in the United States.\n\nWillard Gatewood, in his book Smoked Yankees and the Struggle for Empire, reproduces and analyzes 114 letters to Negro newspapers written by black soldiers in the period 1898-1902. The letters show all those conflicting emotions. Black soldiers encamped in Tampa, Florida, ran into bitter race hatred by white inhabitants there. And then, after they fought with distinction in Cuba, Negroes were not rewarded with officers' commissions; white officers commanded black regiments.\n\nNegro soldiers in Lakeland, Florida, pistol-whipped a drugstore owner when he refused to serve one of them, and then, in a confrontation with a white crowd, killed a civilian. In Tampa, a race riot began when drunken white soldiers used a Negro child as a target to show their marksmanship; Negro soldiers retaliated, and then the streets \"ran red with negro blood,\" according to press dispatches. Twenty-seven Negro soldiers and three whites were severely wounded. The chaplain of a black regiment in Tampa wrote to the Cleveland Gazette:\n\nIs America any better than Spain? Has she not subjects in her very midst who are murdered daily without a trial of judge or jury? Has she not subjects in her own borders whose children are half-fed and half-clothed, because their father's skin is black. . . . Yet the Negro is loyal to his country's flag.\n\nThe same chaplain, George Prioleau, talks of black veterans of the Cuban war \"unkindly and sneeringly received\" in Kansas City, Missouri. He says that \"these black boys, heroes of our country, were not allowed to stand at the counters of restaurants and eat a sandwich and drink a cup of coffee, while the white soldiers were welcomed and invited to sit down at the tables and eat free of cost.\"\n\nBut it was the Filipino situation that aroused many blacks in the United States to militant opposition to the war. The senior bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Henry M. Turner, called the campaign in the Philippines \"an unholy war of conquest\" and referred to the Filipinos as \"sable patriots.\"\n\nThere were four black regiments on duty in the Philippines. Many of the black soldiers established rapport with the brown-skinned natives on the islands, and were angered by the term \"nigger\" used by white troops to describe the Filipinos. An \"unusually large number\" of black troops deserted during the Philippines campaign, Gatewood says. The Filipino rebels often addressed themselves to \"The Colored American Soldier\" in posters, reminding them of lynchings back home, asking them not to serve the white imperialist against other colored people.\n\nSome deserters joined the Filipino rebels. The most famous of these was David Fagan of the 24th Infantry. According to Gatewood: \"He accepted a commission in the insurgent army and for two years wreaked havoc upon the American forces.\"\n\nFrom the Philippines, William Simms wrote:\n\nI was struck by a question a little Filipino boy asked me, which ran about this way: \"Why does the American Negro come . . . to fight us where we are much a friend to him and have not done anything to him. He is all the same as me and me all the same as you. Why don't you fight those people in America who burn Negroes, that make a beast of you . . .\"?\n\nAnother soldier's letter of 1899:\n\nOur racial sympathies would naturally be with the Filipinos. They are fighting manfully for what they conceive to be their best interests. But we cannot for the sake of sentiment turn our back upon our own country.\n\nPatrick Mason, a sergeant in the 24th Infantry, wrote to the Cleveland Gazette, which had taken a strong stand against annexation of the Philippines:\n\nDear Sir: I have not had any fighting to do since I have been here and don't care to do any. I feel sorry for these people and all that have come under the control of the United States. I don't believe they will be justly dealt by. The first thing in the morning is the \"Nigger\" and the last thing at night is the \"Nigger.\" . . . You are right in your opinions. I must not say much as I am a soldier. . . .\n\nA black infantryman named William Fulbright wrote from Manila in June 1901 to the editor of a paper in Indianapolis: \"This struggle on the islands has been naught but a gigantic scheme of robbery and oppression.\"\n\nBack home, while the war against the Filipinos was going on, a group of Massachusetts Negroes addressed a message to President McKinley:\n\nWe the colored people of Massachusetts in mass meeting assembled . . . have resolved to address ourselves to you in an open letter, notwithstanding your extraordinary, your incomprehensible silence on the subject of our wrongs. . . .\n\n. . . you have seen our sufferings, witnessed from your high place our awful wrongs and miseries, and yet you have at no time and on no occasion opened your lips on our behalf. . . .\n\nWith one accord, with an anxiety that wrenched our hearts with cruel hopes and fears, the Colored people of the United States turned to you when Wilmington, North Carolina was held for two dreadful days and nights in the clutch of a bloody revolution; when Negroes, guilty of no crime except the color of their skin and a desire to exercise the rights of their American citizenship, were butchered like dogs in the streets of that ill-fated town . . . for want of federal aid, which you would not and did not furnish. . . .\n\nIt was the same thing with that terrible ebullition of mob spirit at Phoenix, South Carolina, when black men were hunted and murdered, and white men [these were white radicals in Phoenix] shot and driven out of that place by a set of white savages. . . . We looked in vain for some word or some act from you. . . .\n\nAnd when you made your Southern tour a little later, and we saw how cunningly you catered to Southern race prejudice. . . . How you preached patience, industry, moderation to your long-suffering black fellow citizens, and patriotism, jingoism and imperialism to your white ones. . . .\n\nThe \"patience, industry, and moderation\" preached to blacks, the \"patriotism\" preached to whites, did not fully sink in. In the first years of the twentieth century, despite all the demonstrated power of the state, large numbers of blacks, whites, men, women became impatient, immoderate, unpatriotic.", "http://genius.com/Howard-zinn-chapter-12-the-empire-and-the-people-annotated"], "52375": ["Poet Laureate Infinity by\u00a0Canibus", "Poet Laureate Infinity Lyrics\n\n[Vocal Layer 1]\nI got bored with four beats to the measure\nProfessor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure\nTake a closer look at the bars\nYou'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them\nStarted with a 100, the Game spit 3, I said, \"Fuck it\nI'ma have to show these niggas something\"\nToo easy, who'd believe me if I said that it wasn't?\nThe rhyme is a weapon, I bust it, the Brotherhood got me covered\nOP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars\nI drive forward, sandstorms make my eyes water\nSkull is a submarine hull\nDolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R\nThe rhymes are raw, deeper than yours\nYou crawled before you walked but didn't think about your thoughts before you talked\nWe spit for sport, I won you lost\nBut you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross\nThis is 'The Greatest Rhyme of All Time' supposedly\n1000 Bars it will probably always be\nMentally top heavy, not many can rock with me\nHip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me\nI said, \"Nobody benefits, everyone perishes\"\nI tell them this, they say, \"Here, it's time for your medicine\"\nImagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line\nWhen I inspired Hova and Nas\nI listened to '44 4's' 22 times\n'I Gave You Power', God stop my heart if I'm lying\nYou like red or white wine?

Alfred de Vigny\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reader will remember that, long before going that day (on the evening of which the Princesse de Guermantes was to give her party) to pay the Duke and Duchess the visit which I have just described, I had kept watch for their return and had made, in the course of my vigil, a discovery which, albeit concerning M. de Charlus in particular, was in itself so important that I have until now, until the moment when I could give it the prominence and treat it with the fulness that it demanded, postponed giving any account of it. I had, as I have said, left the marvellous point of vantage, so snugly contrived for me at the top of the house, commanding the broken and irregular slopes leading up to the H\u00f4tel de Br\u00e9quigny, and gaily decorated in the Italian manner by the rose-pink campanile of the Marquis de Fr\u00e9court\u2019s stables. I had felt it to be more convenient, when I thought that the Duke and Duchess were on the point of returning, to post myself on the staircase. I regretted somewhat the abandonment of my watch-tower. But at that time of day, namely the hour immediately following luncheon, I had less cause for regret, for I should not then have seen, as in the morning, the foptmen of the Br\u00e9quigny-Tresmes household, converted by distance into minute figures in a picture, make their leisurely ascent of the abrupt precipice, feather-brush in hand, behind the large, transparent flakes of mica which stood out so charmingly upon its ruddy bastions. Failing the geologist\u2019s field of contemplation, I had at least that of the botanist, and was peering through the shutters of the staircase window at the Duchess\u2019s little tree and at the precious plant, exposed in the courtyard with that insistence with which mothers \u2018bring out\u2019 their marriageable offspring, and asking myself whether the unlikely insect would come, by a providential hazard, to visit the offered and neglected pistil. My curiosity emboldening me by degrees, I went down to the ground-floor window, which also stood open with its shutters ajar. I could hear distinctly, as he got ready to go out, Jupien who could not detect me behind my blind, where I stood perfectly still until the moment when I drew quickly aside in order not to be seen by M. de Charlus, who, on his way to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis, was slowly crossing the courtyard, a pursy figure, aged by the strong light, his hair visibly grey. Nothing short of an indisposition of Mme. de Villeparisis (consequent on the illness of the Marquis de Fierbois, with whom he personally was at daggers drawn) could have made M. de Charlus pay a call, perhaps for the first time in his life, at that hour of the day. For with that eccentricity of the Guermantes, who, instead of conforming to the ways of society, used to modify them to suit their own personal habits (habits not, they thought, social, and deserving in consequence the abasement before them of that thing of no value, Society \u2014 thus it was that Mme. de Marsantes had no regular \u2018day,\u2019 but was at home to her friends every morning between ten o\u2019clock and noon), the Baron, reserving those hours for reading, hunting for old curiosities and so forth, paid calls only between four and six in the afternoon. At six o\u2019clock he went to the Jockey Club, or took a stroll in the Bois. A moment later, I again recoiled, in order not to be seen by Jupien. It was nearly time for him to start for the office, from which he would return only for dinner, and not even then always during the last week, his niece and her apprentices having gone to the country to finish a dress there for a customer. Then, realising that no one could see me, I decided not to let myself be disturbed again, for fear of missing, should the miracle be fated to occur, the arrival, almost beyond the possibility of hope (across so many obstacles of distance, of adverse risks, of dangers), of the insect sent from so far as ambassador to the virgin who had so long been waiting for him to appear. I knew that this expectancy was no more passive than in the male flower, whose stamens had spontaneously curved so that the insect might more easily receive their offering; similarly the female flower that stood here, if the insect came, would coquettishly arch her styles; and, to be more effectively penetrated by him, would imperceptibly advance, like a hypocritical but ardent damsel, to meet him half-way. The laws of the vegetable kingdom are themselves governed by other laws, increasingly exalted. If the visit of an insect, that is to say, the transportation of the seed of one flower is generally necessary for the fertilisation of another, that is because autofecundation, the fertilisation of a flower by itself, would lead, like a succession of intermarriages in the same family, to degeneracy and sterility, whereas the crossing effected by the insects gives to the subsequent generations of the same species a vigour unknown to their forebears. This invigoration may, however, prove excessive, the species develop out of all proportion; then, as an anti-toxin protects us against disease, as the thyroid gland regulates our adiposity, as defeat comes to punish pride, fatigue, indulgence, and as sleep in turn depends upon fatigue, so an exceptional act of autofecundation comes at a given point to apply its turn of the screw, its pull on the curb, brings back within normal limits the flower that has exaggerated its transgression of them. My reflexions had followed a tendency which I shall describe in due course, and I had already drawn from the visible stratagems of flowers a conclusion that bore upon a whole unconscious element of literary work, when I saw M. de Charlus coming away from the Marquise. Perhaps he had learned from his elderly relative herself, or merely from a servant, the great improvement, or rather her complete recovery from what had been nothing more than a slight indisposition. At this moment, when he did not suspect that anyone was watching him, his eyelids lowered as a screen against the sun, M. de Charlus had relaxed that tension in his face, deadened that artificial vitality, which the animation of his talk and the force of his will kept in evidence there as a rule. Pale as marble, his nose stood out firmly, his fine features no longer received from an expression deliberately assumed a different meaning which altered the beauty of their modelling; nothing more now than a Guermantes, he seemed already carved in stone, he Pala-m\u00e8de the Fifteenth, in their chapel at Combray. These general features of a whole family took on, however, in the face of M. de Charlus a fineness more spiritualised, above all more gentle. I regretted for his sake that he should habitually adulterate with so many acts of violence, offensive oddities, tale-bearings, with such harshness, susceptibility and arrogance, that he should conceal beneath a false brutality the amenity, the kindness which, at the moment of his emerging from Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, I could see displayed so innocently upon his face. Blinking his eyes in the sunlight, he seemed almost to be smiling, I found in his face seen thus in repose and, so to speak, in its natural state something so affectionate, so disarmed, that I could not help thinking how angry M. de Charlus would have been could he have known that he was being watched; for what was suggested to me by the sight of this man who was so insistent, who prided himself so upon his virility, to whom all other men seemed odiously effeminate, what he made me suddenly think of, so far had he momentarily assumed her features, expression, smile, was a woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was about to change my position again, so that he should not catch sight of me; I had neither the time nor the need to do so. What did I see? Face to face, in that courtyard where certainly they had never met before (M. de Charlus coming to the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes only in the afternoon, during the time when Jupien was at his office), the Baron, having suddenly opened wide his half-shut eyes, was studying with unusual attention the ex-tailor poised on the threshold of his shop, while the latter, fastened suddenly to the ground before M. de Charlus, taking root in it like a plant, was contemplating with a look of amazement the plump form of the middle-aged Baron. But, more astounding still, M. de Charlus\u2019s attitude having changed, Jupien\u2019s, as though in obedience to the laws of an occult art, at once brought itself into harmony with it. The Baron, who was now seeking to conceal the impression that had been made on him, and yet, in spite of his affectation of indifference, seemed unable to move away without regret, went, came, looked vaguely into the distance in the way which, he felt, most enhanced the beauty of his eyes, assumed a complacent, careless, fatuous air. Meanwhile Jupien, shedding at once the humble, honest expression which I had always associated with him, had \u2014 in perfect symmetry with the Baron \u2014 thrown up his head, given a becoming tilt to his body, placed his hand with a grotesque impertinence on his hip, stuck out his behind, posed himself with the coquetry that the orchid might have adopted on the providential arrival of the bee. I had not supposed that he could appear so repellent. But I was equally unaware that he was capable of improvising his part in this sort of dumb charade, which (albeit he found himself for the first time in the presence of M. de Charlus) seemed to have been long and carefully rehearsed; one does not arrive spontaneously at that pitch of perfection except when one meets in a foreign country a compatriot with whom an understanding then grows up of itself, both parties speaking the same language, even though they have never seen one another before\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This scene was not, however, positively comic, it was stamped with a strangeness, or if you like a naturalness, the beauty of which steadily increased. M. de Charlus might indeed assume a detached air, indifferently let his eyelids droop; every now and then he raised them, and at such moments turned on Jupien an attentive gaze. But (doubtless because he felt that such a scene could not be prolonged indefinitely in this place, whether for reasons which we shall learn later on, or possibly from that feeling of the brevity of all things which makes us determine that every blow must strike home, and renders so moving the spectacle of every kind of love), each time that M. de Charlus looked at Jupien, he took care that his glance should be accompanied by a spoken word, which made it infinitely unlike the glances we usually direct at a person whom we do or do not know; he stared at Jupien with the peculiar fixity of the person who is about to say to us: \u201cExcuse my taking the liberty, but you have a long white thread hanging down your back,\u201d or else: \u201cSurely I can\u2019t be mistaken, you come from Zurich too; I\u2019m certain I must have seen you there often in the curiosity shop.\u201d Thus, every other minute, the same question seemed to be being intensely put to Jupien in the stare of M. de Charlus, like those questioning phrases of Beethoven indefinitely repeated at regular intervals, and intended \u2014 with an exaggerated lavish-ness of preparation \u2014 to introduce a new theme, a change of tone, a \u2018reentry.\u2019 On the other hand, the beauty of the reciprocal glances of M. de Charlus and Jupien arose precisely from the fact that they did not, for the moment at least, seem to be intended to lead to anything further. This beauty, it was the first time that I had seen the Baron and Jupien display it. In the eyes of both of them, it was the sky not of Zurich but of some Oriental city, the name of which I had not yet divined, that I saw reflected. Whatever the point might be that held M. de Charlus and the ex-tailor thus arrested, their pact seemed concluded and these superfluous glances to be but ritual preliminaries, like the parties that people give before a marriage which has been definitely \u2018arranged.\u2019 Nearer still to nature \u2014 and the multiplicity of these analogies is itself all the more natural in that the same man, if we examine him for a few minutes, appears in turn as a man, a man-bird or man-insect, and so forth \u2014 one would have called them a pair of birds, the male and the female, the male seeking to make advances, the female \u2014 Jupien \u2014 no longer giving any sign of response to these overtures, but regarding her new friend without surprise, with an inattentive fixity of gaze, which she doubtless felt to be more disturbing and the only effective method, once the male had taken the first steps, and had fallen back upon preening his feathers. At length Jupien\u2019s indifference seemed to suffice him no longer; from this certainty of having conquered, to making himself be pursued and desired was but the next stage, and Jupien, deciding to go off to his work, passed through the carriage gate. It was only, however, after turning his head two or three times that he escaped into the street towards which the Baron, trembling lest he should lose the trail (boldly humming a tune, not forgetting to fling a \u2018Good day\u2019 to the porter, who, half-tipsy himself and engaged in treating a few friends in his back kitchen, did not even hear him), hurried briskly to overtake him. At the same instant, just as M. de Charlus disappeared through the gate humming like a great bumble-bee, another, a real bee this time, came into the courtyard. For all I knew this might be the one so long awaited by the orchid, which was coming to bring it that rare pollen without which it must die a virgin. But I was distracted from following the gyrations of the insect for, a few minutes later, engaging my attention afresh, Jupien (perhaps to pick up a parcel which he did take away with him eventually and so, presumably, in the emotion aroused by the apparition of M. de Charlus, had forgotten, perhaps simply for a more natural reason) returned, followed by the Baron. The latter, deciding to cut short the preliminaries, asked the tailor for a light, but at once observed: \u201cI ask you for a light, but I find that I have left my cigars at home.\u201d The laws of hospitality prevailed over those of coquetry. \u201cCome inside, you shall have everything you require,\u201d said the tailor, on whose features disdain now gave place to joy. The door of the shop closed behind them and I could hear no more. I had lost sight of the bee. I did not know whether he was the insect that the orchid needed, but I had no longer any doubt, in the case of an extremely rare insect and a captive flower, of the miraculous possibility of their conjunction when M. de Charlus (this is simply a comparison of providential hazards, whatever they may be, without the slightest scientific claim to establish a relation between certain laws and what is sometimes, most ineptly, termed homosexuality), who for years past had never come to the house except at hours when Jupien was not there, by the mere accident of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s illness had encountered the tailor, and with him the good fortune reserved for men of the type of the Baron by one of those fellow-creatures who may indeed be, as we shall see, infinitely younger than Jupien and better looking, the man predestined to exist in order that they may have their share of sensual pleasure on this earth; the man who cares only for elderly gentlemen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that I have just said, however, I was not to understand until several minutes had elapsed; so much is reality encumbered by those properties of invisibility until a chance occurrence has divested it of them. Anyhow, for the moment I was greatly annoyed at not being able to hear any more of the conversation between the ex-tailor and the Baron. I then bethought myself of the vacant shop, separated from Jupien\u2019s only by a partition that was extremely slender. I had, in order to get to it, merely to go up to our flat, pass through the kitchen, go down by the service stair to the cellars, make my way through them across the breadth of the courtyard above, and on coming to the right place underground, where the joiner had, a few months ago, still been storing his timber and where Jupien intended to keep his coal, climb the flight of steps which led to the interior of the shop. Thus the whole of my journey would be made under cover, I should not be seen by anyone. This was the most prudent method. It was not the one that I adopted, but, keeping close to the walls, I made a circuit in the open air of the courtyard, trying not to let myself be seen. If I was not, I owe it more, I am sure, to chance than to my own sagacity. And for the fact that I took so imprudent a course, when the way through the cellar was so safe, I can see three possible reasons, assuming that I had any reason at all. First of all, my impatience. Secondly, perhaps, a dim memory of the scene at Montjouvain, when I stood concealed outside Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s window. Certainly, the affairs of this sort of which I have been a spectator have always been presented in a setting of the most imprudent and least probable character, as if such revelations were to be the reward of an action full of risk, though in part clandestine. Lastly, I hardly dare, so childish does it appear, to confess the third reason, which was, I am quite sure, unconsciously decisive. Since, in order to follow \u2014 and see controverted \u2014 the military principles enunciated by Saint-Loup, I had followed in close detail the course of the Boer war, I had been led on from that to read again old accounts of explorations, narratives of travel. These stories had excited me, and I applied them to the events of my daily life to stimulate my courage. When attacks of illness had compelled me to remain for several days and nights on end not only without sleep but without lying down, without tasting food or drink, at the moment when my pain and exhaustion became so intense that I felt that I should never escape from them, I would think of some traveller cast on the beach, poisoned by noxious herbs, shivering with fever in clothes drenched by the salt water, who nevertheless in a day or two felt stronger, rose and went blindly upon his way, in search of possible inhabitants who might, when he came to them, prove cannibals. His example acted on me as a tonic, restored my hope, and I felt ashamed of my momentary discouragement. Thinking of the Boers who, with British armies facing them, were not afraid to expose themselves at the moment when they had to cross, in order to reach a covered position, a tract of open country: \u201cIt would be a fine thing,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cif I were to shew less courage when the theatre of operations is simply the human heart, and when the only steel that I, who engaged in more than one duel without fear at the time of the Dreyfus case, have to fear is that of the eyes of the neighbours who have other things to do besides looking into the courtyard,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when I was inside the shop, taking care not to let any plank in the floor make the slightest creak, as I found that the least sound in Jupien\u2019s shop could be heard from the other, I thought to myself how rash Jupien and M. de Charlus had been, and how wonderfully fortune had favoured them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not dare move. The Guermantes groom, taking advantage no doubt of his master\u2019s absence, had, as it happened, transferred to the shop in which I now stood a ladder which hitherto had been kept in the coach-house, and if I had climbed this I could have opened the ventilator above and heard as well as if I had been in Jupien\u2019s shop itself. But I was afraid of making a noise. Besides, it was unnecessary. I had not even cause to regret my not having arrived in the shop until several minutes had elapsed. For from what I heard at first in Jupien\u2019s shop, which was only a series of inarticulate sounds, I imagine that few words had been exchanged. It is true that these sounds were so violent that, if one set had not always been taken up an octave higher by a parallel plaint, I might have thought that one person was strangling another within a few feet of me, and that subsequently the murderer and his resuscitated victim were taking a bath to wash away the traces of the crime. I concluded from this later on that there is another thing as vociferous as pain, namely pleasure, especially when there is added to it \u2014 failing the fear of an eventual parturition, which could not be present in this case, despite the hardly convincing example in the Golden Legend \u2014 an immediate afterthought of cleanliness. Finally, after about half an hour (during which time I had climbed on tip-toe up my ladder so as to peep through the ventilator which I did not open), a conversation began. Jupien refused with insistence the money that M. de Charlus was pressing upon him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you have your chin shaved like that,\u201d he inquired of the Baron in a cajoling tone. \u201cIt\u2019s so becoming, a nice beard.\u201d \u201cUgh! It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d the Baron replied. Meanwhile he still lingered upon the threshold and plied Jupien with questions about the neighbourhood. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about the man who sells chestnuts at the corner, not the one on the left, he\u2019s a horror, but the other way, a great, dark fellow? And the chemist opposite, he has a charming cyclist who delivers his parcels.\u201d These questions must have ruffled Jupien, for, drawing himself up with the scorn of a great courtesan who has been forsaken, he replied: \u201cI can see you are completely heartless.\u201d Uttered in a pained, frigid, affected tone, this reproach must have made its sting felt by M. de Charlus, who, to counteract the bad impression made by his curiosity, addressed to Jupien, in too low a tone for me to be able to make out his words, a request the granting of which would doubtless necessitate their prolonging-their sojourn in the shop, and which moved the tailor sufficiently to make-him forget his annoyance, for he studied the Baron\u2019s face, plump and flushed beneath his grey hair, with the supremely blissful air of a person whose self-esteem has just been profoundly flattered, and, deciding to grant M. de Charlus the favour that he had just asked of him, after various remarks lacking in refinement such as: \u201cAren\u2019t you naughty!\u201d said to the Baron with a smiling, emotional, superior and grateful air: \u201cAll right, you big baby, come along!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf I hark back to the question of the tram conductor,\u201d M. de Charlus went on imperturbably, \u201cit is because, apart from anything else, he might offer me some entertainment on my homeward journey. For it falls to my lot, now and then, like the Caliph who used to roam the streets of Bagdad in the guise of a common merchant, to condescend to follow some curious little person whose profile may have taken my fancy.\u201d I made at this point the same observation that I had made on Bergotte. If he should ever have to plead before a bench, he would employ not the sentences calculated to convince his judges, but such Bergottesque sentences as his peculiar literary temperament suggested to him and made him find pleasure in using. Similarly M. de Charlus, in conversing with the tailor, made use of the same language that he would have used to fashionable people of his own set, even exaggerating its eccentricities, whether because the shyness which he was striving to overcome drove him to an excess of pride or, by preventing him from mastering himself (for we are always less at our ease in the company of some one who is not of our station), forced him to unveil, to lay bare his true nature, which was, in fact, arrogant and a trifle mad, as Mme. de Guermantes had remarked. \u201cSo as not to lose the trail,\u201d he went on, \u201cI spring like a little usher, like a young and good-looking doctor, into the same car as the little person herself, of whom we speak in the feminine gender only so as to conform with the rules of grammar (as we say, in speaking of a Prince, \u2018Is His Highness enjoying her usual health\u2019). If she changes her car, I take, with possibly the germs of the plague, that incredible thing called a \u2018transfer,\u2019 a number, and one which, albeit it is presented to me, is not always number one! I change \u2018carriages\u2019 in this way as many as three or four times, I end up sometimes at eleven o\u2019clock at night at the Orleans station and have to come home. Still, if it were only the Orleans station! Once, I must tell you, not having managed to get into conversation sooner, I went all the way to Orleans itself, in one of those frightful compartments where one has, to rest one\u2019s eyes upon, between triangles of what is known as \u2018string-work,\u2019 photographs of the principal architectural features of the line. There was only one vacant seat; I had in front of me, as an historic edifice, a \u2018view\u2019 of the Cathedral of Orleans, quite the ugliest in France, and as tiring a thing to have to stare at in that way against my will as if somebody had forced me to focus its towers in the lens of one of those optical penholders which give one ophthalmia. I got out of the train at Les Aubrais together with my young person, for whom alas his family (when I had imagined him to possess every defect except that of having a family) were waiting on the platform! My sole consolation, as I waited for a train to take me back to Paris, was the house of Diane de Poitiers. She may indeed have charmed one of my royal ancestors, I should have preferred a more living beauty. That is why, as an antidote to the boredom of returning home by myself, I should rather like to make friends with a sleeping-car attendant or the conductor of an omnibus. Now, don\u2019t be shocked,\u201d the Baron wound up, \u201cit is all a question of class. With what you call \u2018young gentlemen,\u2019 for instance, I feel no desire actually to have them, but I am never satisfied until I have touched them, I don\u2019t mean physically, but touched a responsive chord. As soon as, instead of leaving my letters unanswered, a young man starts writing to me incessantly, when he is morally at my disposal, I grow calm again, or at least I should grow calm were I not immediately caught by the attraction of another. Rather curious, ain\u2019t it? \u2014 Speaking of \u2018young gentlemen,\u2019 those that come to the house here, do you know any of them?\u201d \u201cNo, baby. Oh, yes, I do, a dark one, very tall, with an eye-. glass, who keeps smiling and turning round.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019 you mean.\u201d Jupien filled in the portrait, but M. de Charlus could not succeed in identifying its subject, not knowing that the ex-tailor was one of those persons, more common than is generally supposed, who never remember the colour of the hair of people they do not know well. But to me, who was aware of this infirmity in Jupien and substituted \u2018fair\u2019 for \u2018dark,\u2019 the portrait appeared to be an exact description of the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault. \u201cTo return to young men not of the lower orders,\u201d the Baron went on, \u201cat the present moment my head has been turned by a strange little fellow, an intelligent little cit who shews with regard to myself a prodigious want of civility. He has absolutely no idea of the prodigious personage that I am, and of the microscopic animalcule that he is in comparison. After all, what does it matter, the little ass may bray his head off before my august bishop\u2019s mantle.\u201d \u201cBishop!\u201d cried Jupien, who had understood nothing of M. de Charlus\u2019s concluding remarks, but was completely taken aback by the word bishop. \u201cBut that sort of thing doesn\u2019t go with religion,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three Popes in my family,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, \u201cand enjoy the right to mantle in gules by virtue of a cardinalatial title, the niece of the Cardinal, my great-uncle, having conveyed to my grandfather the title of Duke which was substituted for it. I see, though, that metaphor leaves you deaf and French history cold. Besides,\u201d he added, less perhaps by way of conclusion than as a warning, \u201cthis attraction that I feel towards the young people who avoid me, from fear of course, for only their natural respect stops their mouths from crying out to me that they love me, requires in them an outstanding social position. And again, their feint of indifference may produce, in spite of that, the directly opposite effect. Fatuously prolonged, it sickens me. To take an example from a class with which you are more familiar, when they were doing up my H\u00f4tel, so as not to create jealousies among all the duchesses who were vying with one another for the honour of being able to say that they had given me a lodging, I went for a few days to an \u2018hotel,\u2019 as they call inns nowadays. One of the bedroom valets I knew, I pointed out to him an interesting little page who used to open and shut the front door, and who remained refractory to my proposals. Finally, losing my temper, in order to prove to him that my intentions were pure, I made him an offer of a ridiculously high sum simply to come upstairs and talk to me for five minutes in my room. I waited for him in vain. I then took such a dislike to him that I used to go out by the service door so as not to see his villainous little mug at the other. I learned afterwards that he had never had any of my notes, which had been intercepted, the first by the bedroom valet, who was jealous, the next by the day porter, who was virtuous, the third by the night porter, who was in love with the little page, and used to couch with him at the hour when Dian rose. But my disgust persisted none the less, and were they to bring me the page, simply like a dish of venison on a silver platter, I should thrust him away with a retching stomach. But there\u2019s the unfortunate part of it, we have spoken of serious matters, and now all is over between us, there can be no more question of what I hoped to secure. But you could render me great services, act as my agent; why no, the mere thought of such a thing restores my vigour, and I can see that all is by no means over.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the beginning of this scene a revolution, in my unsealed eyes, had occurred in M. de Charlus, as complete, as immediate as if he had been touched by a magician\u2019s wand. Until then, because I had not understood, I had not seen. The vice (we use the word for convenience only), the vice of each of us accompanies him through life after the manner of the familiar genius who was invisible to men so long as they were unaware of his presence. Our goodness, our meanness, our name, our social relations do not disclose themselves to the eye, we carry them hidden within us. Even Ulysses did not at once recognise Athena. But the gods are immediately perceptible to one another, as quickly like to like, and so too had M. de Charlus been to Jupien. Until that moment I had been, in the presence of M. de Charlus, in the position of an absent-minded man who, standing before a pregnant woman whose distended outline he has failed to remark, persists, while she smilingly reiterates: \u201cYes, I am a little tired just now,\u201d in asking her indiscreetly: \u201cWhy, what is the matter with you?\u201d But let some one say to him: \u201cShe is expecting a child,\u201d suddenly he catches sight of her abdomen and ceases to see anything else. It is the explanation that opens our eyes; the dispelling of an error gives us an additional sense\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those of my readers who do not care to refer, for examples of this law, to the Messieurs de Charlus of their acquaintance, whom for long years they had never suspected, until the day when, upon the smooth surface of the individual just like everyone else, there suddenly appeared, traced in an ink hitherto invisible, the characters that compose the word dear to the ancient Greeks, have only, in order to convince themselves that the world which surrounds them appears to them at first naked, bare of a thousand ornaments which it offers to the eyes of others better informed, to remind themselves how many times in the course of their lives they have found themselves on the point of making a blunder. Nothing upon the blank, undocumented face of this man or that could have led them to suppose that he was precisely the brother, or the intended husband, or the lover of a woman of whom they were just going to remark: \u201cWhat a cow!\u201d But then, fortunately, a word whispered to them by some one standing near arrests the fatal expression on their lips. At once there appear, like a Men\u00e9, Tekel, Upharsin, the words: \u201cHe is engaged to,\u201d or, \u201che is the brother of,\u201d or \u201che is the lover of the woman whom we ought not to describe, in his hearing, as a cow.\u201d And this one new conception will bring about an entire regrouping, thrusting some back, others forward, of the fractional conceptions, henceforward a complete whole, which we possessed of the rest of the family. In M. de Charlus another creature might indeed have coupled itself with him which made him as different from other men as the horse makes the centaur, this creature might indeed have incorporated itself in the Baron, I had never caught a glimpse of it. Now the abstraction had become materialised, the creature at last discerned had lost its power of remaining invisible, and the transformation of M. de Charlus into a new person was so complete that not only the contrasts of his face, of his voice, but, in retrospect, the very ups and downs of his relations with myself, everything that hitherto had seemed to my mind incoherent, became intelligible, brought itself into evidence, just as a sentence which presents no meaning so long as it remains broken up in letters scattered at random upon a table, expresses, if these letters be rearranged in the proper order, a thought which one can never afterwards forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I now understood, moreover, how, earlier in the day, when I had seen him coming away from Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, I had managed to arrive at the conclusion that M. de Charlus looked like a woman: he was one! He belonged to that race of beings, less paradoxical than they appear, whose ideal is manly simply because their temperament is feminine and who in their life resemble in appearance only the rest of men; there where each of us carries, inscribed in those eyes through which he beholds everything in the universe, a human outline engraved on the surface of the pupil, for them it is that not of a nymph but of a youth. Race upon which a curse weighs and which must live amid falsehood and perjury, because it knows the world to regard as a punishable and a scandalous, as an inadmissible thing, its desire, that which constitutes for every human creature the greatest happiness in life; which must deny its God, since even Christians, when at the bar of justice they appear and are arraigned, must before Christ and in His Name defend themselves, as from a calumny, from the charge of what to them is life itself; sons without a mother, to whom they are obliged to lie all her life long and even in the hour when they close her dying eyes; friends without friendships, despite all those which their charm, frequently recognised, inspires and their hearts, often generous, would gladly feel; but can we describe as friendship those relations which flourish only by virtue of a lie and from which the first outburst of confidence and sincerity in which they might be tempted to indulge would make them be expelled with disgust, unless they are dealing with an impartial, that is to say a sympathetic mind, which however in that case, misled with regard to them by a conventional psychology, will suppose to spring from the vice confessed the very affection that is most alien to it, just as certain judges assume and are more inclined to pardon murder in inverts and treason in Jews for reasons derived from original sin and racial predestination. And lastly \u2014 according at least to the first-\u00bb theory which I sketched in outline at the time and which we shall see subjected to some modification in the sequel, a theory by which this would have angered them above all things, had not the paradox been hidden from their eyes by the very illusion that made them see and live \u2014 lovers from whom is always precluded the possibility of that love the hope of which gives them the strength to endure so many risks and so much loneliness, since they fall in love with precisely that type of man who has nothing feminine about him, who is not an invert and consequently cannot love them in return; with the result that their desire would be for ever insatiable did not their money procure for them real men, and their imagination end by making them take for real men the inverts to whom they had prostituted themselves. Their honour precarious, their liberty provisional, lasting only until the discovery of their crime; their position unstable, like that of the poet who one day was feasted at every table, applauded in every theatre in London, and on the next was driven from every lodging, unable to find a pillow upon which to lay his head, turning the mill like Samson and saying like him: \u201cThe two sexes shall die, each in a place apart!\u201d; excluded even, save on the days of general disaster when the majority rally round the victim as the Jews rallied round Dreyfus, from the sympathy \u2014 at times from the society \u2014 of their fellows, in whom they inspire only disgust at seeing themselves as they are, portrayed in a mirror which, ceasing to flatter them, accentuates every blemish that they have refused to observe in themselves, and makes them understand that what they have been calling their love (a thing to which, playing upon the word, they have by association annexed all that poetry, painting, music, chivalry, asceticism have contrived to add to love) springs not from an ideal of beauty which they have chosen but from an incurable malady; like the Jews again (save some who will associate only with others of their race and have always on their lips ritual words and consecrated pleasantries), shunning one another, seeking out those who are most directly their opposite, who do not desire their company, pardoning their rebuffs, moved to ecstasy by their condescension; but also brought into the company of their own kind by the ostracism that strikes them, the opprobrium under which they have fallen, having finally been invested, by a persecution similar to that of Israel, with the physical and moral characteristics of a race, sometimes beautiful, often hideous, finding (in spite of all the mockery with which he who, more closely blended with, better assimilated to the opposing race, is relatively, in appearance, the least inverted, heaps upon him who has remained more so) a relief in frequenting the society of their kind, and even some corroboration of their own life, so much so that, while steadfastly denying that they are a race (the name of which is the vilest of insults), those who succeed in concealing the fact that they belong to it they readily unmask, with a view less to injuring them, though they have no scruple about that, than to excusing themselves; and, going in search (as a doctor seeks cases of appendicitis) of cases of inversion in history, taking pleasure in recalling that Socrates was one of themselves, as the Israelites claim that Jesus was one of them, without reflecting that there were no abnormals when homosexuality was the norm, no anti-Christians before Christ, that the disgrace alone makes the crime because it has allowed to survive only those who remained obdurate to every warning, to every example, to every punishment, by virtue of an innate disposition so peculiar that it is more repugnant to other men (even though it may be accompanied by exalted moral qualities) than certain other vices which exclude those qualities, such as theft, cruelty, breach of faith, vices better understood and so more readily excused by the generality of men; forming a freemasonry far more extensive, more powerful and less suspected than that of the Lodges, for it rests upon an identity of tastes, needs, habits, dangers, apprenticeship, knowledge, traffic, glossary, and one in which the members themselves, who intend not to know one another, recognise one another immediately by natural or conventional, involuntary or deliberate signs which indicate one of his congeners to the beggar in the street, in the great nobleman whose carriage door he is shutting, to the father in the suitor for his daughter\u2019s hand, to him who has sought healing, absolution, defence, in the doctor, the priest, the barrister to whom he has had recourse; all of them obliged to protect their own secret but having their part in a secret shared with the others, which the rest of humanity does not suspect and which means that to them the most wildly improbable tales of adventure seem true, for in this romantic, anachronistic life the ambassador is a bosom friend of the felon, the prince, with a certain independence of action with which his aristocratic breeding has furnished him, and which the trembling little cit would lack, on leaving the duchess\u2019s party goes off to confer in private with the hooligan; a reprobate part of the human whole, but an important part, suspected where it does not exist, flaunting itself, insolent and unpunished, where its existence is never guessed; numbering its adherents everywhere, among the people, in the army, in the church, in the prison, on the throne; living, in short, at least to a great extent, in a playful and perilous intimacy with the men of the other race, provoking them, playing with them by speaking of its vice as of something alien to it; a game that is rendered easy by the blindness or duplicity of the others, a game that may be kept up for years until the day of the scandal, on which these lion-tamers are devoured; until then, obliged to make a secret of their lives, to turn away their eyes from the things on which they would naturally fasten them, to fasten them upon those from which they would naturally turn away, to change the gender of many of the words in their vocabulary, a social constraint, slight in comparison with the inward constraint which their vice, or what is improperly so called, imposes upon them with regard not so much now to others as to themselves, and in such a way that to themselves it does not appear a vice. But certain among them, more practical, busier men who have not the time to go and drive their own bargains, or to dispense with the simplification of life and that saving of time which may result from cooperation, have formed two societies of which the second is composed exclusively of persons similar to themselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is noticeable in those who are poor and have come up from the country, without friends, with nothing but their ambition to be some day a celebrated doctor or barrister, with a mind still barren of opinions, a person unadorned with manners, which they intend, as soon as possible, to decorate, just as they would buy furniture for their little attic in the Latin quarter, copying whatever they had observed in those who had already \u2018arrived\u2019 in the useful and serious profession in which they also intend to establish themselves and to become famous; in these their special taste, unconsciously inherited like a weakness for drawing, for music, a weakness of vision, is perhaps the only living and despotic originality \u2014 which on certain evenings compels them to miss some meeting, advantageous to their career, with people whose ways, in other respect, of speaking, thinking, dressing, parting their hair, they have adopted. In their quarter, where otherwise they mix only with their brother students, their teachers or some fellow-provincial who has succeeded and can help them on, they have speedily discovered other young men whom the same peculiar taste attracts to them, as in a small town one sees an intimacy grow up between the assistant master and the lawyer, who are both interested in chamber music or mediaeval ivories; applying to the object of their distraction the same utilitarian instinct, the same professional spirit which guides them in their career, they meet these young men at gatherings to which no profane outsider is admitted any more than to those that bring together collectors of old snuff-boxes, Japanese prints or rare flowers, and at which, what with the pleasure of gaining information, the practical value of making exchanges and the fear of competition, there prevail simultaneously, as in a saleroom of postage stamps, the close cooperation of the specialists and the fierce rivalries of the collectors. No one moreover in the caf\u00e9 where they have their table knows what the gathering is, whether it is that of an angling club, of an editorial staff, or of the \u2018Sons of the Indre,\u2019 so correct is their attire, so cold and reserved their manner, so modestly do they refrain from anything more than the most covert glances at the young men of fashion, the young \u2018lions\u2019 who, a few feet away, are making a great clamour about their mistresses, and among whom those who are admiring them without venturing to raise their eyes will learn only twenty years later, when they themselves are on the eve of admission to the Academy, and the others are middle-aged gentlemen in club windows, that the most seductive among them, now a stout and grizzled Charlus, was in reality akin to themselves, but differently, in another world, beneath other external symbols, with foreign labels, the strangeness of which led them into error. But these groups are at varying stages of advancement; and, just as the \u2018Union of the Left\u2019 differs from the \u2018Socialist Federation\u2019 or some Mendelssohnian musical club from the Schola Cantorum, on certain evenings, at another table, there are extremists who allow a bracelet to slip down from beneath a cuff, sometimes a necklace to gleam in the gap of a collar, who by their persistent stares, their cooings, their laughter, their mutual caresses, oblige a band of students to depart in hot haste, and are served with a civility beneath which indignation boils by a waiter who, as on the evenings when he has to serve Dreyfusards, would find pleasure in summoning the police did he not find profit in pocketing their gratuities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is with these professional organisations that the mind contrasts the taste of the solitaries, and in one respect without straining the points of difference, since it is doing no more than copy the solitaries themselves who imagine that nothing differs more widely from organised vice than what appears to them to be a misunderstood love, but with some strain nevertheless, for these different classes correspond, no less than to diverse physiological types, to successive stages in a pathological or merely social evolution. And it is, in fact, very rarely that, one day or another, it is not in some such organisation that the solitaries come to merge themselves, sometimes from simple weariness, or for convenience (just as the people who have been most strongly opposed to such innovations end by having the telephone installed, inviting the I\u00e9nas to their parties, or dealing with Potin). They meet there, for that matter, with none too friendly a reception as a rule, for, in their relatively pure lives, their want of experience, the saturation in dreams to which they have been reduced, have branded more strongly upon them those special marks of effeminacy which the professionals have sought to efface. And it must be admitted that, among certain of these newcomers, the woman is not only inwardly united to the man but hideously visible, agitated as one sees them by a hysterical spasm, by a shrill laugh which convulses their knees and hands, looking no more like the common run of men than those monkeys with melancholy, shadowed eyes and prehensile feet who dress up in dinner-jackets and black bow ties; so that these new recruits are judged by others, less chaste for all that themselves, to be compromising associates, and their admission is hedged with difficulties; they are accepted, nevertheless, and they benefit then by those facilities by which commerce, great undertakings have transformed the lives of individuals, and have brought within their reach commodities hitherto too costly to acquire and indeed hard to find, which now submerge them beneath the plethora of what by themselves they had never succeeded in discovering amid the densest crowds. But, even with these innumerable outlets, the burden of social constraint is still too heavy for some, recruited principally among those who have not made a practice of self-control, and who still take to be rarer than it actually is their way of love. Let us leave out of consideration for the moment those who, the exceptional character of their inclinations making them regard themselves as superior to the other sex, look down upon women, make homosexuality the privilege of great genius and of glorious epochs of history, and, when they seek to communicate their taste to others, approach not so much those who seem to them to be predisposed towards it (as the morphino-maniac does with his morphia) as those who seem to them to be worthy of it, from apostolic zeal, just as others preach Zionism, conscientious objection to military service, Saint-Simonism, vegetarianism or anarchy. Here is one who, should we intrude upon him in the morning, still in bed, will present to our gaze an admirable female head, so general is its expression and typical of the sex as a whole; his very hair affirms this, so feminine is its ripple; unbrushed, it falls so naturally in long curls over the cheek that one marvels how the young woman, the girl, the Galatea barely awakened to life, in the unconscious mass of this male body in which she is imprisoned, has contrived so ingeniously by herself, without instruction from anyone, to make use of the narrowest apertures in her prison wall to find what was necessary to her existence. No doubt the young man who sports this delicious head does not say: \u201cI am a woman.\u201d Even if \u2014 for any of the countless possible reasons \u2014 he lives with a woman, he can deny to her that he is himself one, can swear to her that he has never had intercourse with men. But let her look at him as we have just revealed him, lying back in bed, in pyjamas, his arms bare, his throat and neck bare also beneath the darkness of his hair. The pyjama jacket becomes a woman\u2019s shift, the head that of a pretty Spanish girl. The mistress is astounded by these confidences offered to her gaze, truer than any spoken confidence could be, or indeed any action, which his actions, indeed, if they have not already done so, cannot fail later on to confirm, for every creature follows the line of his own pleasure, and if this creature is not too vicious he will seek it in a sex complementary to his own. And for the invert vice begins, not when he forms relations (for there are all sorts of reasons that may enjoin these), but when he takes his pleasure with women. The young man whom we have been attempting to portray was so evidently a woman that the women who looked upon him with longing were doomed (failing a special taste on their part) to the same disappointment as those who in Shakespeare\u2019s comedies are taken in by a girl in disguise who passes as a youth. The deception is mutual, the invert is himself aware of it, he guesses the disillusionment which, once the mask is removed, the woman will experience, and feels to what an extent this mistake as to sex is a source of poetical imaginings. Besides, even from his exacting mistress, in vain does he keep back the admission (if she, that is to say, be not herself a denizen of Gomorrah): \u201cI am a woman!\u201d when all the time with what stratagems, what agility, what obstinacy as of a climbing plant the unconscious but visible woman in him seeks the masculine organ. We have only to look at that head of curling hair on the white pillow to understand that if, in the evening, this young man slips through his guardians\u2019 fingers, in spite of anything that they, or he himself can do to restrain him, it will not be to go in pursuit of women. His mistress may chastise him, may lock him up; next day, the man-woman will have found some way of attaching himself to a man, as the convolvulus throws out its tendrils wherever it finds a convenient post or rake. Why, when we admire in the face of this person a delicacy that touches our hearts, a gracefulness, a spontaneous affability such as men do not possess, should we be dismayed to learn that this young man runs after boxers? They are different aspects of an identical reality. And indeed, what repels us is the most touching thing of all, more touching than any refinement of delicacy, for it represents an admirable though unconscious effort on the part of nature: the recognition of his sex by itself, in spite of the sexual deception, becomes apparent, the uncon-fessed attempt to escape from itself towards what an initial error on the part of society has segregated from it. Some, those no doubt who have been most timid in childhood, are scarcely concerned with the material kind of the pleasure they receive, provided that they can associate it with a masculine face. Whereas others, whose sensuality is doubtless more violent, imperiously restrict their material pleasure within certain definite limitations. These live perhaps less exclusively beneath the sway of Saturn\u2019s outrider, since for them women are not entirely barred, as for the former sort, in whose eyes women would have no existence apart from conversation, flirtation, loves not of the heart but of the head. But the second sort seek out those women who love other women; who can procure for them a young man, enhance the pleasure which they feel on finding themselves in his company; better still, they can, in the same fashion, enjoy with such women the same pleasure as with a man. Whence it arises that jealousy is kindled in those who love the first sort only by the pleasure which they may be enjoying with a man, which alone seems to their lovers a betrayal, since these do not participate in the love of women, have practised it only as a habit, and, so as to reserve for themselves the possibility of eventual marriage, representing to themselves so little the pleasure that it is capable of giving that they cannot be distressed by the thought that he whom they love is enjoying that pleasure; whereas the other sort often inspire jealousy by their love-affairs with women. For, in the relations which they have with her, they play, for the woman who loves her own sex, the part of another woman, and she offers them at the same time more or less what they find in other men, so that the jealous friend suffers from the feeling that he whom he loves is riveted to her who is to him almost a man, and at the same time feels his beloved almost escape him because, to these women, he is something which the lover himself cannot conceive, a sort of woman. We need not pause here to consider those young fools who by a sort of arrested development, to tease their friends or to shock their families, proceed with a kind of frenzy to choose clothes that resemble women\u2019s dress, to redden their lips and blacken their eyelashes; we may leave them out of account, for they are those whom we shall find later on, when they have suffered the all too cruel penalty of their affectation, spending what remains of their lifetime in vain attempts to repair by a sternly protestant demeanour the wrong that they did to themselves when they were carried away by the same demon that urges young women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain to live in a scandalous fashion, to set every convention at defiance, to scoff at the entreaties of their relatives, until the day when they set themselves with perseverance but without success to reascend the slope down which it had seemed to them that it would be so amusing to glide, down which they had found it so amusing, or rather had not been able to stop themselves from gliding. Finally, let us leave to a later volume the men who have sealed a pact with Gomorrah. We shall deal with them when M. de Charlus comes to know them. Let us leave out for the present all those, of one sort or another, who will appear each in his turn, and, to conclude this first sketch of the subject, let us say a word only of those whom we began to mention just now, the solitary class. Supposing their vice to be more exceptional than it is, they have retired into solitude from the day on which they discovered it, after having carried it within themselves for a long time without knowing it, for a longer time only than certain other men. For no one can tell at first that he is an invert or a poet or a snob or a scoundrel. The boy who has been reading erotic poetry or looking at indecent pictures, if he then presses his body against a schoolfellow\u2019s, imagines himself only to be communing with him in an identical desire for a woman. How should he suppose that he is not like everybody else when he recognises the substance of what he feels on reading Mme. de Lafayette, Racine, Baudelaire, Walter Scott, at a time when he is still too little capable of observing himself to take into account what he has added from his own store to the picture, and that if the sentiment be the same the object differs, that what he desires is Rob Roy, and not Diana Vernon? With many, by a defensive prudence on the part of the instinct that precedes the clearer vision of the intellect, the mirror and walls of their bedroom vanish beneath a cloud of coloured prints of actresses; they compose poetry such as:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I love but Chloe in the world\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Chloe is divine;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her golden hair is sweetly curled\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For her my heart doth pine\n\nMust we on that account attribute to the opening phase of such lives a taste which we shall never find in them later on, like those flaxen ringlets on the heads of children which are destined to change to the darkest brown? Who can tell whether the photographs of women are not a first sign of hypocrisy, a first sign also of horror at other inverts? But the solitary kind are precisely those to whom hypocrisy is painful. Possibly even the example of the Jews, of a different type of colony, is not strong enough to account for the frail hold that their upbringing has upon them, or for the artfulness with which they find their way back (perhaps not to anything so sheerly terrible as the suicide to which maniacs, whatever precautions one may take with them, return, and, pulled out of the river into which they have flung themselves, take poison, procure revolvers, and so forth; but) to a life of which the men of the other race not only do not understand, cannot imagine, abominate the essential pleasures but would be filled with horror by the thought of its frequent danger and everlasting shame. Perhaps, to form a picture of these, we ought to think, if not of the wild animals that never become domesticated, of the lion-cubs said to be tame but lions still at heart, then at least of the Negroes whom the comfortable existence of the white man renders desperately unhappy and who prefer the risks of a life of savagery and its incomprehensible joys. When the day has dawned on which they have discovered themselves to be incapable at once of lying to others and of lying to themselves, they go away to live in the country, shunning the society of their own kind (whom they believe to be few in number) from horror of the monstrosity or fear of the temptation, and that of the rest of humanity from shame. Never having arrived at true maturity, plunged in a constant melancholy, now and again, some Sunday evening when there is no moon, they go for a solitary walk as far as a crossroads where, although not a word has been said, there has come to meet them one of their boyhood\u2019s friends who is living in a house in the neighbourhood. And they begin again the pastimes of long ago, on the grass, in the night, neither uttering a word. During the week, they meet in their respective houses, talk of no matter what, without any allusion to what has occurred between them, exactly as though they had done nothing and were not to do anything again, save, in their relations, a trace of coldness, of irony, of irritability and rancour, at times of hatred. Then the neighbour sets out on a strenuous expedition on horseback, and, on a mule, climbs mountain peaks, sleeps in the snow; his friend, who identifies his own vice with a weakness of temperament, the cabined and timid life, realises that vice can no longer exist in his friend now emancipated, so many thousands of feet above sea-level. And, sure enough, the other takes a wife. And yet the abandoned one is not cured (in spite of the cases in which, as we shall see, inversion is curable). He insists upon going down himself every morning to the kitchen to receive the milk from the hands of the dairyman\u2019s boy, and on the evenings when desire is too strong for him will go out of his way to set a drunkard on the right road or to \u201cadjust the dress\u201d of a blind man. No doubt the life of certain inverts appears at times to change, their vice (as it is called) is no longer apparent in their habits; but nothing is ever lost; a missing jewel turns up again; when the quantity of a sick man\u2019s urine decreases, it is because he is perspiring more freely, but the excretion must invariably occur. One day this homosexual hears of the death of a young cousin, and from his inconsolable grief we learned that it was to this love, chaste possibly and aimed rather at retaining esteem than at obtaining possession, that his desires have passed by a sort of virescence, as, in a budget, without any alteration in the total, certain expenditure is carried under another head. As is the case with invalids in whom a sudden attack of urticaria makes their chronic ailments temporarily disappear, this pure love for a young relative seems, in the invert, to have momentarily replaced, by metastasis, habits that will, one day or another, return to fill the place of the vicarious, cured malady\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the married neighbour of our recluse has returned; before the beauty of the young bride and the demonstrative affection of her, husband, on the day when their friend is obliged to invite them to dinner, he feels ashamed of the past. Already in an interesting condition, she must return home early, leaving her husband behind; he, when the time has come for him to go home also, asks his host to accompany him for part of the way; at first, no suspicion enters his mind, but at the crossroads he finds himself thrown down on the grass, with not a word said, by the mountaineer who is shortly to become a father. And their meetings begin again, and continue until the day when there comes to live not far off a cousin of the young woman, with whom her husband is now constantly to be seen. And he, if the twice-abandoned friend calls in the evening and endeavours to approach him, is furious, and repulses him with indignation that the other has not had the tact to foresee the disgust which he must henceforward inspire. Once, however, there appears a stranger, sent to him by his faithless friend; but being busy at the time, the abandoned one cannot see him, and only afterwards learns with what object his visitor came\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then the solitary languishes alone. He has no other diversion than to go to the neighbouring watering-place to ask for some information or other from a certain railwayman there. But the latter has obtained promotion, has been transferred to the other end of the country; the solitary will no longer be able to go and ask him the times of the trains or the price of a first class ticket, and, before retiring to dream, Griselda-like, in his tower, loiters upon the beach, a strange Andromeda whom no Argonaut will come to free, a sterile Medusa that must perish upon the sand, or else he stands idly, until his train starts, upon the platform, casting over the crowd of passengers a gaze that will seem indifferent, contemptuous or distracted to those of another race, but, like the luminous glow with which certain insects bedeck themselves in order to attract others of their species, or like the nectar which certain flowers offer to attract the insects that will fertilise them, would not deceive the almost undiscoverable sharer of a pleasure too singular, too hard to place, which is offered him, the colleague with whom our specialist could converse in the half-forgotten tongue; in which last, at the most, some seedy loafer upon the platform will put up a show of interest, but for pecuniary gam alone, like those people who, at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, in the room in which the Professor of Sanskrit lectures without an audience, attend his course but only because the room itself is heated. Medusa! Orchid! When I followed my instinct only, the medusa used to revolt me at Balbec; but if I had the eyes to regard it, like Michelet, from the standpoint of natural history, and aesthetic, I saw an exquisite wheel of azure flame. Are they not, with the transparent velvet of their petals, as it were the mauve orchids of the sea? Like so many creatures of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, like the plant which would produce vanilla but, because in its structure the male organ is divided by a partition from the female, remains sterile unless the humming-birds or certain tiny bees convey the pollen from one to the other, or man fertilises them by artificial means, M. de Charlus (and here the word fertilise must be understood in a moral sense, since in the physical sense the union of male with male is and must be sterile, but it is no small matter that a person may encounter the sole pleasure which he is capable of enjoying, and that every \u2018creature here below\u2019 can impart to some other \u2018his music, or his fragrance or his flame\u2019), M. de Charlus was one of those men who may be called exceptional, because however many they may be, the satisfaction, so easy in others, of their sexual requirements depends upon the coincidence of too many conditions, and of conditions too difficult to ensure. For men like M. de Charlus (leaving out of account the compromises which will appear in the course of this story and which the reader may already have foreseen, enforced by the need of pleasure which resigns itself to partial acceptations), mutual love, apart from the difficulties, so great as to be almost insurmountable, which it meets in the ordinary man, adds to these others so exceptional that what is always extremely rare for everyone becomes in their case well nigh impossible, and, if there should befall them an encounter which is really fortunate, or which nature makes appear so to them, their good fortune, far more than that of the normal lover, has about it something extraordinary, selective, profoundly necessary. The feud of the Capulets and Montagues was as nothing compared with the obstacles of every sort which must have been surmounted, the special eliminations which nature has had to submit to the hazards, already far from common, which result in love, before a retired tailor, who was intending to set off soberly for his office, can stand quivering in ecstasy before a stoutish man of fifty; this Romeo and this Juliet may believe with good reason that their love is not the caprice of a moment but a true predestination, prepared by the harmonies of their temperaments, and not only by their own personal temperaments but by those of their ancestors, by their most distant strains of heredity, so much so that the fellow creature who is conjoined with them has belonged to them from before their birth, has attracted them by a force comparable to that which governs the worlds on which we passed our former lives. M. de Charlus had distracted me from looking to see whether the bee was bringing to the orchid the pollen it had so long been waiting to receive, and had no chance of receiving save by an accident so unlikely that one might call it a sort of miracle. But this was a miracle also that I had just witnessed, almost of the same order and no less marvellous. As soon as I had considered their meeting from this point of view, everything about it seemed to me instinct with beauty. The most extraordinary devices that nature has invented to compel insects to ensure the fertilisation of flowers which without their intervention could not be fertilised because the male flower is too far away from the female \u2014 or when, if it is the wind that must provide for the transportation of the pollen, she makes that pollen so much more simply detachable from the male, so much more easily arrested in its flight by the female flower, by eliminating the secretion of nectar which is no longer of any use since there is no insect to be attracted, and, that the flower may be kept free for the pollen which it needs, which can fructify only in itself, makes it secrete a liquid which renders it immune to all other pollens \u2014 seemed to me no more marvellous than the existence of the subvariety of inverts destined to guarantee the pleasures of love to the invert who is growing old: men who are attracted not by all other men, but \u2014 by a phenomenon of correspondence and harmony similar to those that precede the fertilisation of heterostyle trimorphous flowers like the lythrum salicoria \u2014 only by men considerably older than themselves. Of this subvariety Jupien had just furnished me with an example less striking however than certain others, which every collector of a human herbary, every moral botanist can observe in spite of their rarity, and which will present to the eye a delicate youth who is waiting for the advances of a robust and paunchy quinquagenarian, remaining as indifferent to those of other young men as the hermaphrodite flowers of the short-styled primula veris so long as they are fertilised only by other primu-lae veris of short style also, whereas they welcome with joy the pollen of the primula veris with the long styles. As for M. de Charlus\u2019s part in the transaction, I noticed afterwards that there were for him various kinds of conjunction, some of which, by their multiplicity, their almost invisible speed and above all the absence of contact between the two actors, recalled still more forcibly those flowers that in a garden are fertilised by the pollen of a neighbouring flower which they may never touch. There were in fact certain persons whom it was sufficient for him to make come to his house, hold for an hour or two under the domination of his talk, for his desire, quickened by some earlier encounter, to be assuaged. By a simple use of words the conjunction was effected, as simply as it can be among the infusoria. Sometimes, as had doubtless been the case with me on the evening on which I had been summoned by him after the Guermantes dinner-party, the relief was effected by a violent ejaculation which the Baron made in his visitor\u2019s face, just as certain flowers, furnished with a hidden spring, sprinkle from within the unconsciously collaborating and disconcerted insect. M. de Charlus, from vanquished turning victor, feeling himself purged of his uneasiness and calmed, would send away the visitor who had at once ceased to appear to him desirable. Finally, inasmuch as inversion itself springs from the fact that the invert is too closely akin to woman to be capable of having any effective relations with her, it comes under a higher law which ordains that so many hermaphrodite flowers shall remain unfertile, that is to say the law of the sterility of autofecundation. It is true that inverts, in their search for a male person, will often be found to put up with other inverts as effeminate as themselves. But it is enough that they do not belong to the female sex, of which they have in them an embryo which they can put to no useful purpose, such as we find in so many hermaphrodite flowers, and even in certain hermaphrodite animals, such as the snail, which cannot be fertilised by themselves, but can by other hermaphrodites. In this respect the race of inverts, who eagerly connect themselves with Oriental antiquity or the Golden Age in Greece, might be traced back farther still, to those experimental epochs in which there existed neither dioecious plants nor monosexual animals, to that initial hermaph-roditism of which certain rudiments of male organs in the anatomy of the woman and of female organs in that of the man seem still to preserve the trace. I found the pantomime, incomprehensible to me at first, of Jupien and M. de Charlus as curious as those seductive gestures addressed, Darwin tells us, to insects not only by the flowers called composite which erect the florets of their capitals so as to be seen from a greater distance, such as a certain heterostyle which turns back its stamens and bends them to open the way for the insect, or offers him an ablution, or, to take an immediate instance, the nectar-fragrance and vivid hue of the corollae that were at that moment attracting insects to our courtyard. From this day onwards M. de Charlus was to alter the time of his visits to Mme. de Villeparisis, not that he could not see Jupien elsewhere and with greater convenience, but because to him just as much as to me the afternoon sunshine and the blossoming plant were, no doubt, linked together in memory. Apart from this, he did not confine himself to recommending the Jupiens to Mme. de Villeparisis, to the Duchesse de Guermantes, to a whole brilliant list of patrons, who were all the more assiduous in their attentions to the young seamstress when they saw that the few ladies who had held out, or had merely delayed their submission, were subjected to the direst reprisals by the Baron, whether in order that they might serve as an example, or because they had aroused his wrath and had stood out against his attempted domination; he made Jupien\u2019s position more and more lucrative, until he definitely engaged him as his secretary and established him in the state in which we shall see him later on. \u201cAh, now! There is a happy man, if you like, that Jupien,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who had a tendency to minimise or exaggerate people\u2019s generosity according as it was bestowed on herself or on others. Not that, in this instance, she had any need to exaggerate, nor for that matter did she feel any jealousy, being genuinely fond of Jupien. \u201cOh, he\u2019s such a good man, the Baron,\u201d she went on, \u201csuch a well-behaved, religious, proper sort of man. If I had a daughter to marry and was one of the rich myself, I would give her to the Baron with my eyes shut.\u201d \u201cBut, Fran\u00e7oise,\u201d my mother observed gently, \u201cshe\u2019d be well supplied with husbands, that daughter of yours. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019ve already promised her to Jupien.\u201d \u201cAh! Lordy, now,\u201d replied Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cthere\u2019s another of them that would make a woman happy. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re rich or poor, it makes no difference to your nature. The Baron and Jupien, they\u2019re just the same sort of person.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, I greatly exaggerated at the time, on the strength of this first revelation, the elective character of so carefully selected a combination. Admittedly, every man of the kind of M. de Charlus is an extraordinary creature since, if he does not make concessions to the possibilities of life, he seeks out essentially the love of a man of the other race, that is to say a man who is a lover of women (and incapable consequently of loving him); in contradiction of what I had imagined in the courtyard, where I had seen Jupien turning towards M. de Charlus like the orchid making overtures to the bee, these exceptional creatures whom we commiserate are a vast crowd, as we shall see in the course of this work, for a reason which will be disclosed only at the end of it, and commiserate themselves for being too many rather than too few. For the two angels who were posted at the gates of Sodom to learn whether its inhabitants (according to Genesis) had indeed done all the things the report of which had ascended to the Eternal Throne must have been, and of this one can only be glad, exceedingly ill chosen by the Lord, Who ought not to have entrusted the task to any but a Sodomite. Such an one the excuses: \u201cFather of six children \u2014 I keep two mistresses,\u201d and so forth could never have persuaded benevolently to lower his flaming sword and to mitigate the punishment; he would have answered: \u201cYes, and your wife lives in a torment of jealousy. But even when these women have not been chosen by you from Gomorrah, you spend your nights with a watcher of flocks upon Hebron.\u201d And he would at once have made him retrace his steps to the city which the rain of fire and brimstone was to destroy. On the contrary, they allowed to escape all the shame-faced Sodomites, even if these, on catching sight of a boy, turned their heads, like Lot\u2019s wife, though without being on that account changed like her into pillars of salt. With the result that they engendered a numerous posterity with whom this gesture has continued to be habitual, like that of the dissolute women who, while apparently studying a row of shoes displayed in a shop window, turn their heads to keep track of a passing student. These descendants of the Sodomites, so numerous that we may apply to them that other verse of Genesis: \u201cIf a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered,\u201d have established themselves throughout the entire world; they have had access to every profession and pass so easily into the most exclusive clubs that, whenever a Sodomite fails to secure election, the blackballs are, for the most part, cast by other Sodomites, who are anxious to penalise sodomy, having inherited the falsehood that enabled their ancestors to escape from the accursed city. It is possible that they may return there one day. Certainly they form in every land an Oriental colony, cultured, musical, malicious, which has certain charming qualities and intolerable defects. We shall study them with greater thoroughness in the course of the following pages; but I have thought it as well to utter here a provisional warning against the lamentable error of proposing (just as people have encouraged a Zionist movement) to create a Sodomist movement and to rebuild Sodom. For, no sooner had they arrived there than the Sodomites would leave the town so as not to have the appearance of belonging to it, would take wives, keep mistresses in other cities where they would find, incidentally, every diversion that appealed to them. They would repair to Sodom only on days of supreme necessity, when their own town was empty, at those seasons when hunger drives the wolf from the woods; in other words, everything would go on very much as it does to-day in London, Berlin, Rome, Petrograd or Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, on the day in question, before paying my call on the Duchess, I did not look so far ahead, and I was distressed to find that I had, by my engrossment in the Jupien-Charlus conjunction, missed perhaps an opportunity of witnessing the fertilisation of the blossom by the bee", "http://genius.com/Marcel-proust-introduction-lyrics"], "136277": ["The House of Mirth (Chap. 1.3) by\u00a0Edith\u00a0Wharton", "The House of Mirth (Chap. 1.3) Lyrics\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bridge at Bellomont usually lasted till the small hours; and when Lily went to bed that night she had played too long for her own good.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling no desire for the self-communion which awaited her in her room, she lingered on the broad stairway, looking down into the hall below, where the last card-players were grouped about the tray of tall glasses and silver-collared decanters which the butler had just placed on a low table near the fire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hall was arcaded, with a gallery supported on columns of pale yellow marble. Tall clumps of flowering plants were grouped against a background of dark foliage in the angles of the walls. On the crimson carpet a deer-hound and two or three spaniels dozed luxuriously before the fire, and the light from the great central lantern overhead shed a brightness on the women's hair and struck sparks from their jewels as they moved.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were moments when such scenes delighted Lily, when they gratified her sense of beauty and her craving for the external finish of life; there were others when they gave a sharper edge to the meagreness of her own opportunities. This was one of the moments when the sense of contrast was uppermost, and she turned away impatiently as Mrs. George Dorset, glittering in serpentine spangles, drew Percy Gryce in her wake to a confidential nook beneath the gallery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not that Miss Bart was afraid of losing her newly-acquired hold over Mr. Gryce. Mrs. Dorset might startle or dazzle him, but she had neither the skill nor the patience to effect his capture. She was too self-engrossed to penetrate the recesses of his shyness, and besides, why should she care to give herself the trouble? At most it might amuse her to make sport of his simplicity for an evening\u2014after that he would be merely a burden to her, and knowing this, she was far too experienced to encourage him. But the mere thought of that other woman, who could take a man up and toss him aside as she willed, without having to regard him as a possible factor in her plans, filled Lily Bart with envy. She had been bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce\u2014the mere thought seemed to waken an echo of his droning voice\u2014but she could not ignore him on the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to more boredom, must be ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities, and all on the bare chance that he might ultimately decide to do her the honour of boring her for life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a hateful fate\u2014but how escape from it? What choice had she? To be herself, or a Gerty Farish. As she entered her bedroom, with its softly-shaded lights, her lace dressing-gown lying across the silken bedspread, her little embroidered slippers before the fire, a vase of carnations filling the air with perfume, and the last novels and magazines lying uncut on a table beside the reading-lamp, she had a vision of Miss Farish's cramped flat, with its cheap conveniences and hideous wall-papers. No; she was not made for mean and shabby surroundings, for the squalid compromises of poverty. Her whole being dilated in an atmosphere of luxury; it was the background she required, the only climate she could breathe in. But the luxury of others was not what she wanted. A few years ago it had sufficed her: she had taken her daily meed of pleasure without caring who provided it. Now she was beginning to chafe at the obligations it imposed, to feel herself a mere pensioner on the splendour which had once seemed to belong to her. There were even moments when she was conscious of having to pay her way.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a long time she had refused to play bridge. She knew she could not afford it, and she was afraid of acquiring so expensive a taste. She had seen the danger exemplified in more than one of her associates\u2014in young Ned Silverton, for instance, the charming fair boy now seated in abject rapture at the elbow of Mrs. Fisher, a striking divorcee with eyes and gowns as emphatic as the head-lines of her \"case.\" Lily could remember when young Silverton had stumbled into their circle, with the air of a strayed Arcadian who has published chamung [Updater's note: charming?] sonnets in his college journal. Since then he had developed a taste for Mrs. Fisher and bridge, and the latter at least had involved him in expenses from which he had been more than once rescued by harassed maiden sisters, who treasured the sonnets, and went without sugar in their tea to keep their darling afloat. Ned's case was familiar to Lily: she had seen his charming eyes\u2014which had a good deal more poetry in them than the sonnets\u2014change from surprise to amusement, and from amusement to anxiety, as he passed under the spell of the terrible god of chance; and she was afraid of discovering the same symptoms in her own case.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For in the last year she had found that her hostesses expected her to take a place at the card-table. It was one of the taxes she had to pay for their prolonged hospitality, and for the dresses and trinkets which occasionally replenished her insufficient wardrobe. And since she had played regularly the passion had grown on her. Once or twice of late she had won a large sum, and instead of keeping it against future losses, had spent it in dress or jewelry; and the desire to atone for this imprudence, combined with the increasing exhilaration of the game, drove her to risk higher stakes at each fresh venture. She tried to excuse herself on the plea that, in the Trenor set, if one played at all one must either play high or be set down as priggish or stingy; but she knew that the gambling passion was upon her, and that in her present surroundings there was small hope of resisting it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tonight the luck had been persistently bad, and the little gold purse which hung among her trinkets was almost empty when she returned to her room. She unlocked the wardrobe, and taking out her jewel-case, looked under the tray for the roll of bills from which she had replenished the purse before going down to dinner. Only twenty dollars were left: the discovery was so startling that for a moment she fancied she must have been robbed. Then she took paper and pencil, and seating herself at the writing-table, tried to reckon up what she had spent during the day. Her head was throbbing with fatigue, and she had to go over the figures again and again; but at last it became clear to her that she had lost three hundred dollars at cards. She took out her cheque-book to see if her balance was larger than she remembered, but found she had erred in the other direction. Then she returned to her calculations; but figure as she would, she could not conjure back the vanished three hundred dollars. It was the sum she had set aside to pacify her dress-maker\u2014unless she should decide to use it as a sop to the jeweller. At any rate, she had so many uses for it that its very insufficiency had caused her to play high in the hope of doubling it. But of course she had lost\u2014she who needed every penny, while Bertha Dorset, whose husband showered money on her, must have pocketed at least five hundred, and Judy Trenor, who could have afforded to lose a thousand a night, had left the table clutching such a heap of bills that she had been unable to shake hands with her guests when they bade her good night.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A world in which such things could be seemed a miserable place to Lily Bart; but then she had never been able to understand the laws of a universe which was so ready to leave her out of its calculations.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She began to undress without ringing for her maid, whom she had sent to bed. She had been long enough in bondage to other people's pleasure to be considerate of those who depended on hers, and in her bitter moods it sometimes struck her that she and her maid were in the same position, except that the latter received her wages more regularly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, her face looked hollow and pale, and she was frightened by two little lines near her mouth, faint flaws in the smooth curve of the cheek.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I must stop worrying!\" she exclaimed. \"Unless it's the electric light\u2014\u2014\" she reflected, springing up from her seat and lighting the candles on the dressing-table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She turned out the wall-lights, and peered at herself between the candle-flames. The white oval of her face swam out waveringly from a background of shadows, the uncertain light blurring it like a haze; but the two lines about the mouth remained.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily rose and undressed in haste.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is only because I am tired and have such odious things to think about,\" she kept repeating; and it seemed an added injustice that petty cares should leave a trace on the beauty which was her only defence against them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the odious things were there, and remained with her. She returned wearily to the thought of Percy Gryce, as a wayfarer picks up a heavy load and toils on after a brief rest. She was almost sure she had \"landed\" him: a few days' work and she would win her reward. But the reward itself seemed unpalatable just then: she could get no zest from the thought of victory. It would be a rest from worry, no more\u2014and how little that would have seemed to her a few years earlier! Her ambitions had shrunk gradually in the desiccating air of failure. But why had she failed? Was it her own fault or that of destiny?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She remembered how her mother, after they had lost their money, used to say to her with a kind of fierce vindictiveness: \"But you'll get it all back\u2014you'll get it all back, with your face.\" \u2026 The remembrance roused a whole train of association, and she lay in the darkness reconstructing the past out of which her present had grown.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was \"company\"; a door-bell perpetually ringing; a hall-table showered with square envelopes which were opened in haste, and oblong envelopes which were allowed to gather dust in the depths of a bronze jar; a series of French and English maids giving warning amid a chaos of hurriedly-ransacked wardrobes and dress-closets; an equally changing dynasty of nurses and footmen; quarrels in the pantry, the kitchen and the drawing-room; precipitate trips to Europe, and returns with gorged trunks and days of interminable unpacking; semi-annual discussions as to where the summer should be spent, grey interludes of economy and brilliant reactions of expense\u2014such was the setting of Lily Bart's first memories.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ruling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous and determined figure of a mother still young enough to dance her ball-dresses to rags, while the hazy outline of a neutral-tinted father filled an intermediate space between the butler and the man who came to wind the clocks. Even to the eyes of infancy, Mrs. Hudson Bart had appeared young; but Lily could not recall the time when her father had not been bald and slightly stooping, with streaks of grey in his hair, and a tired walk. It was a shock to her to learn afterward that he was but two years older than her mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily seldom saw her father by daylight. All day he was \"down town\"; and in winter it was long after nightfall when she heard his fagged step on the stairs and his hand on the school-room door. He would kiss her in silence, and ask one or two questions of the nurse or the governess; then Mrs. Bart's maid would come to remind him that he was dining out, and he would hurry away with a nod to Lily. In summer, when he joined them for a Sunday at Newport or Southampton, he was even more effaced and silent than in winter. It seemed to tire him to rest, and he would sit for hours staring at the sea-line from a quiet corner of the verandah, while the clatter of his wife's existence went on unheeded a few feet off. Generally, however, Mrs. Bart and Lily went to Europe for the summer, and before the steamer was half way over Mr. Bart had dipped below the horizon. Sometimes his daughter heard him denounced for having neglected to forward Mrs. Bart's remittances; but for the most part he was never mentioned or thought of till his patient stooping figure presented itself on the New York dock as a buffer between the magnitude of his wife's luggage and the restrictions of the American custom-house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this desultory yet agitated fashion life went on through Lily's teens: a zig-zag broken course down which the family craft glided on a rapid current of amusement, tugged at by the underflow of a perpetual need\u2014the need of more money. Lily could not recall the time when there had been money enough, and in some vague way her father seemed always to blame for the deficiency. It could certainly not be the fault of Mrs. Bart, who was spoken of by her friends as a \"wonderful manager.\" Mrs. Bart was famous for the unlimited effect she produced on limited means; and to the lady and her acquaintances there was something heroic in living as though one were much richer than one's bank-book denoted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily was naturally proud of her mother's aptitude in this line: she had been brought up in the faith that, whatever it cost, one must have a good cook, and be what Mrs. Bart called \"decently dressed.\" Mrs. Bart's worst reproach to her husband was to ask him if he expected her to \"live like a pig\"; and his replying in the negative was always regarded as a justification for cabling to Paris for an extra dress or two, and telephoning to the jeweller that he might, after all, send home the turquoise bracelet which Mrs. Bart had looked at that morning.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily knew people who \"lived like pigs,\" and their appearance and surroundings justified her mother's repugnance to that form of existence. They were mostly cousins, who inhabited dingy houses with engravings from Cole's Voyage of Life on the drawing-room walls, and slatternly parlour-maids who said \"I'll go and see\" to visitors calling at an hour when all right-minded persons are conventionally if not actually out. The disgusting part of it was that many of these cousins were rich, so that Lily imbibed the idea that if people lived like pigs it was from choice, and through the lack of any proper standard of conduct. This gave her a sense of reflected superiority, and she did not need Mrs. Bart's comments on the family frumps and misers to foster her naturally lively taste for splendour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily was nineteen when circumstances caused her to revise her view of the universe.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The previous year she had made a dazzling debut fringed by a heavy thunder-cloud of bills. The light of the debut still lingered on the horizon, but the cloud had thickened; and suddenly it broke. The suddenness added to the horror; and there were still times when Lily relived with painful vividness every detail of the day on which the blow fell. She and her mother had been seated at the luncheon-table, over the CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previous night's dinner: it was one of Mrs. Bart's few economies to consume in private the expensive remnants of her hospitality. Lily was feeling the pleasant languor which is youth's penalty for dancing till dawn; but her mother, in spite of a few lines about the mouth, and under the yellow waves on her temples, was as alert, determined and high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled sleep.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the centre of the table, between the melting MARRONS GLACES and candied cherries, a pyramid of American Beauties lifted their vigorous stems; they held their heads as high as Mrs. Bart, but their rose-colour had turned to a dissipated purple, and Lily's sense of fitness was disturbed by their reappearance on the luncheon-table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I really think, mother,\" she said reproachfully, \"we might afford a few fresh flowers for luncheon. Just some jonquils or lilies-of-the-valley\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bart stared. Her own fastidiousness had its eye fixed on the world, and she did not care how the luncheon-table looked when there was no one present at it but the family. But she smiled at her daughter's innocence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Lilies-of-the-valley,\" she said calmly, \"cost two dollars a dozen at this season.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily was not impressed. She knew very little of the value of money.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It would not take more than six dozen to fill that bowl,\" she argued.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Six dozen what?\" asked her father's voice in the doorway.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two women looked up in surprise; though it was a Saturday, the sight of Mr. Bart at luncheon was an unwonted one. But neither his wife nor his daughter was sufficiently interested to ask an explanation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Bart dropped into a chair, and sat gazing absently at the fragment of jellied salmon which the butler had placed before him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I was only saying,\" Lily began, \"that I hate to see faded flowers at luncheon; and mother says a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley would not cost more than twelve dollars. Mayn't I tell the florist to send a few every day?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She leaned confidently toward her father: he seldom refused her anything, and Mrs. Bart had taught her to plead with him when her own entreaties failed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Bart sat motionless, his gaze still fixed on the salmon, and his lower jaw dropped; he looked even paler than usual, and his thin hair lay in untidy streaks on his forehead. Suddenly he looked at his daughter and laughed. The laugh was so strange that Lily coloured under it: she disliked being ridiculed, and her father seemed to see something ridiculous in the request. Perhaps he thought it foolish that she should trouble him about such a trifle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Twelve dollars\u2014twelve dollars a day for flowers? Oh, certainly, my dear\u2014give him an order for twelve hundred.\" He continued to laugh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bart gave him a quick glance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You needn't wait, Poleworth\u2014I will ring for you,\" she said to the butler.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler withdrew with an air of silent disapproval, leaving the remains of the CHAUFROIX on the sideboard.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What is the matter, Hudson? Are you ill?\" said Mrs. Bart severely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making, and it was odious to her that her husband should make a show of himself before the servants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you ill?\" she repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ill?\u2014\u2014 No, I'm ruined,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily made a frightened sound, and Mrs. Bart rose to her feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ruined\u2014\u2014?\" she cried; but controlling herself instantly, she turned a calm face to Lily.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Shut the pantry door,\" she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily obeyed, and when she turned back into the room her father was sitting with both elbows on the table, the plate of salmon between them, and his head bowed on his hands.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bart stood over him with a white face which made her hair unnaturally yellow. She looked at Lily as the latter approached: her look was terrible, but her voice was modulated to a ghastly cheerfulness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your father is not well\u2014he doesn't know what he is saying. It is nothing\u2014but you had better go upstairs; and don't talk to the servants,\" she added.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily obeyed; she always obeyed when her mother spoke in that voice. She had not been deceived by Mrs. Bart's words: she knew at once that they were ruined. In the dark hours which followed, that awful fact overshadowed even her father's slow and difficult dying. To his wife he no longer counted: he had become extinct when he ceased to fulfil his purpose, and she sat at his side with the provisional air of a traveller who waits for a belated train to start. Lily's feelings were softer: she pitied him in a frightened ineffectual way. But the fact that he was for the most part unconscious, and that his attention, when she stole into the room, drifted away from her after a moment, made him even more of a stranger than in the nursery days when he had never come home till after dark. She seemed always to have seen him through a blur\u2014first of sleepiness, then of distance and indifference\u2014and now the fog had thickened till he was almost indistinguishable. If she could have performed any little services for him, or have exchanged with him a few of those affecting words which an extensive perusal of fiction had led her to connect with such occasions, the filial instinct might have stirred in her; but her pity, finding no active expression, remained in a state of spectatorship, overshadowed by her mother's grim unflagging resentment. Every look and act of Mrs. Bart's seemed to say: \"You are sorry for him now\u2014but you will feel differently when you see what he has done to us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a relief to Lily when her father died.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then a long winter set in. There was a little money left, but to Mrs. Bart it seemed worse than nothing\u2014the mere mockery of what she was entitled to. What was the use of living if one had to live like a pig? She sank into a kind of furious apathy, a state of inert anger against fate. Her faculty for \"managing\" deserted her, or she no longer took sufficient pride in it to exert it. It was well enough to \"manage\" when by so doing one could keep one's own carriage; but when one's best contrivance did not conceal the fact that one had to go on foot, the effort was no longer worth making.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily and her mother wandered from place to place, now paying long visits to relations whose house-keeping Mrs. Bart criticized, and who deplored the fact that she let Lily breakfast in bed when the girl had no prospects before her, and now vegetating in cheap continental refuges, where Mrs. Bart held herself fiercely aloof from the frugal tea-tables of her companions in misfortune. She was especially careful to avoid her old friends and the scenes of her former successes. To be poor seemed to her such a confession of failure that it amounted to disgrace; and she detected a note of condescension in the friendliest advances.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only one thought consoled her, and that was the contemplation of Lily's beauty. She studied it with a kind of passion, as though it were some weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance. It was the last asset in their fortunes, the nucleus around which their life was to be rebuilt. She watched it jealously, as though it were her own property and Lily its mere custodian; and she tried to instil into the latter a sense of the responsibility that such a charge involved. She followed in imagination the career of other beauties, pointing out to her daughter what might be achieved through such a gift, and dwelling on the awful warning of those who, in spite of it, had failed to get what they wanted: to Mrs. Bart, only stupidity could explain the lamentable denouement of some of her examples. She was not above the inconsistency of charging fate, rather than herself, with her own misfortunes; but she inveighed so acrimoniously against love-matches that Lily would have fancied her own marriage had been of that nature, had not Mrs. Bart frequently assured her that she had been \"talked into it\"\u2014by whom, she never made clear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily was duly impressed by the magnitude of her opportunities. The dinginess of her present life threw into enchanting relief the existence to which she felt herself entitled. To a less illuminated intelligence Mrs. Bart's counsels might have been dangerous; but Lily understood that beauty is only the raw material of conquest, and that to convert it into success other arts are required. She knew that to betray any sense of superiority was a subtler form of the stupidity her mother denounced, and it did not take her long to learn that a beauty needs more tact than the possessor of an average set of features.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her ambitions were not as crude as Mrs. Bart's. It had been among that lady's grievances that her husband\u2014in the early days, before he was too tired\u2014had wasted his evenings in what she vaguely described as \"reading poetry\"; and among the effects packed off to auction after his death were a score or two of dingy volumes which had struggled for existence among the boots and medicine bottles of his dressing-room shelves. There was in Lily a vein of sentiment, perhaps transmitted from this source, which gave an idealizing touch to her most prosaic purposes. She liked to think of her beauty as a power for good, as giving her the opportunity to attain a position where she should make her influence felt in the vague diffusion of refinement and good taste. She was fond of pictures and flowers, and of sentimental fiction, and she could not help thinking that the possession of such tastes ennobled her desire for worldly advantages. She would not indeed have cared to marry a man who was merely rich: she was secretly ashamed of her mother's crude passion for money. Lily's preference would have been for an English nobleman with political ambitions and vast estates; or, for second choice, an Italian prince with a castle in the Apennines and an hereditary office in the Vatican. Lost causes had a romantic charm for her, and she liked to picture herself as standing aloof from the vulgar press of the Quirinal, and sacrificing her pleasure to the claims of an immemorial tradition.\u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How long ago and how far off it all seemed! Those ambitions were hardly more futile and childish than the earlier ones which had centred about the possession of a French jointed doll with real hair. Was it only ten years since she had wavered in imagination between the English earl and the Italian prince? Relentlessly her mind travelled on over the dreary interval.\u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After two years of hungry roaming Mrs. Bart had died\u2014\u2014died of a deep disgust. She had hated dinginess, and it was her fate to be dingy. Her visions of a brilliant marriage for Lily had faded after the first year.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"People can't marry you if they don't see you\u2014and how can they see you in these holes where we're stuck?\" That was the burden of her lament; and her last adjuration to her daughter was to escape from dinginess if she could.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't let it creep up on you and drag you down. Fight your way out of it somehow\u2014you're young and can do it,\" she insisted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had died during one of their brief visits to New York, and there Lily at once became the centre of a family council composed of the wealthy relatives whom she had been taught to despise for living like pigs. It may be that they had an inkling of the sentiments in which she had been brought up, for none of them manifested a very lively desire for her company; indeed, the question threatened to remain unsolved till Mrs. Peniston with a sigh announced: \"I'll try her for a year.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every one was surprised, but one and all concealed their surprise, lest Mrs. Peniston should be alarmed by it into reconsidering her decision.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Peniston was Mr. Bart's widowed sister, and if she was by no means the richest of the family group, its other members nevertheless abounded in reasons why she was clearly destined by Providence to assume the charge of Lily. In the first place she was alone, and it would be charming for her to have a young companion. Then she sometimes travelled, and Lily's familiarity with foreign customs\u2014deplored as a misfortune by her more conservative relatives\u2014would at least enable her to act as a kind of courier. But as a matter of fact Mrs. Peniston had not been affected by these considerations. She had taken the girl simply because no one else would have her, and because she had the kind of moral MAUVAISE HONTE which makes the public display of selfishness difficult, though it does not interfere with its private indulgence. It would have been impossible for Mrs. Peniston to be heroic on a desert island, but with the eyes of her little world upon her she took a certain pleasure in her act.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She reaped the reward to which disinterestedness is entitled, and found an agreeable companion in her niece. She had expected to find Lily headstrong, critical and \"foreign\"\u2014for even Mrs. Peniston, though she occasionally went abroad, had the family dread of foreignness\u2014but the girl showed a pliancy, which, to a more penetrating mind than her aunt's, might have been less reassuring than the open selfishness of youth. Misfortune had made Lily supple instead of hardening her, and a pliable substance is less easy to break than a stiff one.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Peniston, however, did not suffer from her niece's adaptability. Lily had no intention of taking advantage of her aunt's good nature. She was in truth grateful for the refuge offered her: Mrs. Peniston's opulent interior was at least not externally dingy. But dinginess is a quality which assumes all manner of disguises; and Lily soon found that it was as latent in the expensive routine of her aunt's life as in the makeshift existence of a continental pension.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Peniston was one of the episodical persons who form the padding of life. It was impossible to believe that she had herself ever been a focus of activities. The most vivid thing about her was the fact that her grandmother had been a Van Alstyne. This connection with the well-fed and industrious stock of early New York revealed itself in the glacial neatness of Mrs. Peniston's drawing-room and in the excellence of her cuisine. She belonged to the class of old New Yorkers who have always lived well, dressed expensively, and done little else; and to these inherited obligations Mrs. Peniston faithfully conformed. She had always been a looker-on at life, and her mind resembled one of those little mirrors which her Dutch ancestors were accustomed to affix to their upper windows, so that from the depths of an impenetrable domesticity they might see what was happening in the street.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Peniston was the owner of a country-place in New Jersey, but she had never lived there since her husband's death\u2014a remote event, which appeared to dwell in her memory chiefly as a dividing point in the personal reminiscences that formed the staple of her conversation. She was a woman who remembered dates with intensity, and could tell at a moment's notice whether the drawing-room curtains had been renewed before or after Mr. Peniston's last illness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Peniston thought the country lonely and trees damp, and cherished a vague fear of meeting a bull. To guard against such contingencies she frequented the more populous watering-places, where she installed herself impersonally in a hired house and looked on at life through the matting screen of her verandah. In the care of such a guardian, it soon became clear to Lily that she was to enjoy only the material advantages of good food and expensive clothing; and, though far from underrating these, she would gladly have exchanged them for what Mrs. Bart had taught her to regard as opportunities. She sighed to think what her mother's fierce energies would have accomplished, had they been coupled with Mrs. Peniston's resources. Lily had abundant energy of her own, but it was restricted by the necessity of adapting herself to her aunt's habits. She saw that at all costs she must keep Mrs. Peniston's favour till, as Mrs. Bart would have phrased it, she could stand on her own legs. Lily had no mind for the vagabond life of the poor relation, and to adapt herself to Mrs. Peniston she had, to some degree, to assume that lady's passive attitude. She had fancied at first that it would be easy to draw her aunt into the whirl of her own activities, but there was a static force in Mrs. Peniston against which her niece's efforts spent themselves in vain. To attempt to bring her into active relation with life was like tugging at a piece of furniture which has been screwed to the floor. She did not, indeed, expect Lily to remain equally immovable: she had all the American guardian's indulgence for the volatility of youth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had indulgence also for certain other habits of her niece's. It seemed to her natural that Lily should spend all her money on dress, and she supplemented the girl's scanty income by occasional \"handsome presents\" meant to be applied to the same purpose. Lily, who was intensely practical, would have preferred a fixed allowance; but Mrs. Peniston liked the periodical recurrence of gratitude evoked by unexpected cheques, and was perhaps shrewd enough to perceive that such a method of giving kept alive in her niece a salutary sense of dependence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond this, Mrs. Peniston had not felt called upon to do anything for her charge: she had simply stood aside and let her take the field. Lily had taken it, at first with the confidence of assured possessorship, then with gradually narrowing demands, till now she found herself actually struggling for a foothold on the broad space which had once seemed her own for the asking. How it happened she did not yet know. Sometimes she thought it was because Mrs. Peniston had been too passive, and again she feared it was because she herself had not been passive enough. Had she shown an undue eagerness for victory? Had she lacked patience, pliancy and dissimulation? Whether she charged herself with these faults or absolved herself from them, made no difference in the sum-total of her failure. Younger and plainer girls had been married off by dozens, and she was nine-and-twenty, and still Miss Bart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was beginning to have fits of angry rebellion against fate, when she longed to drop out of the race and make an independent life for herself. But what manner of life would it be? She had barely enough money to pay her dress-makers' bills and her gambling debts; and none of the desultory interests which she dignified with the name of tastes was pronounced enough to enable her to live contentedly in obscurity. Ah, no\u2014she was too intelligent not to be honest with herself. She knew that she hated dinginess as much as her mother had hated it, and to her last breath she meant to fight against it, dragging herself up again and again above its flood till she gained the bright pinnacles of success which presented such a slippery surface to her clutch.", "http://genius.com/Edith-wharton-the-house-of-mirth-chap-13-annotated"], "2385311": ["Put Me On... by\u00a0Rap\u00a0Genius Users (Ft.\u00a0Glorious\u00a0IQ Bonus)", "Put Me On...

MYSTERIES OF ALBERTINE \u2014 THE GIRLS WHOM SHE SEES REFLECTED IN THE GLASS \u2014 THE OTHER WOMAN \u2014 THE LIFT-BOY \u2014 MADAME DE CAMBREMER \u2014 THE PLEASURES OF M. NISSIM BERNARD \u2014 OUTLINE OF THE STRANGE CHARACTER OF MOREL \u2014 M. DE CHARLUS DINES WITH THE VERDURINS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my fear lest the pleasure I found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother, I sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone; in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart, threw up vast pillars there; but my heart was doubtless too small for it, I had not the strength to bear so great a grief, my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion, and its arches collapsed before joining as, before they have perfected their curve, the waves of the sea totter and break\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if only from my dreams when I was asleep, I might have learned that my grief for my grandmother\u2019s death was diminishing, for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that I had formed of her non-existence. I saw her an invalid still, but on the road to recovery, I found her in better health. And if she made any allusion to what she had suffered, I stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured. I should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers. Only, I no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times. Her words were no more than a feeble, docile response, almost a mere echo of mine; she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incapable as I still was of feeling any fresh physical desire, Albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness. Certain dreams of shared affection, always floating on the surface of our minds, ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory (provided that this has already become slightly vague) of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure. This sentiment recalled to me aspects of Albertine\u2019s face, more gentle, less gay, quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire; and as it was also less pressing than that desire I would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter, without seeking to see Albertine again at Balbec, before her departure. But even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive. From my bed, where I was made to spend hours every day resting, I longed for Albertine to come and resume our former amusements. Do we not see, in the very room in which they have lost a child, its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother? I tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day\u2019s sea. As in the former year, the seas, from one day to another, were rarely the same. Nor, however, did they at all resemble those of that first year, whether because we were now in spring with its storms, or because even if I had come down at the same time as before, the different, more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas, indolent, vaporous and fragile, which I had seen throughout long, scorching days, asleep upon the beach, their bluish bosoms, only, faintly stirring, with a soft palpitation, or, as was most probable, because my eyes, taught by Elstir to retain precisely those elements that before I had deliberately rejected, would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing. The contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that I took with Mme. de Villeparisis and this proximity, fluid, inaccessible, mythological, of the eternal Ocean, no longer existed for me. And there were days now when, on the contrary, the sea itself seemed almost rural. On the days, few and far between, of really fine weather, the heat had traced upon the waters, as it might be across country, a dusty white track, at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishing-boat stood up like a village steeple. A tug, of which one could see only the funnel, was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields, while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white, sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface, made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building, an hospital or a school. And the clouds and the wind, on days when these were added to the sun, completed if not the error of judgment, at any rate the illusion of the first glance, the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination. For the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops, the rough, yellow, almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface, the banks, the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest, all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied, as solid, as broken, as populous, as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which I used to travel, and was soon to be travelling again. And once, unable any longer to hold out against my desire, instead of going back to bed I put on my clothes and started off to Incarville, to find Albertine. I would ask her to come with me to Douville, where I would pay calls at F\u00e9terne upon Mme. de Cambremer and at la Raspeli\u00e8re upon Mme. Verdurin. Albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark. I went to take the train on the local light railway, of which I had picked up, the time before, from Albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district, where it was known as theTwister because of its numberless windings, the Crawler because the train never seemed to move, the Transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line, the Decauville and the Funi, albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff, and, although not, strictly speaking, a Decauville, had a 60 centimetre gauge, the B. A. G. because it ran between Balbec and Grattevast via Angerville, the Tram and the T. S. N. because it was a branch of the Tramways of Southern Normandy. I took my seat in a compartment in which I was alone; it was a day of glorious sunshine, and stiflingly hot; I drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight. But immediately I beheld my grandmother, as she had appeared sitting in the train, on our leaving Paris for Balbec, when, in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer, she had preferred not to look, to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep. I, who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy, I had inflicted this anguish upon her, not merely of seeing me accept, at the invitation of another, a drink which she regarded as bad for me, I had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart\u2019s content, worse still, by my bursts of passion, my choking fits, I had forced her to help, to advise me to do so, with a supreme resignation of which I saw now in my memory the mute, despairing image, her eyes closed to shut out the sight. So vivid a memory had, like the stroke of a magic wand, restored the mood that I had been gradually outgrowing for some time past; what had I to do with Rosemond\u00e9 when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman, what had I to say to the Cambremers and Verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered. I could not remain in the compartment. As soon as the train stopped at Maineville-la-Teinturiere, abandoning all my plans, I alighted. Maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own, because a director of various casinos, a caterer in pleasure, had set up, just outside it, with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel, an establishment to which we shall return anon, and which was, to put it briefly, the first brothel for \u2018exclusive\u2019 people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of France. It was the only one. True, every port has its own, but intended for sailors only, and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see, next door to the primeval parish church, the bawd, hardly less ancient, venerable and moss-grown, standing outside her ill-famed door, waiting for the return of the fishing fleet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrying past the glittering house of \u2018pleasure,\u2019 insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor, I reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of Balbec. I heard, without responding to it, the appeal of the hawthorns. Neighbours, in humbler circumstances, of the blossoming apple trees, they found them very coarse, without denying the fresh complexion of the rosy-petalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider. They knew that, with a lesser dowry, they were more sought after, and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On my return, the hotel porter handed me a black-bordered letter in which the Marquis and the Marquise de Gonneville, the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse d\u2019Amfreville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Berneville, the Marquis and the Marquise de Graincourt, the Comte d\u2019Amenoncourt, the Comtesse de Maineville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Franquetot, the Comtesse de Chaverny n\u00e9e d\u2019Aigleville, begged to announce, and from which I understood at length why it had been sent to me when I caught sight of the names of the Marquise de Cambremer n\u00e9e du Mesnil la Guichard, the Marquis and the Marquise de Cambremer, and saw that the deceased, a cousin of the Cambremers, was named El\u00e9onore-Euphrasie-Humbertine de Cambremer, Comtesse de Criquetot. In the whole extent of this provincial family, the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines, not a single commoner, and on the other hand not a single title that one knew, but the entire muster-roll of the nobles of the region who made their names \u2014 those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood \u2014 ring out their joyous endings in ville, in court, sometimes on a duller note (in tot). Garbed in the roof-tiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church, their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall, and then only to cap themselves with the Norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret, they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues, and to have paraded them in massed formation, without one absentee, one intruder, on the compact, rectangular draught-board of the aristocratic letter edged with black\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother had gone upstairs to her room, meditating the phrase of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cI see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you; the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you, and that annoys me.\u201d\u2014 because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction. To me he whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Parme!\u201d My fears were dispelled when I saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to Her Royal Highness. But as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to Mme. de Luxembourg, the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the Princesse de Parme \u2014 and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no wish to remain there by myself. It was barely four o\u2019clock. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to go and find Albertine, so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue, I think, to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which Albertine was to inspire in me, not to mention the special character, emphatically Gomorrhan, which that mistrust was to assume. Certainly, even that afternoon \u2014 but this was not the first time \u2014 I grew anxious as I was kept waiting. Fran\u00e7oise, once she had started, stayed away so long that I began to despair. I had not lighted the lamp. The daylight had almost gone. The wind was making the flag over the casino flap. And, fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising, and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless, unnatural hour, a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing Viennese waltzes. At length Fran\u00e7oise arrived, but unaccompanied. \u201cI have been as quick as I could but she wouldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t think she was looking smart enough. If she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself, she was an hour by the clock. You\u2019ll be having a regular scentshop in here. She\u2019s coming, she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass. I thought I should find her here.\u201d There was still a long time to wait before Albertine appeared. But the gaiety, the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow. She informed me (in contradiction of what she had said the other day) that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange, as in the former year, to meet daily. I told her that at the moment I was too melancholy and that I would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment, as I did in Paris. \u201cIf ever you\u2019re feeling worried, or feel that you want me, do not hesitate,\u201d she told me, \u201cto send for me, I shall come immediately, and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel, I shall stay as long as you like.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, in bringing her to me, had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful. But Albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy, and the very next day Fran\u00e7oise was to greet me with the profound observation: \u201cMonsieur ought not to see that young lady. I know quite well the sort she is, she\u2019ll land you in trouble.\u201d As I escorted Albertine to the door I saw in the lighted dining-room the Princesse de Parme. I merely gave her a glance, taking care not to be seen. But I must say that I found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the Guermantes\u2019. It is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are, and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand, in his own house, to shew that he is not in his own home but in the Prince\u2019s. Now the Princesse de Parme may not have formulated this idea to herself, but she was so imbued with it that all her actions, spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances, pointed to it. When she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to Aim\u00e9, as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding, before leaving a country house, a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her. Nor did she stop at the tip, but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly, flattering words, with a store of which her mother had provided her. Another moment, and she would have told him that, just as the hotel was perfectly managed, so Normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred France to any other country in the world. Another coin slipped from the Princess\u2019s fingers, for the wine waiter, for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection. The lift-boy had come up at that moment with a message for her; he too received a little speech, a smile and a tip, all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves. As Aim\u00e9, the wine waiter, the lift-boy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them, she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly; such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels, the people who passed by, not knowing who she was, thought they beheld a permanent resident at Balbec, who, because of her humble origin, or for professional reasons (she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne) was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors. As for me, I thought of the palace at Parma, of the counsels, partly religious, partly political, given to this Princess, who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day. All the more, as if she were already reigning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs again to my room, but I was not alone there. I could hear some one softly playing Schumann. No doubt it happens at times that people, even those whom we love best, become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us. There is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain: to wit, a piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends, and had made me write down their addresses as well, in case I should want her on one of those evenings, for none of them lived very far away. This meant that when I tried to find her, going from one girl to another, she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers. I must confess that many of her friends \u2014 I was not yet in love with her \u2014 gave me, at one watering-place or another, moments of pleasure. These obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many. But recently I have thought it over, their names have recurred to me. I counted that, in that one season, a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours. A name came back to me later, which made thirteen. I then, with almost a child\u2019s delight in cruelty, dwelt upon that number. Alas, I realised that I had forgotten the first of them all, Albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had, to resume the thread of my narrative, written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom I should find her upon the days when she was not to be at Incarville, but privately had decided that I would devote those days rather to calling upon Mme. Verdurin. In any case, our desire for different women varies in intensity. One evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who, after that, for the next month or two, will never enter our mind. Then there is the law of change, for a study of which this is not the place, under which, after an over-exertion of the flesh, the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow. As for Albertine, I saw her seldom, and only upon the very infrequent evenings when I felt that I could not live without her. If this desire seized me when she was too far from Balbec for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to go and fetch her, I used to send the lift-boy to Egreville, to La Sogne, to Saint-Frichoux, asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual. He would come into my room, but would leave the door open for, albeit he was conscientious at his \u2018job\u2019 which was pretty hard, consisting in endless cleanings from five o\u2019clock in the morning, he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door, and, if one were to remark to him that it was open, would turn back and, summoning up all his strength, give it a gentle push. With the democratic pride that marked him, a pride to which, in more liberal careers, the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain, barristers, doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a \u2018brother\u2019 barrister, doctor or man of letters, he, employing, and rightly, a term that is confined to close corporations like the Academy, would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days: \u201cI shall get my colleagueto take my place.\u201d This pride did not prevent him from accepting, with a view to increasing what he called his \u2018salary,\u2019 remuneration for his errands, a fact which had made Fran\u00e7oise take a dislike to him: \u201cYes, the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession, but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door. It\u2019s your money he\u2019s after.\u201d This was the category in which she had so often in-cluded Eulalie, and in which, alas (when I think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it), she already placed Albertine, because she saw me often asking Mamma, on behalf of my impecunious friend, for trinkets and other little presents, which Fran\u00e7oise held to be inexcusable because Mme. Bontemps had only a general servant. A moment later the lift-boy, having removed what I should have called his livery and he called his tunic, appeared wearing a straw hat, carrying a cane, holding himself stiffly erect, for his mother had warned him never to adopt the \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018pageboy\u2019 style. Just as, thanks to books, all knowledge is open to a work-ing man, who ceases to be such when he has finished his work, so, thanks to a \u2018boater\u2019 hat and a pair of gloves, elegance became accessible to the lift-boy who, having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs, imagined himself, like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall, or Serjeant Saint-Loup out of uniform, a typical young man about town. He was not for that matter lacking in ambition, or in talent either in manipu-lating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors. But his vocabulary was defective. I credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter, under whom he served: \u201cMy porter,\u201d in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a \u2018private mansion\u2019 in Paris would have referred to his footman. As for the lift-boy\u2019s vocabulary, it is curious that anybody who heard people, fifty times a day, calling for the \u2018lift,\u2019 should never himself call it anything but a \u2018left.\u2019 There were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying: whatever I might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase: \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it, or else to take all the credit for it to himself, as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject. \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed with the utmost emphasis, issued from his lips every other minute, over matters to which he had never given a thought, a trick which irritated me so much that I immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it. But to my second assertion, albeit it was incompatible with the first, he replied none the less stoutly: \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cI say!\u201d as though these words were inevitable. I found it difficult, also, to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling, which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense, in a figurative sense only, which gave them an air of feeble witticism, for instance the verb to pedal. He never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle. But if, on foot, he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time, then, to indicate that he had walked fast, he would exclaim: \u201cI should say I didn\u2019t half pedal!\u201d The lift-boy was on the small side, clumsily built and by no means good looking. This did not prevent him, whenever one spoke to him of some tall, slim, handsome young man, from saying: \u201cOh, yes, I know, a fellow who is just my height.\u201d And one day when I was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message, hearing somebody come upstairs, I had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as Endymion, with incredibly perfect features, who was bringing a message to a lady whom I did not know. When the lift-boy returned, in telling him how impatiently I had waited for the answer, I mentioned to him that I had thought I heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the H\u00f4tel de Normandie. \u201cOh, yes, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have only the one, a boy about my build. He\u2019s so like me in face, too, that we\u2019re always being mistaken; anybody would think he was my brother.\u201d Lastly, he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second, which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say: \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me; but other people, as we get to know them, are like a metal dipped in an acid bath, and we see them gradually lose their good qualities (and their bad qualities too, at times). Before giving him my instructions, I saw that he had left the door open; I pointed this out to him, I was afraid that people might hear us; he acceded to my request and returned, having reduced the gap. \u201cAnything to oblige. But there\u2019s nobody on this floor except us two.\u201d Immediately I heard one, then a second, then a third person go by. This annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard, but more still because I could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence. \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be the maid next door going for her things. Oh, that\u2019s of no importance, it\u2019s the bottler putting away his keys. No, no, it\u2019s nothing, you can say what you want, it\u2019s my colleague just going on duty.\u201d Then, as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me, at a formal order from me he went, not to shut the door, which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a \u2018motor,\u2019 but to push it a little closer to. \u201cNow we shall be quite quiet.\u201d So quiet were we that an American lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room. \u201cYou are going to bring this young lady back with you,\u201d I told him, after first going and banging the door with all my might (which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open). \u201cYou remember the name: Mlle. Albertine Simonet. Anyhow, it\u2019s on the envelope. You need only say to her that it\u2019s from me. She will be delighted to come,\u201d I added, to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own self-esteem. \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cNot at all, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come. It\u2019s a great nuisance getting here from Berneville.\u201d \u201cI understand!\u201d \u201cYou will tell her to come with you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand perfectly,\u201d he replied, in that sharp, precise tone which had long ceased to make a \u2018good impression\u2019 upon me because I knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t any too much time,\u201d said the lift-boy, who, carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs, omitted the pronoun altogether. \u201cCan go there all right. Leave was stopped this afternoon, because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon. And it was my turn off duty to-day. So it\u2019s all right if I go out a bit this evening. Take my bike with me. Get there in no time.\u201d And an hour later he reappeared and said: \u201cMonsieur\u2019s had to wait, but the young lady\u2019s come with me. She\u2019s down below.\u201d \u201cOh, thanks very much; the porter won\u2019t be cross with me?\u201d \u201cMonsieur Paul? Doesn\u2019t even know where I\u2019ve been. The head of the door himself can\u2019t say a word.\u201d But once, after I had told him: \u201cYou absolutely must bring her back with you,\u201d he reported to me with a smile: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her. She\u2019s not there. Couldn\u2019t wait any longer; was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was \u2018missed from the hotel\u201d (for the lift-boy, who used the word \u2018rejoin\u2019 of a profession which one joined for the first time, \u201cI should like to rejoin the post-office,\u201d to make up for this, or to mitigate the calamity, were his own career at stake, or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else, elided the prefix and said: \u201cI know he\u2019s been \u2018missed\u201d). It was not with any evil intent that he smiled, but from sheer timidity. He thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it. In the same way, if he had said to me: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d this did not mean that he really thought that I knew it already. On the contrary, he was all too certain that I did not know it, and, what was more, was afraid to tell me. And so he said \u2018you know\u2019 to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge. We ought never to lose our tempers with people who, when we find fault with them, begin to titter. They do so not because they are laughing at us, but because they are trembling lest we should be angry. Let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh. For all the world like a stroke, the lift-boy\u2019s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar. He wound up by telling me that Albertine was not at Egreville, that she would not be coming back there before nine o\u2019clock, and that if betimes (which meant, by chance) she came back earlier, my message would be given her, and in any case she would be with me before one o\u2019clock in the morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Translator\u2019s note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume I ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not this evening, however, that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form. No, to make no mystery about it, although the incident did not occur until some weeks later, it arose out of a remark made by Cottard. Albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at Incarville where, as luck would have it, I should not have joined them (having intended to go and see Mme. Verdurin who had invited me again and again), had I not been held up at Incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair. As I strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it, I found myself all of a sudden face to face with Doctor Cottard, who had come to Incarville to see a patient. I almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters. But friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people. Not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as well-bred people, Cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing, even denying their existence, until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them. He apologised, had indeed received my letters, had reported my whereabouts to the Verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see. He even proposed to take me to them there and then, for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner. As I hesitated and he had still some time before his train ( for there was bound to be still a considerable delay), I made him come with me to the little casino, one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival, now filled with the tumult of the girls, who, in the absence of male partners, were dancing together. Andr\u00e9e came sliding along the floor towards me; I was meaning to go off with Cottard in a moment to the Verdurins\u2019, when I definitely declined his offer, seized by an irresistible desire to stay with Albertine. The fact was, I had just heard her laugh. And her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh, the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way, seeming also, as strong, sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums, to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance, irritant and secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the girls, a stranger to me, sat down at the piano, and Andr\u00e9e invited Albertine to waltz with her. Happy in the thought that I was going to remain in this little casino with these girls, I remarked to Cottard how well they danced together. But he, taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an ill-breeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends, although he must have seen me shaking hands with them, replied: \u201cYes, but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits. I should certainly never let mine come here. Are they nice-looking, though? I can\u2019t see their faces. There now, look,\u201d he went on, pointing to Albertine and Andr\u00e9e who were waltzing slowly, tightly clasped together, \u201cI have left my glasses behind and I don\u2019t see very well, but they are certainly keenly roused. It is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts. And theirs, as you see, are completely touching.\u201d And indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of Andr\u00e9e and of Albertine. I do not know whether they heard or guessed Cottard\u2019s observation, but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz. At that moment Andr\u00e9e said something to Albertine, who laughed, the same deep and penetrating laugh that I had heard before. But all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain; Albertine appeared to be revealing by it, to be making Andr\u00e9e share some exquisite, secret thrill. It rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited. I left the place with Cottard, distracted by his conversation, thinking only at odd moments of the scene I had just witnessed. This does not mean that Cottard\u2019s conversation was interesting. It had indeed, at that moment, become bitter, for we had just seen Doctor du Boulbon go past without noticing us. He had come down to spend some time on the other side of Balbec bay, where he was greatly in demand. Now, albeit Cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays, he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast, a hope which du Boulbon\u2019s presence there doomed to disappointment. Certainly, the Balbec doctor could not stand in Cottard\u2019s way. He was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything, and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing, in a complicated formula, the ointment, lotion or liniment that would put you right. As Marie Gineste used to say, in her charming speech, he knew how to \u2018charm\u2019 cuts and sores. But he was in no way eminent. He had indeed caused Cottard some slight annoyance. The latter, now that he was anxious to exchange his Chair for that of Therapeutics, had begun to specialise in toxic actions. These, a perilous innovation in medicine, give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists\u2019 shops, where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic, unlike its substitutes, and indeed to be disintoxicant. It is the fashionable cry; at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering, like the faint trace of an older fashion, the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected. Toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient, who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance. Now, a Grand Duke who had come for a few days to Balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for Cottard who, in return for a wad of hundred-franc notes (the Professor refused to see anyone for less), had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment. As the swelling did not go down, the Grand Duke fell back upon the general practitioner of Balbec, who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust. The following day, the swelling had gone. A celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was, however, a more dangerous rival. He was a rubicund, jovial person, since, for one thing, the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health, but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good-bye,\u2019 while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in strait-waistcoats later on. Nevertheless, whenever you spoke to him at a party, whether of politics or of literature, he would listen to you with a kindly attention, as though he were saying: \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d without at once giving an opinion, as though it were a matter for consultation. But anyhow he, whatever his talent might be, was a specialist. And so the whole of Cottard\u2019s rage was heaped upon du Boulbon. But I soon bade good-bye to the Verdurins\u2019 professional friend, and returned to Balbec, after promising him that I would pay them a visit before long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mischief that his remarks about Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had done me was extreme, but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me, as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, on the night after the lift-boy had gone in search of her, did not appear, notwithstanding his assurances. Certainly, personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as: \u201cNo, this evening I shall not be free.\u201d We barely notice this speech if we are with friends; we are gay all the evening, a certain image never enters our mind; during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution; when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear. We become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before, because, even if we continue not to fear death, we no longer dare think of a parting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From, however, not one o\u2019clock in the morning (the limit fixed by the lift-boy), but three o\u2019clock, I no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish. The certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete, refreshing calm; this night was simply a night like all the rest during which I did not see her, such was the idea from which I started. After which, the thought that I should see her in the morning, or some other day, outlining itself upon the blank which I submissively accepted, became pleasant. Sometimes, during these nights of waiting, our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken. The sufferer, misinterpreting his own symptoms, thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear. Love is engendered in these cases, as are certain nervous maladies, by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort. An explanation which it is useless to correct, at any rate so far as love is concerned, a sentiment which (whatever its cause) is invariably in error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day, when Albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to Epreville, and so had not received my note in time, and was coming, if she might, to see me that evening, behind the words of her letter, as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone, I thought I could detect the presence of pleasures, of people whom she had preferred to me. Once again, I was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing, by the latent love which we always carry within us; I almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to Albertine, but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing, the last echo of which died away without the machine\u2019s having been set in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had failed during my first visit to Balbec \u2014 and perhaps, for that matter, Andr\u00e9e had failed equally \u2014 to understand Albertine\u2019s character. I had put it down as frivolous, but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a garden-party, a donkey ride, a picnic. During my second visit to Balbec, I began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show, the garden-party a mere screen, if not an invention. She shewed herself in various colours in the following incident (by which I mean the incident as seen by me, from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent, and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side). Albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection. She looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home, it appeared, every afternoon at five o\u2019clock, at Infreville. Tormented by suspicion, and feeling at the same time far from well, I asked Albertine, I implored her to remain with me. It was impossible (and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer) because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable, highly susceptible and, said Albertine, a perfect nuisance. \u201cBut one can easily cut a call.\u201d \u201cNo, my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness.\u201d \u201cBut I have so often seen you being impolite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt. I\u2019m pretty well in her bad books already. She expects me to go and see her.\u201d \u201cBut if she\u2019s at home every day?\u201d Here Albertine, feeling that she was caught, changed her line of argument. \u201cSo she is at home every day. But to-day I\u2019ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there. It will be less boring that way.\u201d \u201cSo then, Albertine, you prefer this lady and your friends to me, since, rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call, you prefer to leave me here alone, sick and wretched?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is boring. I\u2019m going for their sake. I shall bring them home in my trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t have any way of getting back.\u201d I pointed out to Albertine that there were trains from Infreville up to ten o\u2019clock at night. \u201cQuite true, but don\u2019t you see, it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner. She is very hospitable.\u201d \u201cVery well then, you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI should only make my aunt angry.\u201d \u201cBesides, you can dine with her and catch the ten o\u2019clock train.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cutting it rather fine.\u201d \u201cThen I can never go and dine in town and come back by train. But listen, Albertine. We are going to do something quite simple, I feel that^the fresh air will do me good; since you can\u2019t give up your lady, I am going to come with you to Infreville. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shan\u2019t go as far as the Tour Elisabeth\u201d (the lady\u2019s villa), \u201cI shall see neither the lady nor your friends.\u201d Albertine started as though she had received a violent blow. For a moment, she was unable to speak. She explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to come with you?\u201d \u201cHow can you say such a thing, you know there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than going out with you.\u201d A sudden change of tactics had occurred. \u201cSince we are going for a drive together,\u201d she said to me, \u201cwhy not go out in the other direction, we might dine together. It would be so nice. After all, that side of Balbec is much the prettier. I\u2019m getting sick of Infreville and all those little spinach-bed places.\u201d \u201cBut your aunt\u2019s friend will be annoyed if you don\u2019t go and see her.\u201d \u201cVery well, let her be.\u201d \u201cNo, it is wrong to annoy people.\u201d \u201cBut she won\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m not there, she has people every day; I can go to-morrow, the next day, next week, the week after, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ve cut me often enough. It\u2019s my turn now.\u201d \u201cBut from the side you suggest there\u2019s no train back after nine.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? Nine will do perfectly. Besides, one need never think about getting back. We can always find a cart, a bike, if the worse comes to the worst, we have legs.\u201d \u201cWe can always find, Albertine, how you go on! Out Infreville way, where the villages run into one another, well and good. But the other way, it\u2019s a very different matter.\u201d \u201cThat way too. I promise to bring you back safe and sound.\u201d I felt that Albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me, and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as I was. Seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question, since I insisted upon accompanying her, she gave it up altogether. She knew that the loss was not irremediable. For, like all women who have a number of irons in the fire, she had one resource that never failed: suspicion and jealousy. Of course she did not seek to arouse them, quite the contrary. But lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood. With the result that Albertine, being no better than anyone else, knew by experience (without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy) that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment. The stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt, would love her all the more for that (though Albertine did not know that this was the reason), and, so as not to prolong the agony, would return to her of his own accord, as I should have done. But I had no desire either to give pain to another, or to tire myself, or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation, of multiform, unending vigilance. \u201cNo, Albertine, I do not wish to spoil your pleasure, go to your lady at Infreville, or rather to the person you really mean to see, it is all the same to me. The real reason why I am not coming with you is that you do not wish it, the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take, which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it.\u201d Poor Albertine was afraid that her contradictions, which she had not noticed, had been more serious than they were. Not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me: \u201cIt is quite on the cards that I did contradict myself. The sea air makes me lose my head altogether. I\u2019m always calling things by the wrong names.\u201d And (what proved to me that she would not, now, require many tender affirmations to make me believe her) I felt a stab in my heart as I listened to this admission of what I had but faintly imagined. \u201cVery well, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m off,\u201d she said in a tragic tone, not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person, now that I had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad of you. I alter all my plans to spend a nice, long evening with you, and it\u2019s you that won\u2019t have it, and you accuse me of telling lies. I\u2019ve never known you to be so cruel. The sea shall be my tomb. I will never see you any more.\u201d (My heart leaped at these words, albeit I was certain that she would come again next day, as she did.) \u201cI shall drown myself, I shall throw myself into the water.\u201d \u201cLike Sappho.\u201d \u201cThere you go, insulting me again. You suspect not only what I say but what I do.\u201d \u201cBut, my lamb, I didn\u2019t mean anything, I swear to you, you know Sappho flung herself into the sea.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, you have no faith in me.\u201d She saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock; she was afraid of missing her appointment, and choosing the shortest form of farewell (for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day, the other person presumably not being free then), she dashed from the room, crying: \u201cGood-bye for ever,\u201d in a heartbroken tone. And perhaps she was heartbroken. For knowing what she was about at that moment better than I, being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than I was towards her, she may all the same have had a fear that I might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me. And I believe that she was attached to me, so much so that the other person was more jealous than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, at Balbec, while we were in the ballroom of the casino, there entered Bloch\u2019s sister and cousin, who had both turned out quite pretty, but whom I refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends, because the younger one, the cousin, was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit. Andr\u00e9e, at a murmured allusion to this scandal, said to me: \u201cOh! About that sort of thing I\u2019m like Albertine; there\u2019s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing.\u201d As for Albertine, on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa, she had turned her back on the disreputable pair. I had noticed, however, that, before she changed her position, at the moment when Mlle. Bloch and her cousin appeared, my friend\u2019s eyes had flashed with that sudden, close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious, indeed a grave air, and left her pensive afterwards. But Albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative. Mlle. Bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner, I asked Albertine whether the little fair one (the one who was so intimate with the actress) was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cis one of them fair? I must confess they don\u2019t interest me particularly, I have never looked at them. Is one of them fair?\u201d she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry. When applied to people whom Albertine passed every day on the front, this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appear to be looking at us much either,\u201d I said to Albertine, perhaps (on the assumption, which I did not however consciously form, that Albertine loved her own sex), to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that, generally speaking, it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know. \u201cThey weren\u2019t looking at us!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s astonished reply. \u201cWhy, they did nothing else the whole time.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly tell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cyou had your back to them.\u201d \u201cVery well, and what about that?\u201d she replied, pointing out to me, set in the wall in front of us, a large mirror which I had not noticed and upon which I now realised that my friend, while talking to me, had never ceased to fix her troubled, preoccupied eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the day when Cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at Incarville, albeit I did not share the opinion that he had expressed, Albertine had seemed to me different; the sight of her made me lose my temper. I myself had changed, quite as much as she had changed in my eyes. I had ceased to bear her any good will; to her face, behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her, I spoke of her in the most insulting language. There were, however, intervals of calmer feeling. One day I learned that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had both accepted an invitation to Elstir\u2019s. Feeling certain that this was in order that they might, on the return journey, amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women, and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart, without announcing my intention, to embarrass them and to deprive Albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning, I paid an unexpected call at his studio. But I found only Andr\u00e9e there. Albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her. Then I said to myself that Cottard must have been mistaken; the favourable impression that I received from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards Albertine. But this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies, who are prostrated again by the merest trifle. Albertine incited Andr\u00e9e to actions which, without going very far, were perhaps not altogether innocent; pained by this suspicion, I managed in the end to repel it. No sooner was I healed of it than it revived under another form. I had just seen Andr\u00e9e, with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her, lay her head coaxingly on Albertine\u2019s shoulder, kiss her on the throat, half shutting her eyes; or else they had exchanged a glance; a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe: little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood, but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them. Sometimes even without my having seen Albertine again, without anyone\u2019s having spoken to me about her, there would flash from my memory some vision of her with Gis\u00e8le in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time; it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that I had managed to recover, I had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside, I had, as Cottard would have said, supplied my own toxin. I thought then of all that I had been told about Swann\u2019s love for Odette, of the way in which Swann had been tricked all his life. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of Albertine\u2019s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that I could not control in its entirety, was the memory, the rooted idea of Mme. Swann\u2019s character, as it had been described to me. These accounts helped my imagination, in after years, to take the line of supposing that Albertine might, instead of being a good girl, have had the same immorality, the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute, and I thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had I ever really been her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, outside the Grand Hotel, where we were gathered on the front, I had just been addressing Albertine in the harshest, most humiliating language, and Rosemonde was saying: \u201cOh, how you have changed your mind about her; why, she used to be everything, it was she who ruled the roost, and now she isn\u2019t even fit to be thrown to the dogs.\u201d I was beginning, in order to make my attitude towards Albertine still more marked, to say all the nicest things I could think of to Andr\u00e9e, who, if she was tainted with the same vice, seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic, when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front, at the corner of which we were standing, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s barouche. The chief magistrate who, at that moment, was advancing towards us, sprang back upon recognising the carriage, in order not to be seen in our company; then, when he thought that the Marquise\u2019s eye might catch his, bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat. But the carriage, instead of continuing, as might have been expected, along the Rue de la Mer, disappeared through the gate of the hotel. It was quite ten minutes later when the lift-boy, out of breath, came to announce to me: \u201cIt\u2019s the Marquise de Camembert, she\u2019s come here to see Monsieur. I\u2019ve been up to the room, I looked in the reading-room, I couldn\u2019t find Monsieur anywhere. Luckily I thought of looking on the beach.\u201d He had barely ended this speech when, followed by her daughter-in-law and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman, the Marquise advanced towards me, coming on probably from some afternoon tea-party in the neighbourhood, and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself, in order to appear as \u2018well dressed\u2019 as possible to the people whom she went to visit. It was in fact that \u2018landing\u2019 of the Cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let Legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to Balbec. Then Mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible. And here it was actually happening, but by different channels and without Legrandin\u2019s having had any part in it. \u201cDo you mind my staying here, if I shan\u2019t be in your way?\u201d asked Albertine (in whose eyes there lingered, brought there by the cruel things I had just been saying to her, a pair of tears which I observed without seeming to see them, but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight), \u201cthere is something I want to say to you.\u201d A hat with feathers, itself surmounted by a sapphire pin, was perched haphazard upon Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s wig, like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient, its place immaterial, its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous. Notwithstanding the heat, the good lady had put on a jet cloak, like a dalmatic, over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season, but upon the nature of the ceremony. And on Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s bosom a baronial torse, fastened to a chain, dangled like a pectoral cross. The gentleman was an eminent lawyer from Paris, of noble family, who had come down to spend a few days with the Cambremers. He was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession, and who say, for instance: \u201cI know that I am a good pleader, so it no longer amuses me to plead,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in operating, I know that I\u2019m a good operator.\u201d Men of intelligence, artists, they see themselves in their maturity, richly endowed by success, shining with that intellect, that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment. They form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist, but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished, and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them. Le Sidaner was the artist chosen by the Cambremers\u2019 friend, who incidentally was a delightful person. He talked well about books, but not about the books of the true masters, those who have mastered themselves. The only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions, such as \u2018for the most part,\u2019 which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking. Madame de Cambremer had taken the opportunity, she told me, of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the Balbec direction to come and call upon me, as she had promised Robert de Saint-Loup. \u201cYou know he\u2019s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days: His uncle Charlus is staying near here with his sister-in-law, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, and M. de Saint-Loup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment, where he is very popular, highly respected. We often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises. How nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to F\u00e9terne.\u201d I presented Albertine and her friends. Mme. de Cambremer introduced us all to her daughter-in-law. The latter, so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at F\u00e9terne forced her to associate, so reserved, so afraid of compromising herself, held out her hand to me with a radiant smile, safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of Robert de Saint-Loup, whom he, possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear, had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the Guermantes. So, unlike her mother-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness. It was at the most the former kind, dry, insupportable, that she would have conceded me had I met her through her brother Legrandin. But for a friend of the Guermantes she had not smiles enough. The most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the reading-room, that place once so terrible into which I now went a dozen times every day, emerging freely, my own master, like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey. And so I offered to take Mme. de Cambremer there. And as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me, since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people, it was without the slightest emotion that I made this suggestion. But she declined it, preferring to remain out of doors, and we sat down in the open air, on the terrace of the hotel. I found there and rescued a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which Mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight, when she heard that visitors had called for me. No less than my grandmother, she dreaded these invasions of strangers, and, in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen, would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her. Madame de Cambremer carried in her hand, with the handle of a sunshade, a number of embroidered bags, a hold-all, a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets, and a lace handkerchief. I could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair; but I felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood. We gazed at the calm sea upon which, here and there, a few gulls floated like white petals. Because of the \u2018mean level\u2019 to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which, we suppose, ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us, I began instinctively to talk to Mme. de Cambremer n\u00e9e Legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked. \u201cThey appear,\u201d I said, referring to the gulls, \u201cas motionless and as white as water-lilies.\u201d And indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about, so much so that the waves, by contrast, seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention, to have acquired life. The dowager Marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from Balbec, or to say how she envied it, she who from la Raspeli\u00e8re (where for that matter she was not living that year) had only such a distant glimpse of the waves. She had two remarkable habits, due at once to her exalted passion for the arts (especially for the art of music), and to her want of teeth. Whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands \u2014 like those of certain animals when in rut \u2014 became so overcharged that the old lady\u2019s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place. Immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh, like a person recovering his breath. Secondly, if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty, in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions, vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose. Now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at Balbec could indeed offer a \u2018seascape,\u2019 and Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s simple words changed my ideas in that respect. On the other hand, as I told her, I had always heard people praise the matchless view from la Raspeli\u00e8re, perched on the summit of the hill, where, in a great drawing-room with two fireplaces, one whole row of windows swept the gardens, and, through the branches of the trees, the sea as far as Balbec and beyond it, and the other row the valley. \u201cHow nice of you to say so, and how well you put it: the sea through the branches. It is exquisite, one would say . . . a painted fan.\u201d And I gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches, that the compliment was sincere. But the Marquise n\u00e9e Legrandin remained cold, to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her mother-in-law. Besides, she not only despised the other\u2019s intellect but deplored her affability, being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the Cambremers. \u201cAnd how charming the name is,\u201d said I. \u201cOne would like to know the origin of all those names.\u201d \u201cThat one I can tell you,\u201d the old lady answered modestly. \u201cIt is a family place, it came from my grandmother Arrachepel, not an illustrious family, but a decent and very old country stock.\u201d \u201cWhat! Not illustrious!\u201d her daughter-in-law tartly interrupted her. \u201cA whole window in Bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms, and the principal church at Avranches has their tombs. If these old names interest you,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve come a year too late. We managed to appoint to the living of Criquetot, in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another, the parish priest of a place where I myself have some land, a long way from here, Combray, where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic. Unfortunately, the sea air was no good to him at his age; his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to Combray. But he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters, and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district. It has given him a fresh interest, too, for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon Combray and its surroundings. I shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of F\u00e9terne. It is worthy of a Benedictine. You will find the most interesting things in it about our old Raspeli\u00e8re, of which my mother-in-law speaks far too modestly.\u201d \u201cIn any case, this year,\u201d replied the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cla Raspeli\u00e8re is no longer ours and does not belong to me. But I can see that you have a painter\u2019s instincts; I am sure you sketch, and I should so like to shew you F\u00e9terne, which is far finer than la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d For as soon as the Cambremers had let this latter residence to the Verdurins, its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past, that is to say to offer the advantage, without parallel in the neighbourhood, of looking out over both sea and valley, and had on the other hand, suddenly and retrospectively, presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it. In short, one might have supposed that if Mme. de Cambremer had let it, it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses. And she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand, at F\u00e9terne, she who for so many years (forgetting the two months that she spent there) had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama. \u201cI am discovering it at my age,\u201d she said, \u201cand how I enjoy it! It does me a world of good. I would let la Raspeli\u00e8re for nothing so as to be obliged to live at F\u00e9terne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo return to more interesting topics,\u201d went on Legrandin\u2019s sister, who addressed the old Marquise as \u2018Mother,\u2019 but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence, \u201cyou mentioned water-lilies: I suppose you know Claude Monet\u2019s pictures of them. What a genius! They interest me particularly because near Combray, that place where I told you I had some land. . . . \u201d But she preferred not to talk too much about Combray. \u201cWhy! That must be the series that Elstir told us about, the greatest painter of this generation,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, who had said nothing so far. \u201cAh! I can see that this young lady loves the arts,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer and, drawing a long breath, recaptured a trail of spittle. \u201cYou will allow me to put Le Sidaner before him, Mademoiselle,\u201d said the lawyer, smiling with the air of an expert. And, as he had enjoyed, or seen people enjoy, years ago, certain \u2018daring\u2019 work by Elstir, he added: \u201cElstir was gifted, indeed he was one of the advance guard, but for some reason or other he never kept up, he has wasted his life.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer disagreed with the lawyer, so far as Elstir was concerned, but, greatly to the annoyance of her guest, bracketed Monet with Le Sidaner. It would be untrue to say that she was a fool; she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me. As the sun was beginning to set, the seagulls were now yellow, like the water-lilies on another canvas of that series by Monet. I said that I knew it, and (continuing to copy the diction of her brother, whom I had not yet dared to name) added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier, for, at the same hour, there would have been a Poussin light for her to admire. Had some Norman squireen, unknown to the Guermantes, told her that she ought to have come a day earlier, Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air. But I might have been far more familiar still, and she would have been all smiles and sweetness; I might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which Mme. de Cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests. But the name of Poussin, without altering the amenity of the society lady, called forth the protests of the connoisseur. On hearing that name, she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, after a painter like Monet, who is an absolute genius, don\u2019t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent, like Poussin. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that I find him the deadliest bore. I mean to say, you can\u2019t really call that sort of thing painting. Monet, Degas, Manet, yes, there are painters if you like! It is a curious thing,\u201d she went on, fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind, \u201cit is a curious thing, I used at one time to prefer Manet. Nowadays, I still admire Manet, of course, but I believe I like Monet even more. Oh! The Cathedrals!\u201d She was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste. And one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not, in her eyes, any less important than the different manners of Monet himself. Not that I had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences, for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them. When a noble dame of Avranches, who would have been incapable of distinguishing between Mozart and Wagner, said in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing: \u201cWe saw nothing of any interest while we were in Paris, we went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, they were doing Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, it\u2019s dreadful stuff,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d and to \u2018argue the point.\u2019 It was perhaps a Combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother\u2019s sisters, who called it \u2018fighting in the good cause,\u2019 and loved the dinner-parties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the Philistines. Similarly, Mme. de Cambremer liked to \u2018fly into a passion\u2019 and wrangle about art, as other people do about politics. She stood up for Debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised. She must however have known very well that when she said: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d she could not improvise in the other lady, whom she was putting in her place, the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion. \u201cI must ask Le Sidaner what he thinks of Poussin,\u201d the lawyer remarked to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular recluse, never opens his mouth, but I know how to get things out of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnyhow,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer went on, \u201cI have a horror of sunsets, they\u2019re so romantic, so operatic. That is why I can\u2019t abide my mother-in-law\u2019s house, with its tropical plants. You will see it, it\u2019s just like a public garden at Monte-Carlo. That\u2019s why I prefer your coast, here. It is more sombre, more sincere; there\u2019s a little lane from which one doesn\u2019t see the sea. On rainy days, there\u2019s nothing but mud, it\u2019s a little world apart. It\u2019s just the same at Venice, I detest the Grand Canal and I don\u2019t know anything so touching as the little alleys. But it\u2019s all a question of one\u2019s surroundings.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I remarked to her, feeling that the only way to rehabilitate Poussin in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion, \u201cM. Degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the Poussins at Chantilly.\u201d \u201cIndeed? I don\u2019t know the ones at Chantilly,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer who had no wish to differ from Degas, \u201cbut I can speak about the ones in the Louvre, which are appalling.\u201d \u201cHe admires them immensely too.\u201d \u201cI must look at them again. My impressions of them are rather distant,\u201d she replied after a moment\u2019s silence, and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain, before very long, to form of Poussin would depend, not upon the information that I had just communicated to her, but upon the supplementary and, this time, final examination that she intended to make of the Poussins in the Louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind. Contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since, if she did not yet admire the Poussins, she was adjourning the matter for further consideration, in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer, I told her mother-in-law how much I had heard of the wonderful flowers at F\u00e9terne. In modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house, into which in the mornings, by simply pushing open a door, she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks, hunt for new-laid eggs, and gather the zinnias or roses which, on the sideboard, framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers, reminded her of her garden paths. \u201cIt is true, we have a great many roses,\u201d she told me, \u201cour rose garden is almost too near the house, there are days when it makes my head ache. It is nicer on the terrace at la Raspeli\u00e8re where the breeze carries the scent of the roses, but it is not so heady.\u201d I turned to her daughter-in-law. \u201cIt is just like Pell\u00e9as,\u201d I said to her, to gratify her taste for the modern, \u201cthat scent of roses wafted up to the terraces. It is so strong in the score that, as I suffer from hay-fever and rose-fever, it sets me sneezing every time I listen to that scene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a marvellous thing Pell\u00e9as is,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cI\u2019m mad about it;\u201d and, drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me, using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes, she began to hum something which, I supposed, represented to her the farewells of Pell\u00e9as, and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that Mme. de Cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it. \u201cI think it is even finer than Parsifal,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause in Parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases, which are bad simply because they are melodious.\u201d \u201cI know, you are a great musician, Madame,\u201d I said to the dowager. \u201cI should so much like to hear you play.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation. Being of the opinion that what her mother-in-law liked was not music at all, she regarded the talent, a sham talent according to her, though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest. It was true that Chopin\u2019s only surviving pupil declared, and with justice, that the Master\u2019s style of playing, his \u2018feeling\u2019 had been transmitted, through herself, to Mme. de Cambremer alone, but to play like Chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of Legran-din\u2019s sister, who despised nobody so much as the Polish composer. \u201cOh! They are flying away,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, pointing to the gulls which, casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito, were rising in a body towards the sun. \u201cTheir giant wings from walking hinder them,\u201d quoted Mme. de Cambremer, confusing the seagull with the albatross. \u201cI do love them; I used to see them at Amsterdam,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cThey smell of the sea, they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even.\u201d \u201cOh! So you have been in Holland, you know the Vermeers?\u201d Mme. de Cambremer asked imperiously, in the tone in which she would have said: \u201cYou know the Guermantes?\u201d for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent. Albertine replied in the negative, thinking that they were living people. But her mistake was not apparent. \u201cI should be delighted to play to you,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me. \u201cBut you know I only play things that no longer appeal to your generation. I was brought up in the worship of Chopin,\u201d she said in a lowered tone, for she was afraid of her daughter-in-law, and knew that to the latter, who considered that Chopin was not music, playing him well or badly were meaningless terms. She admitted that her mother-in-law had technique, was a finished pianist. \u201cNothing will ever make me say that she is a musician,\u201d was Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin\u2019s conclusion. Because she considered herself \u2018advanced,\u2019 because (hi matters of art only) \u201cone could never move far enough to the Left,\u201d she said, she maintained not merely that music progressed, but that it progressed along one straight line, and that Debussy was in a sense a super-Wagner, slightly more advanced again than Wagner. She did not take into account the fact that if Debussy was not as independent of Wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years\u2019 time, because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered, he was seeking nevertheless, after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete, in which everything was expressed, to satisfy an opposite demand. There were theories of course, to support this reaction for the time being, like those theories which, in politics, come to the support of the laws against religious communities, of wars in the East (unnatural teaching, the Yellow Peril, etc., etc.). People said that an age of speed required rapidity in art, precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight, or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches, which the motor-car, for all that, was to restore to favour. Composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience, as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention, among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest. For the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to Bayreuth to listen to the Ring. Besides, the day was to come when, for a season, Debussy would be pronounced as trivial as Massenet, and the trills of M\u00e9lisande degraded to the level of Manon\u2019s. For theories and schools, like microbes and corpuscles, devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence. But that time was still to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on the Stock Exchange, when a rise occurs, a whole group of securities benefit by it, so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction, either because they did not deserve such scorn, or simply \u2014 which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises \u2014 because they had incurred it. And people even went the length of seeking out, in an isolated past, men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence, but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably. Often it was because a master, whoever he may be, however exclusive his school, judges in the light of his own untutored instincts, does justice to talent wherever it be found, or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past, which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence. Or, it may be, because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create. Then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor; he values in him, under a wholly different form, an effort that is momentarily, partially fraternal. There are bits of Turner in the work of Poussin, we find a phrase of Flaubert in Montesquieu. Sometimes, again, this rumoured predilection of the Master was due to an error, starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school. But in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time, for if there is an element of free will, some genuine taste expressed in the master\u2019s choice, the schools themselves go only by theory. Thus it is that the mind, following its habitual course which advances by digression, inclining first in one direction, then in the other, had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice, or for a renewal of standards, or the taste of Debussy, or his caprice, or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of Chopin. Commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence, profiting by the admiration that was aroused by Pell\u00e9as, they had acquired a fresh lustre, and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves, albeit preserving the illusion of free will. But Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin spent part of the year in the country. Even in Paris, being an invalid, she was largely confined to her own room. It is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language, a distinction that she did not perceive, for she derived them more from reading than from conversation. The latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions. Unfortunately this revival of the Nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics. The news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the \u2018younger\u2019 people. It remained unknown to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. I gave myself the pleasure of informing her, but by addressing my remark to her mother-in-law, as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion, that Chopin, so far from being out of date, was Debussy\u2019s favourite composer. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s quaint,\u201d said the daughter-in-law with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of Pell\u00e9as. Nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to Chopin with respect and even pleasure. Moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy. Her eyes shone like the eyes of Latude in the play entitled Latude, or Thirty-five Years in Captivity, and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which Beethoven has so well described in Fidelio, at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again \u2018this life-giving air.\u2019 As for the dowager, I thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek. \u201cWhat, you like Chopin? He likes Chopin, he likes Chopin,\u201d she cried with a nasal trumpet-tone of passion; she might have been saying: \u201cWhat, you know Mme. de Franquetot too?\u201d with this difference, that my relations with Mme. de Franquetot would have left her completely indifferent, whereas my knowledge of Chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium. Her salivary super-secretion no longer sufficed. Not having attempted even to understand the part played by Debussy in the rediscovery of Chopin, she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable. Her musical enthusiasm overpowered her. \u201cElodie! Elodie! He likes Chopin!\u201d her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms. \u201cAh! I knew at once that you were a musician,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him. He\u2019s so lovely!\u201d And her voice was as pebbly as if, to express her ardour for Chopin, she had copied Demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach. Then came the turn of the tide, reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm\u2019s way and which was flooded; and lastly the Marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of Chopin had steeped her moustaches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin remarked to me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother-in-law\u2019s cutting it rather fine, she\u2019s forgotten that we\u2019ve got my Uncle de Ch\u2019nouville dining. Besides, Cancan doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d The word \u2018Cancan\u2019 was beyond me, and I supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog. But as for the Ch\u2019nouville relatives, the explanation was as follows. With the lapse of time the young Marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner. And yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband. In other social circles, when one referred to the Chenouville family, the custom was (whenever, that is to say, the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound, for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de, the tongue refusing to utter Madam\u2019 d\u2019Ch\u2019nonceaux) that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed. One said: \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Chenouville.\u201d The Cambremer tradition was different, but no less imperious. It was the mute e of Chenouville that was suppressed. Whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine, it was always de Chenouvilleand never de Chenouville. (Of the father of these Chenouvilles, one said \u2018our Uncle\u2019 for they were not sufficiently \u2018smart set\u2019 at F\u00e9terne to pronounce the word \u2018Unk\u2019 like the Guermantes, whose deliberate jargon, suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words, was as difficult to understand as Old French or a modern dialect.) Every newcomer into the family circle at once received, in the matter of the Ch\u2019nouvilles, a lesson which Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin had not required. When, paying a call one day, she had heard a girl say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d \u201cMy Unk de Rouan,\u201d she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing: Uz\u00e8s, and Rol\u00eean, she had felt the astonishment, embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat. But during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated: \u201cMy Aunt Uzai,\u201d with that suppression of the final s, a suppression that had stupefied her the day before, but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that, one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the Duchesse d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, Mlle. Legrandin had answered her crossly, and in an arrogant tone: \u201cYou might at least pronounce her name properly: Mme. d\u2019Uzai.\u201d From that moment she had realised that, by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements, the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father, the finished education that she had received, her regular attendance at the Sorbonne, whether at Caro\u2019s lectures or at Brunetiere\u2019s, and at the Lamoureux concerts, all this was to be rendered volatile, to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai.\u201d This did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate, in the earlier days, at least, of her married life, not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing, but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say (since that, after all, was why she was marrying): \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d and, when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach, \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt de Ch\u2019nouville,\u201d and \u201cI shall ask you to dine to meet the Uzai.\u201d Her marriage to M. de Cambremer had procured for Mlle. Legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter, the circle in which her parents-in-law moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream. After saying to me of Saint-Loup (adopting for the occasion one of his expressions, for if in talking to her I used those expressions of Legrandin, she by a reverse suggestion answered me in Robert\u2019s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from Rachel), bringing her thumb and forefinger together and half-shutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing: \u201cHe has a charming quality of mind,\u201d she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him (it had indeed been alleged that, some time back, when he was at Don-ci\u00e8res, Robert had been her lover), in reality simply that I might repeat her words to him, and ended up with: \u201cYou are a great friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes. I am an invalid, I never go anywhere, and I know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends, which I do think so wise of her, and so I know her very slightly, but I know she is a really remarkable woman.\u201d Aware that Mme. de Carnbremer barely knew her, and anxious to reduce myself to her level, I avoided the subject and answered the Marquise that the person whom I did know well was her brother, M. Legrandin. At the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of Mme. de Guermantes, but combined with it an expression of annoyance, for she supposed that I had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her. Was she gnawed by despair at having been born a Legrandin? So at least her husband\u2019s sisters and sisters-in-law asserted, ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing, and were jealous of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s intelligence, her education, her fortune, the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness. \u201cShe can think of nothing else, that is what is killing her,\u201d these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of Mme. de Cambremer to no matter whom, but preferably to a plebeian, whether, were he conceited and stupid, to enhance, by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin, the value of the affability that they were shewing him, of, if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself, to give themselves the pleasure, while receiving him hospitably, of insulting him indirectly. But if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sister-in-law, they were mistaken. She suffered not at all from having been born Legrandin, for she had forgotten the fact altogether. She was annoyed at my reminding her of it, and remained silent as though she had not understood, not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit,\u201d said the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, who was probably more satiated than her daughter-in-law with the pleasure to be derived from saying \u2018Ch\u2019nouville.\u2019 \u201cBut, so as not to bother you with too many people, Monsieur,\u201d she went on, indicating the lawyer, \u201cwas afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel. They are waiting for us on the beach, and they will be growing impatient.\u201d I asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them. The wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family, and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye. And as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants, just as on the blemished face of his mother, an identical mole, which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species, protruded below the eye of the son. The lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son. He shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at Balbec. \u201cYou must find yourself rather out of your element, for the people here are for the most part foreigners.\u201d And he kept his eye on me as he spoke, for, not caring for foreigners, albeit he had many foreign clients, he wished to make sure that I was not hostile to his xenophobia, in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying: \u201cOf course, Mme. X\u2014\u2014-may be a charming woman. It\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d As at that time I had no definite opinion about foreigners, I shewed no sign of disapproval; he felt himself to be on safe ground. He went so far as to invite me to come one day, in Paris, to see his collection of Le Sidaner, and to bring with me the Cambremers, with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms. \u201cI shall invite you to meet Le Sidaner,\u201d he said to me, confident that from that moment I would live only in expectation of that happy day. \u201cYou shall see what a delightful man he is. And his pictures will enchant you. Of course, I can\u2019t compete with the great collectors, but I do believe that I am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases. They will interest you all the more, coming from Balbec, since they are marine subjects, for the most part, at least.\u201d The wife and son, blessed with a vegetable nature, listened composedly. One felt that their house in Paris was a sort of temple of Le Sidaner. Temples of this sort are not without their use. When the god has doubts as to his own merits, he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a signal from her daughter-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer prepared to depart, and said to me: \u201cSince you won\u2019t come and stay at F\u00e9terne, won\u2019t you at least come to luncheon, one day this week, to-morrow for instance?\u201d And in her bounty, to make the invitation irresistible, she added: \u201cYou will find the Comte de Crisenoy,\u201d whom I had never lost, for the simple reason that I did not know him. She was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations, but stopped short. The chief magistrate who, on returning to the hotel, had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere, then waited his opportunity, and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance, came up now to greet her. I gathered that Mme. de Cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me. And yet he had known her far longer than I, having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at F\u00e9terne whom I used so to envy during my former visit to Balbec. But old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society. And hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity, especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like Saint-Loup\u2019s of me. Mme. de Cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me, but, to calm her guilty conscience, began addressing him in the kindest tone. In the sunlight that flooded, on the horizon, the golden coastline, invisible as a rule, of Rivebelle, we could just make out, barely distinguishable from the luminous azure, rising from the water, rosy, silvery, faint, the little bells that were sounding the ang\u00e9lus round about F\u00e9terne. \u201cThat is ratherPell\u00e9as, too,\u201d I suggested to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. \u201cYou know the scene I mean.\u201d \u201cOf course I do!\u201d was what she said; but \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea\u201d was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air. The dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far, and rose, reminded of the time. \u201cBut, as a rule,\u201d I said, \u201cwe never see that part of the coast from Balbec, nor hear it either. The weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one. Unless, that is to say, the bells have come to look for you, since I see that they are making you leave; to you they are a dinner bell.\u201d The chief magistrate, little interested in the bells, glanced furtively along the front, on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening. \u201cYou are a true poet,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to me. \u201cOne feels you are so responsive, so artistic, come, I will play you Chopin,\u201d she went on, raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach. Then came the deglutition of spittle, and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief. The chief magistrate did me, unconsciously, a great service by offering the Marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage, a certain blend of vulgarity, boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk, and which are by no means unsuccessful in society. He was, moreover, and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself. While blessing him for what he did I did not venture to copy him, and walked by the side of Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that I had in my hand. The name of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 drew a grimace from her; and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers, but which, used in speech and given a feminine form, and applied to a seventeenth century writer, had an odd effect, she asked me: \u201cDo you think her really masterly?\u201d The Marquise gave her footman the address of a pastry-cook where she had to call before taking the road, rosy with the evening haze, through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff. She asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough, whether the other\u2019s shoe were not hurting him. \u201cI shall write to you and make a definite engagement,\u201d she murmured to me. \u201cI heard you talking about literature to my daughter-in-law, she\u2019s a darling,\u201d she went on, not that she really thought so, but she had acquired the habit \u2014 and kept it up in her kindness of heart \u2014 of saying so, in order that her son might not appear to have married for money. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth, \u201cshe\u2019s so harttissttick!\u201d With this she stepped into her carriage, nodding her head, holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier, and set off through the streets of Balbec, overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood, like an old Bishop on a confirmation tour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has asked you to luncheon,\u201d the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and I came indoors with the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the best of terms just now. She feels that I neglect her. Gad, I\u2019m easy enough to get on with. If anybody needs me, I\u2019m always there to say: Adsum! But they tried to force my hand. That, now,\u201d he went on with an air of subtlety, holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction, \u201cthat is a thing I do not allow. It is a threat to the liberty of my holidays. I was obliged to say: Stopl You seem to be in her good books. When you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing, and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles. Well, I am going to take a turn before dinner. Good-bye, children,\u201d he shouted back at us, as though he were already fifty yards away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had said good-bye to Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, they saw with astonishment that Albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them. \u201cWhy, Albertine, what are you doing, don\u2019t you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cGo home,\u201d she replied in a tone of authority. \u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d she added, indicating myself with a submissive air. Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le stared at me, filled with a new and strange respect. I enjoyed the feeling that, for a moment at least, in the eyes even of Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, I was to Albertine something more important than the time, than her friends, and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted. \u201cShan\u2019t we see you again this evening?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it will depend on this person. Anyhow, to-morrow.\u201d \u201cLet us go up to my room,\u201d I said to her, when her friends had gone. We took the lift; she remained silent in the boy\u2019s presence. The habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters, those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them, develops in \u2018employees\u2019 (as the lift-boy styled servants), a stronger power of divination than the \u2018employer\u2019 possesses. Our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle, accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes. Since railways came into existence, the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives, the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed. And so the lift-boy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that Albertine and I were preoccupied. But he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact. And yet I could see upon his face, in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift, an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness. As I knew nothing of the cause of this, in an attempt to distract his thoughts, and albeit I was more preoccupied than Albertine, I told him that the lady who had just left was called the Marquise de Cambremer and not de Camembert. On the landing at which we were pausing at the moment, I saw, carrying a pair of pails, a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect, hoping for a tip when I left. I should have liked to know if she were the one whom I had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at Balbec, but I could never arrive at any certainty. The lift-boy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses, but without shedding his expression of despair, that it was indeed by the name of Camembert that the Marquise had told him to announce her. And as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew. Besides, having those very vague ideas of nobility, and of the names of which titles are composed, which are shared by many people who are not lift-boys, the name Camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as, that cheese being universally known, it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction, unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese. Nevertheless as he saw that I refused to admit that I might be mistaken, and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted, he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say Cambremer. It is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town, none of the peasants in the district, where the name and persons of the Cambremers were perfectly familiar, could ever have made the lift-boy\u2019s mistake. But the staff of the \u2018Grand Hotel of Balbec\u2019 were none of them natives. They came direct, with the furniture and stock, from Biarritz, Nice and Monte-Carlo, one division having been transferred to Deauville, another to Dinard and the third reserved for Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the lift-boy\u2019s pained anxiety continued to grow. That he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles, some misfortune must have befallen him. Perhaps he had been \u2018\u2018missed.\u2019 I made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement, the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff. \u201cYou can always do just what you like, I rectify everything in advance.\u201d Suddenly, as I stepped out of the lift, I guessed the meaning of the boy\u2019s distress, his panic-stricken air. Because Albertine was with me, I had not given him the five francs which I was in the habit of slipping into his hand when I went up. And the idiot, instead of understanding that I did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person, had begun to tremble, supposing that it was all finished, that I would never give him anything again. He imagined that I was \u2018on the rocks\u2019 (as the Duc de Guermantes would have said), and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment. I told myself that I was less unreasonable than my mother thought when I dared not, one day, refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that I had given the day before. But at the same time the meaning that I had until then, and without a shadow of doubt, ascribed to his habitual expression of joy, in which I had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion, seemed to me to have become less certain. Seeing the lift-boy ready, in his despair, to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel, I asked myself whether, if our respective social stations were to be altered, in consequence let us say of a revolution, instead of politely working his lift for me, the boy, grown independent, would not have flung me down the well, and whether there was not, in certain of the lower orders, more duplicity than in society, where, no doubt, people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot, but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One cannot however say that, in the Balbec hotel, the lift-boy was the most commercially minded. From this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories; on the one hand, those who drew distinctions between the visitors, and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman (who, moreover, was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to General de Beautreillis) than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity. On the other hand, those to whom nobility, intellect, fame, position, manners were nonexistent, concealed under a cash valuation. For these there was but a single standard, the money one has, or rather the money one bestows. Possibly Aim\u00e9 himself, albeit pretending, in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served, to a great knowledge of the world, belonged to this latter category. At the most he would give a social turn, shewing that he knew who was who, to this sort of appreciation, as when he said of the Princesse de Luxembourg: \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of money among that lot?\u201d (the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained, before supplying a client with a \u2018chef for Paris, or promising him a table on the left, by the door, with a view of the sea, at Balbec). In spite of this, and albeit not free from sordid considerations, he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the lift-boy. And yet, the latter\u2019s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things. It is the convenience of a big hotel, of a house such as Rachel used at one time to frequent, that, without any intermediary, the face, frozen stiff until that moment, of a servant or a woman, at the sight of a hundred-franc note, still more of one of a thousand, even although it is being given to some one else, will melt in smiles and offers of service. Whereas in the dealings, in the relations between lover and mistress, there are too many things interposed between money and docility. So many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together, believe themselves to be, and indeed are more refined. Besides, it rids polite conversation of such speeches as: \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left for me to do, you will find me to-morrow in the mortuary.\u201d And so one meets in polite society few novelists, or poets, few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor, Albertine began: \u201cWhat is it, you have got against me?\u201d Had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself? Had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part, with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her, and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that I had long since formed about her was correct? However that may be, when I heard her question, I suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal. Before answering her, I escorted her to the door of my room. Opening it, I scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask. I went across to the window; the gulls had settled again upon the waves; but this time they were pink. I drew Albertine\u2019s attention to them. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she said, \u201cbe frank with me.\u201d I lied. I declared to her that she must first listen to a confession, that of my passionate admiration, for some time past, of Andr\u00e9e, and I made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage, but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel. Harking back to the fiction I had employed with Gilberte before my first visit to Balbec, but adapting its terms, I went so far (in order to make her more ready to believe me when I told her now that I was not in love with her) as to let fall the admission that at one time I had been on the point of falling in love with her, but that too long an interval had elapsed, that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade, and that even if I wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power. As it happened, in taking my stand thus before Albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her, I was merely \u2014 because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view \u2014 making more perceptible, accentuating more markedly, that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them, and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her. They know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes, the same agonies, invented the same romances, uttered the same words, to have deduced therefore that their sentiments, their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love, but pass by her, spatter her, surround her, like the waves that break round upon the rocks, and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman, by whom they would so fain be loved, is not in love with them. Why should chance have brought it about, when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire, that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her? And so, while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments, so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us, those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover\u2019s, after we have taken a step forward, in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her, our hopes, overcome at once by the fear of offending her, ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her, that it has served us already, will serve us again for others, that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste, of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them, this fear, this shame bring into play the counter-rhythm, the reflux, the need, even by first drawing back, hotly denying the affection we have already confessed, to resume the offensive, and to recapture her esteem, to dominate her; the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair, in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs, in all those people whose self-analysis outweighs their self-esteem. If it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which I was now preparing to make to Albertine, that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though it must be painful to Albertine to believe what I was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again, after so long an interval, I justified what I called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom I had, by their fault or my own, allowed the time for loving them to pass, and been unable, however keenly I might have desired it, to recapture it. I thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her, as for a want of courtesy, for this inability to begin loving her again, and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself. But by explaining myself in this fashion, by dwelling upon the case of Gilberte, in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to Albertine, all that I did was to render my assertions as plausible as I pretended to believe that they were not. Feeling that Albertine appreciated what she called my \u2018frank speech\u2019 and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence, I apologised for the former by telling her that I knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible. She, on the contrary, thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This avowal to Albertine of an imaginary sentiment for Andr\u00e9e, and, towards herself, an indifference which, that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration, I assured her incidentally, as though by a scruple of politeness, must not be taken too literally, enabled me at length, without any fear of Albertine\u2019s suspecting me of loving her, to speak to her with a tenderness which I had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite. I almost caressed my confidant; as I spoke to her of her friend whom I loved, tears came to my eyes. But, coming at last to the point, I said to her that she knew what love meant, its susceptibilities, its sufferings, and that perhaps, as the old friend that she now was, she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me, not directly, since it was not herself that I loved, if I might venture to repeat that without offending her, but indirectly by wounding me in my love for Andr\u00e9e. I broke off to admire and point out to Albertine a great bird, solitary and hastening, which far out in front of us, lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings, was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper, and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace, without diverting its attention, without deviating from its path, like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message. \u201cHe at least goes straight to the point!\u201d said Albertine in a tone of reproach. \u201cYou say that because you don\u2019t know what it is I was going to tell you. But it is so difficult that I prefer to give it up; I am certain that I should make you angry; and then all that will have happened will be this: I shall be in no way better off with the girl I really love and I shall have lost a good friend.\u201d \u201cBut when I swear to you that I will not be angry.\u201d She had so sweet, so wistfully docile an air, as though her whole happiness depended on me, that I could barely restrain myself from kissing \u2014 with almost the same kind of pleasure that I should have taken in kissing my mother \u2014 this novel face which no longer presented the startled, blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink, tip-tilted nose, but seemed, in the fulness of its crushing sorrow, moulded in broad, flattened, drooping slabs of pure goodness. Making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her, putting myself in her place, I let my heart be melted before this honest girl, accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion, whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point. It was because I placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human, external to both of us, at which my jealous love dissolved, that I felt for Albertine that profound pity, which would have been less profound if I had not loved her. However, in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel (the surest, the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm), of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity, which, the opposite of love, though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause, produces in every case the same effects? When we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman, we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her, to make her love us, to win her favours, bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love, from a mere sense of moral duty, as though we were not in love with her. \u201cBut tell me, what on earth have I done?\u201d Albertine asked me. There was a knock at the door; it was the lift-boy; Albertine\u2019s aunt, who was passing the hotel in a carriage, had stopped on the chance of finding her there, to take her home. Albertine sent word that she could not come, that they were to begin dinner without her, that she could not say at what time she would return. \u201cBut won\u2019t your aunt be angry?\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose? She will understand all right.\u201d And so, at this moment at least, a moment such as might never occur again \u2014 a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in Albertine\u2019s eyes a thing of such self-evident importance that it must be given precedence over everything, a thing to which, referring no doubt instinctively to a family code, enumerating certain crises in which, when the career of M. Bontemps was at stake, a journey had been made without a thought, my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinner-hour. That remote hour which she passed without my company, among her own people, Albertine, having brought it to me, bestowed it on me; I might make what use of it I chose. I ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living, and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that I felt for women tainted with that vice, I had not given it a thought until I had been told the name of her accomplice, and that she could readily understand, loving Andr\u00e9e as I did, the grief that, the news had caused me. It would have been more tactful perhaps to say that I had been given the names of other women as well, in whom I was not interested. But the sudden and terrible revelation that Cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it, complete in itself but without accretions. And just as, before that moment, it would never have occurred to me that Albertine was in love with Andr\u00e9e, or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her, if Cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together, so I had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea, so different for me, that Albertine might have, with other women than Andr\u00e9e, relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse. Albertine, before even swearing to me that it was not true, shewed, like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him, anger, concern, and, with regard to the unknown slanderer, a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him. But she assured me that she bore me, at least, no resentment. \u201cIf it had been true, I should have told you. But Andr\u00e9e and I both loathe that sort of thing. We have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean, and nothing revolts us more.\u201d Albertine gave me merely her word, a peremptory word unsupported by proof. But this was just what was best calculated to calm me, jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation. It is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous, to make us suspect, more readily than we should suspect anyone else, her whom we love, and be convinced more easily by her denials. We must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous, which is to say before we can be aware of the fact, and we must be in love too before we can hope, that is to say assure ourselves that some are. It is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it. The statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true, we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts. Besides, however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love, she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours, or as turning her desires in another direction. The former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other, the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us. The beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it. No doubt, I had long since been prepared, by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of Swann, to believe in the truth of what I feared rather than of what I should have wished. And so the comfort brought me by Albertine\u2019s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment, because I was reminded of the story of Odette. But I told myself that, if it was only right to allow for the worst, not only when, in order to understand Swann\u2019s sufferings, I had tried to put myself in his place, but now, when I myself was concerned, in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else, still I must not, out of cruelty to myself, a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed, end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest, simply because it was more painful. Was there not a vast gulf between Albertine, a girl of good, middle-class parentage, and Odette, a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood? There could be no comparison of their respective credibility. Besides, Albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that Odette had had in lying to Swann. Moreover to him Odette had admitted what Albertine had just denied. I should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious \u2014 though in the opposite direction \u2014 as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest, were I not to take into account these material differences in their positions, but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what I had been told about the life of Odette. I had before me a new Albertine, of whom I had already, it was true, caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to Balbec, frank and honest, an Albertine who had, out of affection for myself, forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them. She made me sit down by her side upon my bed. I thanked her for what she had said to me, assured her that our reconciliation was complete, and that I would never be horrid to her again. I suggested to her that she ought, at the same time, to go home to dinner. She asked me whether I was not glad to have her with me. Drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which I owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture, she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart. At first I kept them tight shut. \u201cYou are a great bear!\u201d she informed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again. I felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated \u2014 I might as well say, in love, for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love \u2014 we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman\u2019s good nature, or her caprice, or mere chance, bring to our desires, in perfect coincidence, the same words, the same actions as if we were really loved. The wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity, to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which I should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured; to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me, and \u2014 lest the next day should expose this fiction \u2014 not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this, which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment. I ought to have left Balbec, to have shut myself up in solitude, to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which I had contrived to render amorous for an instant, and of which I should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me; for fear lest, by an additional word which now could only be different, it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which, as though by the pressure of a pedal, there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soothed by my explanation with Albertine, I began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother. She loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger. Fearing that I might reproach myself with the sorrows with which I had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother\u2019s life, she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me. We talked of the old days at Combray. My mother reminded me that there at least I used to read, and that at Balbec I might well do the same, if I was not going to work. I replied that, to surround myself with memories of Combray and of the charming coloured plates, I should like to read again the Thousand and One Nights. As, long ago at Combray, when she gave me books for my birthday, so it was in secret, as a surprise for me, that my mother now sent for both the Thousand and One Nights of Galland and the Thousand Nights and a Night of Mardrus. But, after casting her eye over the two translations, my mother would have preferred that I should stick to Galland\u2019s, albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty, her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that, being a woman, on the one hand she lacked, or so she thought, the necessary literary equipment, and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man. Happening upon certain of the tales, she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression. But above all, preserving, like precious relics, not only the brooch, the sunshade, the cloak, the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother, seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed, my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned Mardrus\u2019s book. She remembered that at Combray while before setting out for a walk, M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was reading Augustin Thierry, my grandmother, glad that I should be reading, and taking walks, was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich: \u2018Then reign\u00e8d M\u00e9rov\u00e9e\u2019 called Merowig, refused to say \u2018Carolingians\u2019 for the \u2018Carlovingians\u2019 to which she remained loyal. And then I told her what my grandmother had thought of the Greek names which Bloch, following Leconte de Lisle, gave to the gods of Homer, going so far, in the simplest matters, as to make it a religious duty, in which he supposed literary talent to consist, to adopt a Greek system of spelling. Having occasion, for instance, to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar, he would write \u2018real nektar,\u2019 with a k, which enabled him to titter at the mention of Lamartine. And if an Odyssey from which the names of Ulysses and Minerva were missing was no longer the Odyssey to her, what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her Thousand and One Nights, upon no longer finding, exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them, the immortally familiar names of Scheherazade, of Dinarzade, in which, debaptised themselves (if one may use the expression of Musulman tales), the charming Caliph and the powerful Genies were barely recognisable, being renamed, he the \u2018Khalifat\u2019 and they the \u2018Gennis.\u2019 Still, my mother handed over both books to me, and I told her that I would read them on the days when I. felt too tired to go out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days were not very frequent, however. We used to go out picnicking as before in a band, Albertine, her friends and myself, on the cliff or to the farm called Marie-Antoinette. But there were times when Albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure. She would say to me: \u201cTo-day I want to be alone with you for a little, it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves.\u201d Then she would give out that she was busy, not that she need furnish any explanation, and so that the others, if they went all the same, without us, for an excursion and picnic, might not be able to find us, we would steal away like a pair of lovers, all by ourselves to Bagatelle or the Cross of Heulan, while the band, who would never think of looking for us there and never went there, waited indefinitely, in the hope of seeing us appear, at Marie-Antoinette. I recall the hot weather that we had then, when from the brow of each of the farm-labourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall, vertical, regular, intermittent, like the drop of water from a cistern, and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining \u2018closes\u2019; they have remained, to this day, with that mystery of a woman\u2019s secret, the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me. A woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom I would not give a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 I upset all my week\u2019s engagements to make her acquaintance, if it is a week of similar weather, and I am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse. It is no good my knowing that this kind of weather, this kind of assignation are not part of her, they are still the bait, which I know all too well, by which I allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me. I know that this woman, in cold weather, in a town, I might perhaps have desired, but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment, without becoming amorous; my love for her is none the less keen as soon as, by force of circumstances, it has enthralled me \u2014 it is only the more melancholy, as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become, in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent, cut short in the same moment as life itself, will be the last\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were still but a few people at Balbec, hardly any girls. Sometimes I saw some girl resting upon the beach, devoid of charm, and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom I had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium. If it was the same (and I took care not to mention the matter to Albertine), then the girl that I had thought so exciting did not exist. But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach, did not offer a permanent form, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own observation, the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was self-sufficient, by the different clothes that she was wearing, the rapidity of her movements or her immobility. All the same, two or three of them seemed to me adorable. Whenever I saw one of these, I longed to take her away along the Avenue des Tamaris, or among the sandhills, better still upon the cliff. But, albeit into desire, as opposed to indifference, there enters already that audacity which is a first stage, if only unilateral, towards realisation, all the same, between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been, there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation, of timidity. Then I went into the pastrycook\u2019s bar, I drank, one after another, seven or eight glasses of port wine. At once, instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action, the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together. No longer was there any room for hesitation or fear. It seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms. I went up to her, the words came spontaneously to my lips: \u201cI should like to go for a walk with you. You wouldn\u2019t care to go along the cliff, we shan\u2019t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now?\u201d All the difficulties of life were smoothed away, there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies. No obstacle for me, at least. For they had not been volatilised for her, who had not been drinking port wine. Had she done so, had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes, the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet \u2018the season\u2019 they stayed but a short time. There is one I remember with a reddish skin, green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks, whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees. I cannot say what breeze wafted her to Balbec or what other bore her away. So sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards I was haunted by a grief which I made bold to confess to Albertine when I realised that the girl had gone for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that several of them were either girls whom I did not know at all or whom I had not seen for years. Often, before addressing them, I wrote to them. If their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love, what joy! We cannot, at the outset of our friendship with a woman, even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing, bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her. We like to have them beside us all the time, like a present of rare flowers, still quite fresh, at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them. The sentence that we know by heart, it is pleasant to read again, and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression. Did she write: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019? A slight marring of our bliss, which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly, or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent; she did not say: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019 but \u2018From your letter.\u2019 But the rest is so tender. Oh, that more such flowers may come to-morrow. Then that is no longer enough, we must with the written words compare the writer\u2019s eyes, her face. We make an appointment, and \u2014 without her having altered, perhaps \u2014 whereas we expected, from the description given us or our personal memory, to meet the fairy Viviane, we encounter Puss-in-Boots. We make an appointment, nevertheless, for the following day, for it is, after all, she, and the person we desired is she. And these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential. These desires are only the desire for a certain person; vague as perfumes, as styrax was the desire of Prothyraia, saffron the ethereal desire, aromatic scents the desire of Hera, myrrh the perfume of the Magi, manna the desire of Nike, incense the perfume of the sea. But these perfumes that are sung in the Orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship. Myrrh is the perfume of the Magi, but also of Protogonos, Neptune, Nereus, Leto; incense is the perfume of the sea, but also of the fair Dike, of Themis, of Circe, of the Nine Muses, of Eos, of Mnemosyne, of the Day, of Dikaiosyne. As for styrax, manna and aromatic scents, it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them, so many are they. Amphietes has all the perfumes except incense, and Gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents. So was it with these desires for different girls that I felt. Fewer in number than the girls themselves, they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another. I never wished for myrrh. I reserved it for Jupien and for the Prince de Guermantes, for it is the desire of Protogonos \u201cof twofold sex, who roars like a bull, of countless orgies, memorable, unspeakable, descending, joyous, to the sacrifices of the Orgiophants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the season was in full swing; every day there was some fresh arrival, and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings, which took the place of the charmed perusal of the Thousand and One Nights, there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all. The beach was now peopled with girls, and, since the idea suggested to me by Cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind, as soon as a young woman arrived at Balbec, I began to feel ill at ease, I proposed to Albertine the most distant excursions, in order that she might not make the newcomer\u2019s acquaintance, and indeed, if possible, might not set eyes on her. I dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known; I tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation, was a slander, perhaps, without admitting it to myself, from a fear, still unconscious, that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so, because of me, or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned. In denying the guilt of each of them, my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist. Albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s just a pose, she wants to look the part.\u201d But then, I regretted almost that I had pleaded the other\u2019s innocence, for it distressed me that Albertine, formerly so severe, could believe that this \u2018part\u2019 was a thing so flattering, so advantageous, that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to \u2018look it.\u2019 I would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to Balbec; I trembled when I thought that, as it was almost time for Mme. Putbus to arrive at the Verdurins\u2019, her maid, whose tastes Saint-Loup had not concealed from me, might take it into her head to come down to the beach, and, if it were a day on which I was not with Albertine, might seek to corrupt her. I went the length of asking myself whether, as Cottard had made no secret of the fact that the Verdurins thought highly of me and, while not wishing to appear, as he put it, to be running after me, would give a great deal to have me come to their house, I might not, on the strength of promises to bring all the Guermantes in existence to call on them in Paris, induce Mme. Verdurin, upon some pretext or other, to inform Mme. Putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once. Notwithstanding these thoughts, and as it was chiefly the presence of Andr\u00e9e that was disturbing me, the soothing effect that Albertine\u2019s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted \u2014 I knew moreover that presently I should have less need of it, as Andr\u00e9e would be leaving the place with Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with Albertine. During these weeks, moreover, Albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did, everything that she said, with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained, or to prevent them from reviving. She contrived never to be left alone with Andr\u00e9e, and insisted, when we came back from an excursion, upon my accompanying her to her door, upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere. Andr\u00e9e meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side, seemed to avoid meeting Albertine. And this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that Albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time there occurred at the Grand Hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment. Bloch\u2019s cousin had for some time past been indulging, with a retired actress, in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them. That they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure, they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world. They began with caresses, which might, after all, be set down to a friendly intimacy, in the card-room, by the baccarat-table. Then they grew more bold. And finally, one evening, in a corner that was not even dark of the big ball-room, on a sofa, they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed. Two officers who happened to be near, with their wives, complained to the manager. It was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective. But they had this against them that, having come over for the evening from Netteholme, where they were staying, they could not be of any use to the manager. Whereas, without her knowing it even, and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her, there hovered over Mlle. Bloch the protection of M. Nissim Bernard. I must explain why. M. Nissim Bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues. Every year he took a magnificent villa at Balbec for his nephew, and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table, which was in reality theirs. But he never took his luncheon at home. Every day at noon he was at the Grand Hotel. The fact of the matter was that he was keeping, as other men keep a chorus-girl from the opera, an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken, and who made us think of the young Israelites inEsther and Athalie. It is true that the forty years\u2019 difference in age between M. Nis-sim Bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant. But, as Racine so wisely observes in those same choruses:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great God, with what uncertain tread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A budding virtue \u2018mid such perils goes!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What stumbling-blocks do lie before a soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seeks Thee and would fain be innocent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young waiter might indeed have been brought up \u2018remote from the world\u2019 in the Temple-Caravanserai of Balbec, he had not followed the advice of Joad:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In riches and in gold put not thy trust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had perhaps justified himself by saying: \u201cThe wicked cover the earth.\u201d However that might be, and albeit M. Nissim Bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest, on the very first day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were\u2019t in alarm, or anxious to caress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt those childish arms about him thrown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the second day, M. Nissim Bernard having taken the young waiter out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dire assault his innocence destroyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment the boy\u2019s life was altered. He might indeed carry bread and salt, as his superior bade him, his whole face sang:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From flowers to flowers, from joys to keener joys\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let our desires now range\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncertain is our tale of fleeting years\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haste we then to enjoy this life!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honours and fame are the reward\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of blind and meek obedience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For moping innocence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now would raise his voice!\n\nSince that day, M. Nissim Bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheon-table (as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer, a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type, which still awaits its Degas). It was M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned, the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service, in the service of everyone, and, less than anyone, of M. Nissim Bernard, now that the latter was keeping him, whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved, or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest, if discovered, it might make him lose other opportunities. But this very coldness pleased M. Nissim Bernard, because of all that it concealed; whether from Hebraic atavism or from profanation of the Christian spirit, he took a singular pleasure, were it Jewish or Catholic, in the Racinian ceremony. Had it been a real performance of Esther or Athalie, M. Bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author, Jean Racine, so that he might obtain for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a more substantial part. But as the luncheon ceremony came from no author\u2019s pen, he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and Aim\u00e9, so that the \u2018young Israelite\u2019 might be promoted to the coveted post of under-waiter, or even full waiter to a row of tables. The post of wine waiter had been offered him. But M. Bernard made him decline it, for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green dining-room and to be waited upon by him like a stranger. Now this pleasure was so keen that every year M. Bernard returned to Balbec and took his luncheon away from home, habits in which M. Bloch saw, in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine, the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others, in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the mistake made by M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s relatives, who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to Balbec and for what the pedantic Mme. Bloch called his absentee palate, was really a more profound and secondary truth. For M. Nissim Bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at Balbec, for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea, and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping, like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a Degas, one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls. And so M. Nissim Bernard maintained, with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at Balbec, and with the stage-manager and producer Aim\u00e9\u2014 whose part in all this affair was anything but simple \u2014 excellent relations. One day they would intrigue to procure an important part, a place perhaps as headwaiter. In the meantime M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s pleasure, poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be, reminded one a little of those women-loving men who always know \u2014 Swann, for example, in the past \u2014 that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress. No sooner had M. Nissim Bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene, bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray. And so every morning, after kissing his niece, bothering my friend Bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand, he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the Grand Hotel. Had the house been on fire, had his niece had a stroke, he would doubtless have started off just the same. So that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed \u2014 for he was a hypochondriac \u2014 and would oblige him to ask Aim\u00e9 to send his young friend across to visit him at home, between luncheon and tea-time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors, private offices, reception-rooms, cloakrooms, larders, galleries which composed the hotel at Balbec. With a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio, and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages. While, venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal, M. Nissim Bernard, in his quest of the young L\u00e9vites, put one in mind of those lines in La Juive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O God of our Fathers, come down to us again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to Balbec, as her maids, with an old lady, a foreigner. They were what the language of hotels called \u2018couriers,\u2019 and that of Fran\u00e7oise, who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course, two \u2018coursers.\u2019 The hotels have remained, more nobly, in the period when people sang: \u201cC\u2019est un courrier de cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants\u2019 quarters, I had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship, as strong as it was pure, with these two young persons, Mademoiselle Marie Gineste and Madame C\u00e9leste Albaret. Born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of France, on the banks of rivulets and torrents (the water passed actually under their old home, turning a millwheel, and the house had often been damaged by floods), they seemed to embody the features of that region. Marie Gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt, C\u00e9leste Albaret softer and more languishing, spread out like a lake, but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them. They often came in the morning to see me when I was still in bed. I have never known people so deliberately ignorant, who had learned absolutely nothing at school, and yet whose language was somehow so literary that, but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone, one would have thought their speech affected. With a familiarity which I reproduce verbatim, notwithstanding the praises (which I set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of C\u00e9leste) and the criticisms, equally unfounded, in which her remarks seem to involve me, while I dipped crescent rolls in my milk, C\u00e9leste would say to me: \u201cOh! Little black devil with hair of jet, O profound wickedness! I don\u2019t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you, for you are just like a bird. Look, Marie, wouldn\u2019t you say he was preening his feathers, and turning his head right round, so light he looks, you would say he was just learning to fly. Ah! It\u2019s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches; what would ever have become of you, so wasteful as you are. Look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed. There he goes, now, look, he\u2019s spilling his milk, wait till I tie a napkin round you, for you could never do it for yourself, never in my life have I seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you.\u201d I would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of Marie Gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister: \u201cWill you hold your tongue, now, C\u00e9leste. Are you mad, talking to Monsieur like that?\u201d C\u00e9leste merely smiled; and as I detested having a napkin tied round my neck: \u201cNo, Marie, look at him, bang, he\u2019s shot straight up on end like a serpent. A proper serpent, I tell you.\u201d These were but a few of her zoological similes, for, according to her, it was impossible to tell when I slept, I fluttered about all night like a butterfly, and in the day time I was as swift as the squirrels. \u201cYou know, Marie, the way we see them at home, so nimble that even with your eyes you can\u2019t follow them.\u201d \u201cBut, C\u00e9leste, you know he doesn\u2019t like having a napkin when he\u2019s eating.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will. He\u2019s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is. They can change the sheets ten times over, if they must, but he won\u2019t give way. Yesterday\u2019s had served their time, but to-day they have only just been put on the bed and they\u2019ll have to be changed already. Oh, I was right when I said that he was never meant to be born among the poor. Look, his hair\u2019s standing on end, swelling with rage like a bird\u2019s feathers. Poor ploumissou!\u201d Here it was not only Marie that protested, but myself, for I did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman. But C\u00e9leste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short. \u201cOh! The story-teller! Oh! The flatterer! Oh! The false one! The cunning rogue! Oh! Moli\u00e8re!\u201d (This was the only writer\u2019s name that she knew, but she applied it to me, meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them.) \u201cC\u00e9leste!\u201d came the imperious cry from Marie, who, not knowing the name of Moli\u00e8re, was afraid that it might be some fresh insult. C\u00e9leste continued to smile: \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen the photograph of him in his drawer, when he was little. He tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply. And there, with his little cane, he\u2019s all furs and laces, such as no Prince ever wore. But that\u2019s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d scolded the torrent Marie, \u201cyou go rummaging in his drawers now, do you?\u201d To calm Marie\u2019s fears I asked her what she thought of M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s behaviour. . . . \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are things I wouldn\u2019t have believed could exist. One has to come here to learn.\u201d And, for once outrivalling C\u00e9leste by an even more profound observation: \u201cAh! You see, Monsieur, one can never tell what there may be in a person\u2019s life.\u201d To change the subject, I spoke to her of the life led by my father, who toiled night and day. \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves, not one minute, not one pleasure, the whole thing is a sacrifice for others, they are lives that are given away.\u201d \u201cLook, Marie, he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent, what distinction. He can do the most insignificant things, you would say that the whole nobility of France, from here to the Pyrenees, was stirring in each of his movements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike, I remained silent; C\u00e9leste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile: \u201cOh! Brow that looks so pure, and hides so many things, nice, cool cheeks like the inside of an almond, little hands of satin all velvety, nails like claws,\u201d and so forth. \u201cThere, Marie, look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers. What a serious air! They ought really to take his portrait as he is just now. He\u2019s just like a child. Is it drinking milk, like them, that has kept you their bright colour? Oh! Youth! Oh! Lovely skin. You will never grow old. You are a lucky one, you will never need to raise your hand against anyone, for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done. Look at him now, he\u2019s angry. He shoots up, straight as a sign-post.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise did not at all approve of what she called the two \u2018tricksters\u2019 coming to talk to me like this. The manager, who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on, even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants. I, who found the \u2018tricksters\u2019 far better than any visitor in the hotel, merely laughed in his face, convinced that he would not understand my explanations. And the sisters returned. \u201cLook, Marie, at his delicate lines. Oh, perfect miniature, finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case, for he can move, and utters words you could listen to for days and nights.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there, for, without knowing anything of history or geography, they heartily detested the English, the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, all foreign vermin, and cared, with certain exceptions, for French people alone. Their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds, that, as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel, in order to repeat what he had said, C\u00e9leste and Marie imposed upon their faces his face, their mouths became his mouth, their eyes his eyes, one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks. C\u00e9leste indeed, while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said, or one of my friends, would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of Bloch, the chief magistrate, etc., while apparently unconscious of doing so. It was, under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey, an inimitable portrait. They never read anything, not even a newspaper. One day, however, they found lying on my bed a book. It was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of Saint-L\u00e9ger L\u00e9ger. C\u00e9leste read a few pages and said to me: \u201cBut are you quite sure that these are poetry, wouldn\u2019t they just be riddles?\u201d Obviously, to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem: \u201cDown here the lilacs die,\u201d there was a gap in evolution. I fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home. They had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew. For if C\u00e9leste had said something noteworthy and, unable to remember it correctly, I asked her to repeat it, she would assure me that she had forgotten. They will never read any books, but neither will they ever write any\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married, one the niece of the Archbishop of Tours, the other a relative of the Bishop of Rodez. To the manager, this would have conveyed nothing. C\u00e9leste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her, and as for me, I was astonished that he could endure her. For at certain moments, raging, furious, destroying everything, she was detestable. It is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element. Similarly, I believe that C\u00e9leste, not only in her bursts of fury, but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams. When she was exhausted, it was after their fashion; she had literally run dry. Nothing could then have revived her. Then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body, splendid and light. The water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin. She smiled at the sun and became bluer still. At such moments she was truly celestial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor, due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress; everything that concerned M. Nissim Bernard was tabu to the manager of the Balbec hotel. And that was why, without even referring to the uncle, he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece, albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect. And so the girl and her friend who, for some days, had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the Grand Hotel, seeing that everything was settled, were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties. No doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody. But gradually they returned to their old ways. And one evening as I came out of the casino which was half in darkness with Albertine and Bloch whom we had met there, they came towards us, linked together, kissing each other incessantly, and, as they passed us, crowed and laughed, uttering indecent cries. Bloch lowered his eyes, so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin, and as for myself I was tortured by the thought that this occult, appalling language was addressed perhaps to Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of Gomorrah. I had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman, erect and pale, whose eyes, round their centre, scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded, on meeting her gaze, of some constellation. I thought how much more beautiful this girl was than Albertine, and that it would be wiser to give up the other. Only, the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life, of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients, so much so that her eyes, more noble however than the rest of her face, could radiate nothing but appetites and desires. Well, on the following day, this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino, I saw that she never ceased to fasten upon Albertine the alternate, circling fires of her gaze. One would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse. I dreaded my friend\u2019s seeing that she was being so closely observed, I was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow. For all I knew, this assignation might not be the first. The young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to Balbec. It was perhaps because Albertine had already yielded to her desires, or to those of a friend, that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals. If so, they did more than demand something for the present, they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This assignation, in that case, must be not the first, but the sequel to adventures shared in past years. And indeed her glance did not say: \u201cWill you?\u201d As soon as the young woman had caught sight of Albertine, she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection, as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember. Albertine, who could see her plainly, remained phlegmatically motionless, with the result that the other, with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover, ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, a day or two later, I received a proof of this young woman\u2019s tendencies, and also of the probability of her having known Albertine in the past. Often, in the hall of the casino, when two girls were smitten with mutual desire, a luminous phenomenon occurred, a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other. Let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations, even if they be imponderable, by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere, that the scattered Gomorrah tends, in every town, in every village, to reunite its separated members, to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made, be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction, by the nostalgic, the hypocritical, sometimes by the courageous exiles from Sodom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once I saw the stranger whom Albertine had appeared not to recognise, just at the moment when Bloch\u2019s cousin was approaching her. The young woman\u2019s eyes flashed, but it was quite evident that she did not know the Israelite maiden. She beheld her for the first time, felt a desire, a shadow of doubt, by no means the same certainty as in the case of Albertine, Albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that, in the face of her coldness, she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with Paris but not resident there, who, having returned to spend a few weeks there, on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings, sees that they have now built a bank\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine. Presently the young woman came and sat down, with an abstracted air, by her side. But under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling, then their legs and hands, in a confused heap. Words followed, a conversation began, and the young woman\u2019s innocent husband, who had been looking everywhere for her, was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know. His wife introduced Bloch\u2019s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood, by an inaudible name, for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was. But the husband\u2019s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther, for they addressed each other as tu, having known each other at their convent, an incident at which they laughed heartily later on, as well as at the hoodwinked husband, with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Albertine, I cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free. I found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding, to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion. When questioned by some girl, she had a quick, icy, decent way of replying in a very loud voice: \u201cYes, I shall be going to the tennis court about five. I shall bathe to-morrow morning about eight,\u201d and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this \u2014 all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent, and either to make an assignation, or, the assignation already made in a whisper, to utter this speech, harmless enough in itself, aloud, so as not to attract attention. And when later on I saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance, I could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motor-car at the end of the beach, Albertine could not help turning round. And she at once explained: \u201cI was looking at the new flag they\u2019ve put up over the bathing place. The old one was pretty moth-eaten. But I really think this one is mouldier still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion Albertine was not content with cold indifference, and this made me all the more wretched. She knew that I was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt, who had a \u2018bad style\u2019 and came now and again to spend a few days with Mme. Bontemps. Albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again. And when this woman came to Incarville, Albertine said: \u201cBy the way, you know she\u2019s here. Have they told you?\u201d as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret. One day, when she told me this, she added: \u201cYes, I ran into her on the beach, and knocked against her as I passed, on purpose, to be rude to her.\u201d When Albertine told me this, there came back to my mind a remark made by Mme. Bontemps, to which I had never given a second thought, when she had said to Mme. Swann in my presence how brazen her niece Albertine was, as though that were a merit, and told her how Albertine had reminded some official\u2019s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen. But a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity; it withers, it decays. An evening or two later, I thought again of Albertine\u2019s remark, and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud \u2014 and which could only make me smile \u2014 that it seemed to me to signify, it was something else, to wit that Albertine, perhaps even without any definite object, to irritate this woman\u2019s senses, or wantonly to remind her of former proposals, accepted perhaps in the past, had swiftly brushed against her, thought that I had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public, and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom Albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting, Albertine and I, at the Balbec station of the little local railway. We had driven there in the hotel omnibus, because it was raining. Not far away from us was M. Nissim Bernard, with a black eye. He had recently forsaken the chorister from Athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood, known as the \u2018Cherry Orchard.\u2019 This rubicund youth, with his blunt features, appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head. A tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother. To the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins, that nature, becoming for the moment industrialised, seems to be offering a pattern for sale. Unfortunately M. Nissim Bernard looked at it from another point of view, and this resemblance was only external. Tomato II shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies, Tomato I did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen. Now on each occasion when, stirred, as though by a reflex action, by the memory of pleasant hours spent with Tomato I, M. Bernard presented himself at the Cherry Orchard, being short-sighted (not that one need be short-sighted to mistake them), the old Israelite, unconsciously playing Amphitryon, would accost the twin brother with: \u201cWill you meet me somewhere this evening?\u201d He at once received a resounding smack in the face. It might even be repeated in the course of a single meal, when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first. In the end this treatment so disgusted him, by association of ideas, with tomatoes, even of the edible variety, that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable, at the next table to his own, in the Grand Hotel, he would murmur to him: \u201cYou must excuse me, Sir, for addressing you, without an introduction. But I heard you order tomatoes. They are stale to-day. I tell you in your own interest, for it makes no difference to me, I never touch them myself.\u201d The stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour, call back the waiter, pretend to have changed his mind: \u201cNo, on second thoughts, certainly not, no tomatoes.\u201d Aim\u00e9, who had seen it all before, would laugh to himself, and think: \u201cHe\u2019s an old rascal, that Monsieur Bernard, he\u2019s gone and made another of them change his order.\u201d M. Bernard, as he waited for the already overdue tram, shewed no eagerness to speak to Albertine and myself, because of his black eye. We were even less eager to speak to him. It would however have been almost inevitable if, at that moment, a bicycle had not come dashing towards us; the lift-boy sprang from its saddle, breathless. Madame Verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel, to know whether I would dine with her two days later; we shall see presently why. Then, having given me the message in detail, the lift-boy left us, and, being one of these democratic \u2018employees\u2019 who affect independence with regard to the middle classes, and among themselves restore the principle of authority, explained: \u201cI must be off, because of my chiefs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine\u2019s girl friends had gone, and would be away for some time. I was anxious to provide her with distractions. Even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own, at Balbec, I knew that such happiness is never complete, and that Albertine, being still at the age (which some of us never outgrow) when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it, might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself. I preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which, arranged by myself, would not give us an opportunity of being alone together, while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me. And so I had asked her that day to come with me to Donci\u00e8res, where I was going to meet Saint-Loup. With a similar hope of occupying her mind, I advised her to take up painting, in which she had had lessons in the past. While working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy. I would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the Verdurins and the Cambremers, who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself, but I must first make certain that Mme. Putbus was not yet at la Raspeli\u00e8re. It was only by going there in person that I could make sure of this, and, as I knew beforehand that on the next day but one Albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt, I had seized this opportunity to send Mme. Verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon Wednesday. If Mme. Putbus was there, I would manage to see her maid, ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to Balbec, and if so find out when, so as to take Albertine out of reach on the day. The little local railway, making a loop which did not exist at the time when I had taken it with my grandmother, now extended to Donci\u00e8res-la-Goupil, a big station at which important trains stopped, among them the express by which I had come down to visit Saint-Loup, from Paris, and the corresponding express by which I had returned. And, because of the bad weather, the omnibus from the Grand Hotel took Albertine and myself to the station of the little tram, Balbec-Plage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The little train had not yet arrived, but one could see, lazy and slow, the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake, which, confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud, was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of Criquetot. Finally the little tram, which it had preceded by taking a vertical course, arrived in its turn, at a leisurely crawl. The passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it, but without hurrying, knowing that they were dealing with a good-natured, almost human traveller, who, guided like the bicycle of a beginner, by the obliging signals of the station-master, in the strong hands of the engine-driver, was in no danger of running over anybody, and would come to a halt at the proper place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My telegram explained the Verdurins\u2019 telephone message and had been all the more opportune since Wednesday (the day I had fixed happened to be a Wednesday) was the day set apart for dinner-parties by Mme. Verdurin, at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as in Paris, a fact of which I was unaware. Mme. Verdurin did not give \u2018dinners,\u2019 but she had \u2018Wednesdays.\u2019 These Wednesdays were works of art. While fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere, Mme. Verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them. \u201cLast Wednesday was not as good as the one before,\u201d she would say. \u201cBut I believe the next will be one of the best I have ever given.\u201d Sometimes she went so far as to admit: \u201cThis Wednesday was not worthy of the others. But I have a big surprise for you next week.\u201d In the closing weeks of the Paris season, before leaving for the country, the Mistress would announce the end of the Wednesdays. It gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful. \u201cThere are only three more Wednesdays left, there are only two more,\u201d she would say, in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to miss next Wednesday, for the finale.\u201d But this finale was a sham, for she would announce: \u201cOfficially, there will be no more Wednesdays. To-day was the last for this year. But I shall be at home all the same on Wednesday. We shall have a little Wednesday to ourselves; I dare say these little private Wednesdays will be the nicest of all.\u201d At la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Wednesdays were of necessity restricted, and since, if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way, they would invite him for one or another evening, almost every day of the week became a Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember all the guests, but I know there\u2019s Madame la Marquise de Camembert,\u201d the liftboy had told me; his memory of our discussion of the name Cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world, whose syllables, familiar and full of meaning, came to the young employee\u2019s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name, and were immediately preferred and readopted by him, not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage, but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hastened in search of an empty carriage in which I could hold Alber-tine in my arms throughout the journey. Having failed to find one, we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face, old and ugly, with a masculine expression, very much in her Sunday best, who was reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. Notwithstanding her commonness, she was eclectic in her tastes, and I found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong; I at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel, a procuress on holiday. Her face, her manner, proclaimed the fact aloud. Only, I had never yet supposed that such ladies read the Revue des Deux Mondes. Albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile. The lady wore an air of extreme dignity; and as I, for my part, bore within me the consciousness that I was invited, two days later, to the terminal point of the little railway, by the famous Mme. Verdurin, that at an intermediate station I was awaited by Robert de Saint-Loup, and that a little farther on I had it in my power to give great pleasure to Mme. de Cambremer, by going to stay at F\u00e9terne, my eyes sparkled with irony as I studied this self-important lady who seemed to think that, because of her elaborate attire, the feathers in her hat, her Revue des Deux Mondes, she was a more considerable personage than myself. I hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than M. Nissim Bernard, and that she would alight at least at Toutainville, but no. The train stopped at Evreville, she remained seated. Similarly at Montmartin-sur-Mer, at Parville-la-Bingard, at Incarville, so that in despair, when the train had left Saint-Frichoux, which was the last station before Donci\u00e8res, I began to embrace Albertine without bothering about the lady. At Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Loup had come to meet me at the station, with the greatest difficulty, he told me, for, as he was staying with his aunt, my telegram had only just reached him and he could not, having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand, spare me more than an hour of his time. This hour seemed to me, alas, far too long, for as soon as we had left the train Albertine devoted her whole attention to Saint-Loup. She never talked to me, barely answered me if I addressed her, repulsed me when I approached her. With Robert, on the other hand, she laughed her provoking laugh, talked to him volubly, played with the dog he had brought with him, and, as she excited the animal, deliberately rubbed against its master. I remembered that, on the day when Albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time, I had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task. I thought of him now with horror. Robert must have noticed that I was not unconcerned about Albertine, for he offered no response to her provocations, which made her extremely annoyed with myself; then he spoke to me as though I had been alone, which, when she realised it, raised me again in her esteem. Robert asked me if I would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at Donci\u00e8res, when I was staying there, who were still in the garrison. And as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others: \u201cWhat is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don\u2019t want to see them again?\u201d I declined his offer, for I did not wish to run any risk of being parted from Albertine, but also because now I was detached from them. From them, which is to say from myself. We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally. Even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime, if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been, we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years \u2014 such as Saint-Loup\u2019s friends whom I used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the Faisan Dor\u00e9, and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity. In this respect, and because I preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past, a stroll through Donci\u00e8res. might have seemed to me a pr\u00e9figuration of an arrival in Paradise. We dream much of Paradise, or rather of a number of successive Paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a Paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left us at the station. \u201cBut you may have about an hour to wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you spend it here, you will probably see my uncle Charlus, who is going by the train to Paris, ten minutes before yours. I have said good-bye to him already, because I have to go back before his train starts. I didn\u2019t tell him about you, because I hadn\u2019t got your telegram.\u201d To the reproaches which I heaped upon Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us, she replied that she had intended, by her coldness towards me, to destroy any idea that he might have formed if, at the moment when the train stopped, he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist. He had indeed noticed this attitude (I had not caught sight of him, otherwise I should have adopted one that was more correct), and had had time to murmur in my ear: \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, one of those priggish little girls you told me about, who wouldn\u2019t go near Mlle. de Stermaria because they thought her fast?\u201d I had indeed mentioned to Robert, and in all sincerity, when I went down from Paris to visit him at Donci\u00e8res, and when we were talking about our time at Balbec, that there was nothing to be had from Albertine, that she was the embodiment of virtue. And now that I had long since discovered for myself that this was false, I was even more anxious that Robert should believe it to be true. It would have been sufficient for me to tell Robert that I was in love with Albertine. He was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims. \u201cYes, she is still rather childish. But you don\u2019t know anything against her?\u201d I added anxiously. \u201cNothing, except that I saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour attitude destroyed absolutely nothing,\u201d I told Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us. \u201cQuite true,\u201d she said to me, \u201cit was stupid of me, I hurt your feelings, I\u2019m far more unhappy about it than you are. You\u2019ll see, I shall never be like that again; forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, holding out her hand with a sorrowful air. At that moment, from the entrance to the waiting-room in which we were sitting, I saw advance slowly, followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Paris, where I encountered him only in evening dress, immobile, straitlaced in a black coat, maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness, his thirst for admiration, the soar of his conversation, I had never realised how far he had aged. Now, in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter, as he swaggered through the room, balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind, the cruel light of day broke up into paint, upon his lips, rice-powder fixed by cold cream, on the tip of his nose, black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair, all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I stood talking to him, though briefly, because of his train, I kept my eye on Albertine\u2019s carriage to shew her that I was coming. When I turned my head towards M. de Charlus, he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier, a relative of his, who was standing on the other side of the platform, as though he were waiting to take our train, but in the opposite direction, away from Balbec. \u201cHe is in his regimental band,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cAs you are so fortunate as to be still young enough, and I unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him.\u201d I took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me, and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman. But, just as I was preparing to execute my commission, what was my surprise, and, I may say, my pleasure, on recognising Morel, the son of my uncle\u2019s valet, who recalled to me so many memories. They made me forget to convey M. de Charlus\u2019s message. \u201cWhat, you are at Donci\u00e8res?\u201d \u201cYes, and they\u2019ve put me in the band attached to the batteries.\u201d But he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone. He had become an intense \u2018poseur,\u2019 and evidently the sight of myself, reminding him of his father\u2019s profession, was not pleasing to him. Suddenly I saw M. de Charlus descending upon us. My delay had evidently taxed his patience. \u201cI should like to listen to a little music this evening,\u201d he said to Morel without any preliminaries, \u201cI pay five hundred francs for the evening, which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends, if you have any in the band.\u201d Knowing as I did the insolence of M. de Charlus, I was astonished at his not even saying how d\u2019ye do to his young friend. The Baron did not however give me time to think. Holding out his hand in the friendliest manner: \u201cGood-bye, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, as a hint that I might now leave them. I had, as it happened, left my dear Albertine too long alone. \u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d I said to her as I climbed into the carriage, \u201clife by the sea-side and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors, and with fewer actors than situations.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d \u201cBecause M. de Charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends, whom, this instant, on the platform of this station, I have just discovered to be one of my own.\u201d But as I uttered these words, I began to wonder how the Baron could have bridged the social gulf to which I had not given a thought. It occurred to me first of all that it might be through Jupien, whose niece, as the reader may remember, had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist. What did baffle me completely was that, when due to leave for Paris in five minutes, the Baron should have asked for a musical evening. But, visualising Jupien\u2019s niece again in my memory, I was beginning to find that \u2018recognitions\u2019 did indeed play an important part in life, when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and I realised that I had been absurdly innocent. M. de Charlus had never in his life set eyes upon Morel, nor Morel upon M. de Charlus, who, dazzled but also terrified by a warrior, albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre, had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that I already knew. In any case, the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to Morel for the absence of any previous relations, for I saw that they continued to talk, without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram. As I recalled the manner in which M. de Charlus had come up to Morel and myself, I saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives, when they picked up a woman in the street. Only the desired object had changed its sex. After a certain age, and even if different evolutions are occurring in us, the more we become ourselves, the more our characteristic features are accentuated. For Nature, while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry, breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms. Besides, the arrogance with which M. de Charlus had accosted the violinist is relative, and depends upon the point of view one adopts. It would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him, not by the prefect of police who, a few years later, was to keep him under observation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Paris train is signalled, Sir,\u201d said the porter who was carrying his luggage. \u201cBut I am not going by the train, put it in the cloakroom, damn you!\u201d said M. de Charlus, as he gave twenty francs to the porter, astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip. This generosity at once attracted a flower-seller. \u201cBuy these carnations, look, this lovely rose, kind gentlemen, it will bring you luck.\u201d M. de Charlus, out of patience, handed her a couple of francs, in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing, and her flowers as well. \u201cGood God, why can\u2019t she leave us alone,\u201d said M. de Charlus, addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone, as of a man distraught, to Morel, to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite enough to talk about as it is.\u201d Perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot, perhaps M. de Charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience, perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation. The musician, turning with a frank, imperative and decided air to the flower-seller, raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible. M. de Charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative, virile gesture, made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty, too massively brutal, with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young David capable of waging war against Goliath. The Baron\u2019s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years. \u201cThis is a person whom I should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business. How he would simplify my life,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The train for Paris (which M. de Charlus did not take) started. Then we took our seats in our own train, Albertine and I, without my knowing what had become of M. de Charlus and Morel. \u201cWe must never quarrel any more, I beg your pardon again,\u201d Albertine repeated, alluding to the Saint-Loup incident. \u201cWe must always be nice to each other,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cAs for your friend Saint-Loup, if you think that I am the least bit interested in him, you are quite mistaken. All that I like about him is that he seems so very fond of you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very good fellow,\u201d I said, taking care not to supply Robert with those imaginary excellences which I should not have failed to invent, out of friendship for himself, had I been with anybody but Albertine. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent creature, frank, devoted, loyal, a person you can rely on to do anything.\u201d In saying this I confined myself, held in check by my jealousy, to telling the truth about Saint-Loup, but what I said was literally true. It found expression in precisely the same terms that Mme. de Villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him, when I did not yet know him, imagined him to be so different, so proud, and said to myself: \u201cPeople think him good because he is a great gentleman.\u201d Just as when she had said to me: \u201cHe would be so pleased,\u201d I imagined, after seeing him outside the hotel, preparing to drive away, that his aunt\u2019s speech had been a mere social banality, intended to natter me. And I had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely, thinking of the things that interested me, of my reading, and because she knew that that was what Saint-Loup liked, as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maximes, who wished to consult Robert about him: \u201cHe will be so pleased.\u201d It was simply that I had learned to know him. But, when I set eyes on him for the first time, I had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude. By his feathers I had judged him to be a bird of another species. It was Albertine now who, perhaps a little because Saint-Loup, in his kindness to myself, had been so cold to her, said to me what I had already thought: \u201cAh! He is as devoted as all that! I notice that people always find all the virtues in other people, when they belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d Now that Saint-Loup belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a thing of which I had never once thought in the course of all these years in which, stripping himself of his prestige, he had displayed to me his virtues. A change in our perspective in looking at other people, more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations, but how much more striking still in love, where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness, that far less than the coolness Saint-Loup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that Albertine scorned me, imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman, and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance, Elstir\u2019s judgment when he said to me of the little band, with just the same sentiment as Mme. de Villeparisis speaking of Saint-Loup: \u201cThey are good girls.\u201d But this was not the opinion that I would instinctively have formed when I heard Albertine say: \u201cIn any case, whether he\u2019s devoted or not, I sincerely hope I shall never see him again, since he\u2019s made us quarrel. We must never quarrel again. It isn\u2019t nice.\u201d I felt, since she had seemed to desire Saint-Loup, almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women, which I had supposed to be incurable. And, faced by Albertine\u2019s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person, the tireless vagrant of rainy days, and which, close-fitting, malleable and grey, seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress\u2019s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor, I tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longed-for bosom and, drawing Albertine towards me: \u201cBut won\u2019t you, indolent traveller, dream upon my shoulder, resting your brow upon it?\u201d I said, taking her head in my hands, and shewing her the wide meadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, on the famous Wednesday, in that same little train, which I had again taken, at Balbec, to go and dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, I was taking care not to miss Cottard at Graincourt-Saint-Vast, where a second telephone message from Mme. Verdurin had told me that I should find him. He was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la Raspeli\u00e8re to the station. And so, as the little train barely stopped for a moment at Graincourt, the first station after Donci\u00e8res, I was standing in readiness at the open window, so afraid was I of not seeing Cottard or of his not seeing me. Vain fears! I had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type, so that they, being moreover in full evening dress, as they stood waiting upon the platform, let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance, fashion and familiarity, by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep, like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention, the serried ranks of the common herd, watched for the arrival of some fellow-member who had taken the train at an earlier station, and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come. This sign of election, with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group, was not all that distinguished them; when numerous, in full strength, they were massed together, forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers \u2014 what Brichot called the pecus \u2014 upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name Verdurin, no hope of ever dining at la Raspeli\u00e8re. To be sure, these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing \u2014 notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved \u2014 the names of those of the faithful whom I was astonished to see continuing to dine out, when many of them had already been doing so, according to the stories that I had heard, before my birth, at a period at once so distant and so vague that I was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness. The contrast between the continuance not only of their existence, but of the fulness of their powers, and the annihilation of so many friends whom I had already seen, in one place or another, pass away, gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stop-press column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected, for instance that of an untimely death, which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge. This is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike, but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare. We shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented, in the newspapers, by their obituary notices. Then I saw that, with the passage of time, not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves, but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions, attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders, when it never occurred to us that, after a certain number of years, their disciples, become masters, would be famous also, and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt. But if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus, their aspect still singled them out in its eyes. Indeed in the train (when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day, assembled them all together), having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member, the carriage in which they were gathered, ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor Ski, flagged with Cottard\u2019s Temps, stood out in the distance like a special saloon, and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade. The only one who might, because of his semi-blindness, have missed these welcoming signals, was Brichot. But one of the party would always volunteer to keep a look-out for the blind man, and, as soon as his straw hat, his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye, he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment. So that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful, without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being \u2018on the loose,\u2019 or even of his not having come \u2018by the train,\u2019 should not pick up the others in the course of the journey. Sometimes the opposite process occurred: one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group; but even when thus isolated, alone of his kind, he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect. The Future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite, who would say to himself: \u201cThat must be somebody,\u201d would discern, round the soft hat of Cottard or of the sculptor Ski, a vague aureole and would be only half-astonished when at the next station an elegant crowd, if it were their terminal point, greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages, all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of Douville station, or, if it were an intermediate station, invaded the compartment. This was what was done, and with precipitation, for some of them had arrived late, just as the train which was already in the station was about to start, by the troop which Cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling. Brichot, who was among these faithful, had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others. As his sight became steadily weaker, he had been obliged, even in Paris, to reduce more and more his working hours after dark. Besides he was out of sympathy with the modern Sorbonne, where ideas of scientific exactitude, after the German model, were beginning to prevail over humanism. He now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner; and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits. That is to say, to evenings at the Verdurins\u2019, or to those parties that now and again were offered to the Verdurins by one of the faithful, tremulous with emotion. It is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do, in detaching Brichot from the little clan. But Mme. Verdurin, who kept her eyes open, and moreover, having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon, had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution, had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person, being skilled in (as she expressed it) \u2018putting things in order\u2019 and \u2018applying the red hot iron to the wound.\u2019 This she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons, who was simply Brichot\u2019s laundress, and Mme. Verdurin, having the right of entry into the Professor\u2019s fifth floor rooms, crimson with rage, when she deigned to climb his stairs, had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat!\u201d the Mistress had said to Brichot, \u201ca woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you, and you receive a creature like that?\u201d Brichot had never forgotten the service that Mme. Verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire, and became more and more strongly attached to her, whereas, in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it, the Mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower, and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand. But Brichot derived from his intimacy with the Verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the Sorbonne. They were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinner-parties to which they would never be invited, by the mention made of him in the reviews, the exhibition of his portrait in the Salon, by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the Faculty of Arts esteemed, but without any prospect of attracting his attention, not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher\u2019s attire, an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor, when one is paying a call, and is not the right thing for dinners in the country, however smart, where it should be replaced by a soft hat, which goes quite well with a dinner-jacket. For the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage, I could not even speak to Cottard, for he was suffocated, not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly. He felt more than the joy inherent in success, almost the hilarity of an excellent joke. \u201cAh! That was a good one!\u201d he said when he had recovered himself. \u201cA minute later! \u2018Pon my soul, that\u2019s what they call arriving in the nick of time!\u201d he added, with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt, for he was now overflowing with assurance, but to express his satisfaction. At length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan. I was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in Paris is called smoking. I had forgotten that the Verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways, retarded by the Dreyfus case, accelerated by the \u2018new\u2019 music, an evolution which for that matter they denied, and continued to deny until it was complete, like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them, so as not to appear defeated if he fails. In addition to which, Society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them. It went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in Society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact. The Verdurin salon was understood to be a Temple of Music. It was there, people assured you, that Vinteuil had found inspiration, encouragement. Now, even if Vinteuil\u2019s sonata remained wholly unappreciated, and almost unknown, his name, quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers, had an extraordinary effect. Moreover, certain young men of the Faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes, there were three of them who had studied music, and among these Vinteuil\u2019s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue. They would speak of it, on returning to their homes, to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture. And, taking an interest in what interested their sons, at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at Mme. Verdurin in her front box, following the music in the printed score. So far, this social success latent in the Verdurins was revealed by two facts only. In the first place, Mme. Verdurin would say of the Principessa di Caprarola: \u201cAh! She is intelligent, she is a charming woman. What I cannot endure, are the imbeciles, the people who bore me, they drive me mad.\u201d Which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the Principessa di Caprarola, a woman who moved in the highest society, had called upon Mme. Verdurin. She had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to Mme. Swann after the death of her husband, and had asked whether she knew them. \u201cWhat name did you say?\u201d Odette had asked, with a sudden wistfulness. \u201cVerdurin? Oh, yes, of course,\u201d she had continued in a plaintive tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know them, or rather, I know them without really knowing them, they are people I used to meet at people\u2019s houses, years ago, they are quite nice.\u201d When the Principessa di Caprarola had gone, Odette would fain have spoken the bare truth. But the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations, but the revelation of her fears, of her desires. She denied not what it would have been adroit to deny, but what she would have liked not to have happened, even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact. A little later she had recovered her assurance, and would indeed anticipate questions by saying, so as not to appear to be afraid of them: \u201cMme. Verdurin, why, I used to know her terribly well!\u201d with an affectation of humility, like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram. \u201cThere has been a great deal of talk about the Verdurins lately,\u201d said Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. Odette, with the smiling disdain of a Duchess, replied: \u201cYes, I do seem to have heard a lot about them lately. Every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society,\u201d without reflecting that she herself was among the newest. \u201cThe Principessa di Caprarola has dined there,\u201d Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 went on. \u201cAh!\u201d replied Odette, accentuating her smile, \u201cthat does not surprise me. That sort of thing always begins with the Principessa di Caprarola, and then some one else follows suit, like Comtesse Mole.\u201d Odette, in saying this, appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of \u2018house-warming\u2019 in recently established drawing-rooms. One felt from her tone that the implication was that she, Odette, was, like Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the admission that Mme. Verdurin had made of the Principessa di Caprarola\u2019s intelligence, the second indication that the Verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that (without, of course, their having formally requested it) they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress. M. Verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew, the one who was \u2018in the cart.\u2019 Among those who entered my carriage at Graincourt was Saniette, who long ago had been expelled from the Verdurins\u2019 by his cousin Forcheville, but had since returned. His faults, from the social point of view, had originally been \u2014 notwithstanding his superior qualities \u2014 something like Cottard\u2019s, shyness, anxiety to please, fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so. But if the course of life, by making Cottard assume, if not at the Verdurins\u2019, where he had, because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings, remained more or less the same, at least in his practice, in his hospital ward, at the Academy of Medicine, a shell of coldness, disdain, gravity, that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns, had made a clean cut between the old Cottard and the new, the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in Saniette, the more he sought to correct them. Conscious that he was frequently boring, that people did not listen to him, instead of then slackening his pace as Cottard would have done, of forcing their attention by an air of authority, not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation, he increased his pace, cleared the ground, used abbreviations in order to appear less long-winded, more familiar with the matters of which he spoke, and succeeded only, by making them unintelligible, in seeming interminable. His self-assurance was not like that of Cottard, freezing his patients, who, when other people praised his social graces, would reply: \u201cHe is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room, you with your face to the light, and he with his back to it, and those piercing eyes.\u201d It failed to create an effect, one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness, that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it. Saniette, whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in self-confidence, and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself, attain with ease to the success that was denied to him, never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery, fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares. Sometimes, giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say, people would do him the honour of a general silence. But the story would fall flat. A fellow-guest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to Saniette the private, almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation, making it reach him furtively, without attracting attention, as one passes a note from hand to hand. But nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility, to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh. Long after the story was ended and had fallen flat, Saniette, crestfallen, would remain smiling to himself, as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt. As for the sculptor Ski, so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his Polish surname, and because he himself made an affectation, since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere, of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives, perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous, he had, at forty-four and with no pretension to good looks, a sort of boyishness, a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been, until the age of ten, the most charming prodigal imaginable, the darling of all the ladies. Mme. Verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than Elstir. Any resemblance that there may have been between them was, however, purely external. It was enough to make Elstir, who had met Ski once, feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who r\u00e9semble us in what is least good, in whom are displayed our worst qualities, the faults of which we have cured ourselves, who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are. But Mme. Verdurin thought that Ski had more temperament than Elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression, and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy. This seemed to the Mistress to be actually an additional gift, being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius. Ski would paint anything you asked, on cuff-links or on the panels over doors. He sang with the voice of a composer, played from memory, giving the piano the effect of an orchestra, less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses, which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered, which, for that matter, he would imitate with his lips. Choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression, just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say \u2018Ping!\u2019 so as to let the brasses be heard, he was regarded as marvellously intelligent, but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three, extremely limited. Bored with his reputation for whimsicality, he had set himself to shew that he was a practical, matter-of-fact person, whence a triumphant affectation of false precision, of false common sense, aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate. The movements of his head, neck, limbs, would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old, with golden curls, a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather. Having reached Graincourt station with Cottard and Brichot, with time to spare, he and Cottard had left Brichot in the waiting-room and had gone for a stroll. When Cottard proposed to turn back, Ski had replied: \u201cBut there is no hurry. It isn\u2019t the local train to-day, it\u2019s the departmental train.\u201d Delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon Cottard, he added, with reference to himself: \u201cYes, because Ski loves the arts, because he models in clay, people think he\u2019s not practical. Nobody knows this line better than I do.\u201d Nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when, all of a sudden, catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train, Cottard, with a wild shout, had exclaimed: \u201cWe shall have to put our best foot foremost.\u201d They did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare, the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of Ski. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the Princess on the train?\u201d came in ringing tones from Brichot, whose huge spectacles, resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients, seemed to have taken their life from the Professor\u2019s eyes, and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them, seemed themselves, even at the most trivial moments, to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity. Brichot\u2019s malady, as it gradually deprived him of his sight, had revealed to him the beauties of that sense, just as, frequently, we have to have made up our minds to part with some object, to make a present of it for instance, before we can study it, regret it, admire it. \u201cNo, no, the Princess went over to Maineville with some of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s guests who were taking the Paris train. It is within the bounds of possibility that Mme. Verdurin, who had some business at Saint-Mars, may be with her! In that case, she will be coming with us, and we shall all travel together, which will be delightful. We shall have to keep our eyes skinned at Maineville and see what we shall see! Oh, but that\u2019s nothing, you may say that we came very near to missing the bus. When I saw the train I was dumbfoundered. That\u2019s what is called arriving at the psychological moment. Can\u2019t you picture us missing the train, Mme. Verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us: Tableau!\u201d added the doctor, who had not yet recovered from his emotion. \u201cThat would be a pretty good joke, wouldn\u2019t it? Now then, Brichot, what have you to say about our little escapade?\u201d inquired the doctor with a note of pride. \u201cUpon my soul,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cwhy, yes, if you had found the train gone, that would have been what the late Villemain used to call a wipe in the eye!\u201d But I, distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me, was suddenly reminded of what Cottard had said to me in the ball-room of the little casino, and, just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory, the vision of Albertine leaning her breasts against Andr\u00e9e\u2019s caused my heart a terrible pain. This pain did not last: the idea of Albertine\u2019s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion, forty-eight hours earlier, when the advances that my mistress had made to Saint-Loup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old. I was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another. At Harambouville, as the tram was full, a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment. The doctor, feeling that the Princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person, called a porter, shewed his card, describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies, and obliged the station-master to make the farmer get out. This incident so pained and alarmed Saniette\u2019s timid spirit that, as soon as he saw it beginning, fearing already lest, in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform, it should assume the proportions of a rising, he pretended to be suffering from a stomach-ache, and, so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor\u2019s violence, wandered down the corridor, pretending to be looking for what Cottard called the \u2018water.\u2019 Failing to find one, he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the \u2018twister.\u2019 \u201cIf this is your first appearance at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Sir,\u201d I was addressed by Brichot, anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer, \u201cyou will find that there is no place where one feels more the \u2018amenities of life,\u2019 to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism, of pococurantism, of all sorts of words in \u2014 ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses, I refer to M. le Prince de Talleyrand.\u201d For, when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past, he thought it clever and \u2018in the period\u2019 to prefix a \u2018M.\u2019 to their titles, and said \u2018M. le Duc de La Rochefoucauld,\u2019 \u2018M. le Cardinal de Retz,\u2019 referring to these also as \u2018That struggle-for-lifer de Gondi,\u2019 \u2018that Boulangist de Marcillac.\u2019 And he never failed to call Montesquieu, with a smile, when he referred to him: \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident Second\u00e2t de Montesquieu.\u201d An intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lecture-room. But in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a Prince, there is a pedantry also, which betrays a different caste, that in which one prefixes \u2018the Emperor\u2019 to the name \u2018William\u2019 and addresses a Royal Highness in the third person. \u201cAh, now that is a man,\u201d Brichot continued, still referring to \u2018Monsieur le Prince de Talleyrand\u2019\u2014\u201cto whom we take off our hats. He is an ancestor.\u201d \u201cIt is a charming house,\u201d Cottard told me, \u201cyou will find a little of everything, for Mme. Verdurin is not exclusive, great scholars like Brichot, the high nobility, such as the Princess Sherbatoff, a great Russian lady, a friend of the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted.\u201d As a matter of fact the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, not wishing Princess Sherbatoff, who for years past had been cut by everyone, to come to her house when there might be other people, allowed her to come only in the early morning, when Her Imperial Highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the Princess as it would have been awkward for the Princess to meet them. As, for the last three years, as soon as she came away, like a manicurist, from the Grand Duchess, Mme. Sherbatoff would go on to Mme. Verdurin, who had just awoken, and stuck to her for the rest of the day, one might say that the Princess\u2019s loyalty surpassed even that of Brichot, constant as he was at those Wednesdays, both in Paris, where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of Chateaubriand at l\u2019Abbaye-aux-Bois, and in the country, where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of Mme. de Ch\u00e2telet the man whom he always named (with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction): \u201cM. de Voltaire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her want of friends had enabled Princess Sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the Verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 the type of faithfulness, the ideal which Mme. Verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now, in her later years, she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit. However keenly the Mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy, it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have \u2018failed\u2019 her at least once. The most stay-at-home yielded to the temptation to travel; the most continent fell from virtue; the most robust might catch influenza, the idlest be caught for his month\u2019s soldiering, the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother. And it was in vain that Mme. Verdurin told them then, like the Roman Empress, that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey, like the Christ or the Kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her, that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company, by her, their sole remedy and sole delight. But destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made Mme. Verdurin meet the Princess Sherbatoff. Out of touch with her family, an exile from her native land, knowing nobody but the Baroness Putbus and the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, to whose houses, because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former, and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the Princess, she went only in the early morning hours when Mme. Verdurin was still asleep, never once, so far as she could remember, having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old, when she had had the measles, having on the 3lst of December replied to Mme. Verdurin who, afraid of being left alone, had asked her whether she would not \u2018shake down\u2019 there for the night, in spite of its being New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cWhy, what is there to prevent me, any day of the year? Besides, to-morrow is a day when one stays at home, and this is my home,\u201d living in a boarding-house, and moving from it whenever the Verdurins moved, accompanying them upon their holidays, the Princess had so completely exemplified to Mme. Verdurin the line of Vigny:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou only didst appear that which one seeks always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the Lady President of the little circle, anxious to make sure of one of her \u2018faithful\u2019 even after death, had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side. Before strangers \u2014 among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread: ourself \u2014 Princess Sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships \u2014 with the Grand Duchess, the Verdurins, and the Baroness Putbus \u2014 as the only ones, not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest, but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other, and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself. \u201cI see nobody else,\u201d she would say, insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits. She would add: \u201cI visit only three houses,\u201d as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play. Whether or not M. and Mme. Verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction, they had helped the Princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful. And they in turn were persuaded both that the Princess, among the thousands of invitations that were offered her, had chosen the Verdurins alone, and that the Verdurins, courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their eyes, the Princess, too far superior to her native element not to find it boring, among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed, found the Verdurins alone entertaining, while they, in return, deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind, the Princess Sherbatoff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess was very rich; she engaged for every first night a large box, to which, with the assent of Mme. Verdurin, she invited the faithful and nobody else. People would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white, turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits. They admired both her influence and her humility, for, having always with her an Academician, Brichot, a famous scientist, Cottard, the leading pianist of the day, at a later date M. de Charlus, she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre, remained in the background, paid no attention to the rest of the house, lived exclusively for the little group, who, shortly before the end of the performance, would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign, who was not without a certain timid, fascinating, faded beauty. But if Mme. Sherbatoff did not look at the audience, remained in shadow, it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know: the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger. Nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit. They imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew, that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men. The Princess was compelled, if you spoke to her about anyone, or introduced anyone to her, to feign an intense coldness, in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society. Nevertheless, with the support of Cottard or Mme. Verdurin, several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation, and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer. If he was entirely unimportant, the rest would be astonished. \u201cHow strange that the Princess, who refuses to know anyone, should make an exception of such an uninteresting person.\u201d But these fertilising acquaintances were rare, and the Princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard said far more often: \u201cI shall see him on Wednesday at the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d than: \u201cI shall see him on Tuesday at the Academy.\u201d He spoke, too, of the Wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable. But Cottard was one of those people, little sought after, who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders, like a military or judicial summons. It required a call from a very important patient to make him \u201cfail\u201d the Verdurins on a Wednesday, the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint. For Cottard, excellent fellow as he was, would forego the delights of a Wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke, but for a Minister\u2019s cold. Even then he would say to his wife: \u201cMake my apologies to Mme. Verdurin. Tell her that I shall be coming later on. His Excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold.\u201d One Wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm, Cottard, already in his dinner-jacket to go to the Verdurins\u2019, had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut: \u201cOf course I can\u2019t, L\u00e9ontine,\u201d he had groaned; \u201ccan\u2019t you see I\u2019ve got my white waistcoat on?\u201d So as not to annoy her husband, Mme. Cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser. He, to save time, had taken a cab, with the result that, his carriage entering the courtyard just as Cottard\u2019s was emerging to take him to the Verdurins\u2019, five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass. Mme. Cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress. Cottard sat cursing the delay, from remorse perhaps, and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the Wednesday\u2019s pleasures to dispel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If one of Cottard\u2019s patients were to ask him: \u201cDo you ever see the Guermantes?\u201d it was with the utmost sincerity that the Professor would reply: \u201cPerhaps not actually the Guermantes, I can\u2019t be certain. But I meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine. You must, of course, have heard of the Verdurins. They know everybody. Besides, they certainly are not people who\u2019ve come down in the world. They\u2019ve got the goods, all right. It is generally estimated that Mme. Verdurin is worth thirty-five million. Gad, thirty-five million, that\u2019s a pretty figure. And so she doesn\u2019t make two bites at a cherry. You mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes. Let me explain the difference. Mme. Verdurin is a great lady, the Duchesse de Guermantes is probably a nobody. You see the distinction, of course. In any case, whether the Guermantes go to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or not, she entertains all the very best people, the d\u2019Sherbat\u00f4ffs, the d\u2019Forchevilles, e tutti quanti, people of the highest flight, all the nobility of France and Navarre, with whom you would see me conversing as man to man. Of course, those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science,\u201d he added, with a smile of fatuous conceit, brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like Potain and Charcot should now be applicable to himself, as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom, and, after a long course of study, had learned them by heart. And so, after mentioning to me Princess Sherbatoff as one of the people who went to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Cottard added with a wink: \u201cThat gives you an idea of the style of the house, if you see what I mean?\u201d He meant that it was the very height of fashion. Now, to entertain a Russian lady who knew nobody but the Grand Duchess Eudoxie was not fashionable at all. But Princess Sherbatoff might not have known even her, it would in no way have diminished Cottard\u2019s estimate of the supreme elegance of the Verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there. The splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage, in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels, when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper. A man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth, who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances, because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes. The same man, on the other hand, need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people, for innumerable Cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawing-rooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance, ladies who were not even what Mme. de Villeparisis and her friends were (great ladies fallen from their greatness, whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited); no, those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men, if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties, Mme. de Cambremer would be no more able than Mme. de Guermantes to identify them. But what of that! A Cottard has thus his Marquise, who is to him \u201cthe Baronne,\u201d as in Marivaux, the Baronne whose name is never mentioned, so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name. Cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy \u2014 which has never heard of the lady \u2014 in that, the more dubious titles are, the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses, silver, notepaper, luggage. Many Cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among Princes, just as with the small shopkeeper who, on Sundays, goes sometimes to look at \u201cold time\u201d buildings, it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time, the vaults of which have been, by the pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars, that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages. \u201cThe Princess will be at Maineville. She will be coming with us. But I shall not introduce you to her at once. It will be better to leave that to Mme. Verdurin. Unless I find a loophole. Then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns.\u201d \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d asked Saniette, as he rejoined us, pretending to have gone out to take the air. \u201cI was quoting to this gentleman,\u201d said Brichot, \u201ca saying, which you will remember, of the man who, to my mind, is the first of the fins-de-si\u00e8cle (of the eighteenth century, that is), by name Charles Maurice, Abb\u00e9 de Perigord. He began by promising to be an excellent journalist. But he made a bad end, by which I mean that he became a Minister! Life has these tragedies. A far from serapulous politician to boot who, with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman, did not hesitate to work in his time for the King of Prussia, there are no two ways about it, and died in the skin of a \u2018Left Centre.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs we were joined by a glorious girl who, unfortunately, was not one of the little group. I could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin, her dark eyes, her bold and admirable outlines. A moment later she wanted to open a window, for it was hot in the compartment, and not wishing to ask leave of everybody, as I alone was without a greatcoat, she said to me in a quick, cool, jocular voice: \u201cDo you mind a little fresh air, Sir?\u201d I would have liked to say to her: \u201cCome with us to the Verdurins\u2019?\u201d or \u201cGive me your name and address.\u201d I answered: \u201cNo, fresh air doesn\u2019t bother me, Mademoiselle.\u201d Whereupon, without stirring from her seat: \u201cDo your friends object to smoke?\u201d and she lit a cigarette. At the third station she sprang from the carriage. Next day, I inquired of Albertine, who could she be. For, stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love, in my jealousy of Albertine\u2019s attitude towards Robert, I was reassured so far as other women were concerned. Albertine told me, I believe quite sincerely, that she did not know. \u201cI should so much like to see her again,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, one always sees people again,\u201d replied Albertine. In this particular instance, she was wrong; I never saw again, nor did I ever identify, the pretty girl with the cigarette. We shall see, moreover, why, for a long time, I ceased to look for her. But I have not forgotten her. I find myself at times, when I think of her, seized by a wild longing. But these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded. We can sometimes find a person again, but we cannot abolish time. And so on until the unforeseen day, gloomy as a winter night, when we no longer seek for that girl, or for any other, when to find her would actually frighten us. For we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her, or strength to love her. Not, of course, that we are, in the strict sense of the word, impotent. And as for loving, we should love her more than ever. But we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left. Eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them. To set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap. To be seen in such a state by a girl we love, even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth! We can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth. All the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing! We procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract, who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill no news, I suppose, of the violinist,\u201d said Cottard. The event of the day in the little clan was, in fact, the failure of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite violinist. Employed on military service near Donci\u00e8res, he came three times a week to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, having a midnight pass. But two days ago, for the first time, the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram. It was supposed that he had missed it. But albeit Mme. Verdurin had sent to meet the next tram, and so on until the last had arrived, the carriage had returned empty. \u201cHe\u2019s certain to have been shoved into the guard-room, there\u2019s no other explanation of his desertion. Gad! In soldiering, you know, with those fellows, it only needs a bad-tempered serjeant.\u201d \u201cIt will be all the more mortifying for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cif he fails again this evening, because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d \u201cThis evening, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer!\u201d exclaimed Cottard. \u201cBut I knew absolutely nothing about it. Naturally, I knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day, but I had no idea that it was to be so soon. Sapristi!\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201cwhat did I tell you? The Princess Sherbatoff, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d And, after repeating these names, lulling himself with their melody: \u201cYou see that we move in good company,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s your first appearance, you\u2019ll be one of the crowd. It is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering.\u201d And, turning to Brichot, he went on: \u201cThe Mistress will be furious. It is time we appeared to lend her a hand.\u201d Ever since Mme. Verdurin had been at la Raspeli\u00e8re she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening. By so doing she would obtain better terms next year, she explained, and was inviting them for business reasons only. But she pretended to regard with such terror, to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day. The prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed, albeit exaggerating them, if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself. She was therefore partly sincere, she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world, one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce, that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials, people ignorant of the Ring and the Meistersinger, who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable, by coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, of ruining one of those famous Wednesdays, masterpieces of art incomparable and frail, like those Venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter. \u201cBesides, they are bound to be absolutely anti, and militarists,\u201d M. Verdurin had said. \u201cOh, as for that, I don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ve heard quite enough about all that business,\u201d had replied Mme. Verdurin, who, a sincere Dreyfusard, would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant Dreyfusism of her salon. For Dreyfusism was triumphant politically, but not socially. Labori, Reinach, Picquart, Zola were still, to people in society, more or less traitors, who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus. And so, after this incursion into politics, Mme. Verdurin was determined to return to the world of art. Besides were not Indy, Debussy, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side in the Case? \u201cSo far as the Case goes, we need only remember Brichot,\u201d she said (the Don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the General Staff, which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of Madame Verdurin). \u201cThere is no need to be eternally discussing the Dreyfus case. No, the fact of the matter is that the Cambremers bore me.\u201d As for the faithful, no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the Cambremers\u2019 acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which Mme. Verdurin said she felt to invite them, they returned, day after day, in conversation with her, to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation, tried to make them irresistible. \u201cMake up your mind to it once and for all,\u201d Cottard repeated, \u201cand you will have better terms for next year, they will pay the gardener, you will have the use of the meadow. That will be well worth a boring evening. I am thinking only of yourselves,\u201d he added, albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion, when, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s carriage, he had met the carriage of the old Mme. de Cambremer and, what was more, he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when, at the station, he had found himself standing beside the Marquis. For their part, the Cambremers, living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of Mme. Verdurin, imagined that she was a person who could know none but Bohemians, was perhaps not even legally married, and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves. They had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who, they hoped, would return again for many seasons, especially after they had, in the previous month, learned that she had recently inherited all those millions. It was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day. The faithful had given up hope of its ever coming, so often had Mme. Verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed. These false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinner-party, but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail. Not that the Mistress guessed that the \u201cgreat day\u201d was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself, but in order that, having persuaded them that this dinner-party was to her the most terrible of social duties, she might make an appeal to their devotion. \u201cYou are not going to leave me all alone with those Chinese mandarins! We must assemble in full force to support the boredom. Naturally, we shan\u2019t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested. It will be a Wednesday spoiled, but what is one to do!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d Brichot explained to me, \u201cI fancy that Mme. Verdurin, who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her Wednesdays, was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains. She could not bring herself to invite the dowager Marquise, but has resigned herself to having the son and daughter-in-law.\u201d \u201cAh! We are to see the Marquise de Cambremer?\u201d said Cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality, albeit he had no idea whether Mme. de Cambremer were good-looking or not. But the title Marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry. \u201cAh! I know her,\u201d said Ski, who had met her once when he was out with Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNot in the biblical sense of the word, I trust,\u201d said the doctor, darting a sly glance through his eyeglass; this was one of his favourite pleasantries. \u201cShe is intelligent,\u201d Ski informed me. \u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, seeing that I said nothing, and dwelling with a smile upon each word, \u201cshe is intelligent and at the same time she is not, she lacks education, she is frivolous, but she has an instinct for beautiful things. She may say nothing, but she will never say anything silly. And besides, her colouring is charming. She would be an amusing person to paint,\u201d he added, half shutting his eyes, as though he saw her posing in front of him. As my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what Ski was expressing with so many fine shades, I observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer, M. Legrandin. \u201cThere, you see, you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman,\u201d Brichot said to me, \u201cand one never knows what may come of that. Cleopatra was not even a great lady, she was a little woman, the unconscious, terrible little woman of our Meilhac, and just think of the consequences, not only to that idiot Antony, but to the whole of the ancient world.\u201d \u201cI have already been introduced to Mme. de Cambremer,\u201d I replied. \u201cAh! In that case, you will find yourself on familiar ground.\u201d \u201cI shall be all the more delighted to meet her,\u201d I answered him, \u201cbecause she has promised me a book by the former cur\u00e9 of Com-bray about the place-names of this district, and I shall be able to remind her of her promise. I am interested in that priest, and also in etymologies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t put any faith in the ones he gives,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthere is a copy of the book at la Raspeli\u00e8re, which I have glanced through, but without finding anything of any value; it is a mass of error. Let me give you an example. The word Bricq is found in a number of place-names in this neighbourhood. The worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from Briga, a height, a fortified place. He finds it already in the Celtic tribes, Latobriges, Nemetobriges, and so forth, and traces it down to such names as Briand, Brion, and so forth. To confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment, Bricquebose means the wood on the height, Bricqueville the habitation on the height, Bricquebec, where we shall be stopping presently before coming to Maineville, the height by the stream. Now there is not a word of truth in all this, for the simple reason that bricq is the old Norse word which means simply a bridge. Just as fleur, which Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 takes infinite pains to connect, in one place with the Scandinavian words floi, flo, in another with the Irish word ae or aer, is, beyond any doubt, the fjord of the Danes, and means harbour. So too, the excellent priest thinks that the station of Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, which adjoins la Raspeli\u00e8re, means Saint-Martin-le-Vieux (vetus). It is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region. Vieux comes as a rule from vadum, and means a passage, as at the place called les Vieux. It is what the English call ford (Oxford, Hereford). But, in this particular instance, V\u00eatu is derived not from vetus, but from vas-tatus, a place that is devastated and bare. You have, round about here, Sottevast, the vast of Setold, Brillevast, the vast of Berold. I am all the more certain of the cure\u2019s mistake, in that Saint-Mars-le-Vetu was formerly called Saint-Mars du Cast and even Saint-Mars-de-Terregate. Now the v and the g in these words are the same letter. We say d\u00e9vaster, but also g\u00e2cher. J\u00e2ch\u00e8res andgatines (from the High German wastinna) have the same meaning: Terregate is therefore terra vasta. As for Saint-Mars, formerly (save the mark) Saint-Merd, it is Saint-Medardus, which appears variously as Saint-M\u00e9dard, Saint-Mard, Saint-Marc, Cinq-Mars, and even Dammas. Nor must we forget that quite close to here, places bearing the name of Mars are proof simply of a pagan origin (the god Mars) which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see. The high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent, such as the mount of Jupiter (Jeumont). Your cur\u00e9 declines to admit this, but, on the other hand, wherever Christianity has left traces, they escape his notice. He has gone so far afield as to Loctudy, a barbarian name, according to him, whereas it is simply Locus Sancti Tudeni, nor has he in Sammarcoles divined Sanctus Martialis. Your cur\u00e9,\u201d Brichot continued, seeing that I was interested, \u201cderives the terminations hon, home, holm, from the word holl (hullus), a hill, whereas it cornes from the Norse holm, an island, with which you are familiar in Stockholm, and which is so widespread throughout this district, la Houlme, Engohomme, Tahoume, Robehomme, N\u00e9homme, Quettehon, and so forth.\u201d These names made me think of the day when Albertine had wished to go to Amfreville-la-Bigot (from the name of two successive lords of the manor, Brichot told me), and had then suggested that we should dine together at Robehomme. As for Maineville, we were just coming to it. \u201cIsn\u2019t N\u00e9homme,\u201d I asked, \u201csomewhere near Carquethuit and Clitourps?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; N\u00e9homme is the holm, the island or peninsula of the famous Viscount Nigel, whose name has survived also in Neville. The Carquethuit and Clitourps that you mention furnish Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an occasion for further blunders. No doubt he has seen that carque is a church, the Kirche of the Germans. You will remember Querqueville, not to mention Dun-kerque. For there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word Dun, which to the Celts meant high ground. And that you will find over the whole of France. Your abb\u00e9 was hypnotised by Duneville, which recurs in the Eure-et-Loir; he would have found Ch\u00e2teaudun, Dun-le-Roi in the Cher, Duneau in the Sarthe, Dun in the Ari\u00e8ge, Dune-les-Places in the Ni\u00e8vre, and many others. This word Dun leads him into a curious error with regard to Douville where we shall be alighting, and shall find Mme. Verdurin\u2019s comfortable carriages awaiting us. Douville, in Latin donvilla, says he. As a matter of fact, Douville does lie at the foot of high hills. Your cur\u00e9, who knows everything, feels all the same that he has made a blunder. He has, indeed, found in an old cartulary, the name Domvilla. Whereupon he retracts; Douville, according to him, is a fief belonging to the Abbot, Domino Abbati, of Mont Saint-Michel. He is delighted with the discovery, which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that, according to the Capitulary of Sainte-Claire sur Epte, was led at Mont Saint-Michel, though no more extraordinary than to picture the King of Denmark as suzerain of all this coast, where he encouraged the worship of Odin far more than that of Christ. On the other hand, the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me, and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct Lyon, which also is derived from Dun (Lugdunum). But the fact is, the abb\u00e9 is mistaken. Douville was never Donville, but Doville, Eudonis villa, the village of Eudes. Douville was formerly called Escalecliff, the steps up the cliff. About the year 1233, Eudes le Bouteiller, Lord of Escalecliff, set out for the Holy Land; on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the Abbey of Blanche-lande. By an exchange of courtesies, the village took his name, whence we have Douville to-day. But I must add that toponymy, of which moreover I know little or nothing, is not an exact science; had we not this historical evidence, Douville might quite well come from Ouville, that is to say the Waters. The forms in ai (Aigu\u00ebs-Mortes), from aqua, are constantly changed to eu or ou. Now there were, quite close to Douville, certain famous springs, Carquethuit. You might suppose that the cur\u00e9 was only too ready to detect there a Christian origin, especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert, since successive attempts were made by Saint Ursal, Saint Gofroi, Saint Barsanore, Saint Laurent of Br\u00e8vedent, who finally handed over the task to the monks of Beaubec. But as regards thuit the writer is mistaken, he sees in it a form of toft, a building, as in Cricquetot, Ectot, Yvetot, whereas it is the thveit, the clearing, the reclaimed land, as in Braquetuit, le Thuit, Regnetuit, and so forth. Similarly, if he recognises in Clitourps the Norman thorp which means village, he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus, a slope, whereas it comes from cliff, a precipice. But his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices. However loyal a Frenchman one is, there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take Saint-Laurent en Bray to be the Roman priest, so famous at one time, when he is actually Saint Lawrence \u2018Toot, Archbishop of Dublin. But even more than his patriotic sentiments, your friend\u2019s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors. Thus you have not far from our hosts at la Raspeli\u00e8re two places called Montmartin, Montmartin-sur-Mer and Mont-martin-en-Graignes. In the case of Craignes, the good cur\u00e9 has been quite right, he has seen that Craignes, in Latin Crania, in GreekKrene, means ponds, marshes; how many instances of Cresmays, Croen, Gremeville, Lengronne, might we not adduce? But, when he comes to Montmartin, your self-styled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to Saint Martin. He bases his opinion upon the fact that the Saint is their patron, but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently; or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism; he refuses to see that we should say Mont-Saint-Martin as we say Mont-Saint-Michel, if it were a question of Saint Martin, whereas the name Montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god Mars, temples of which, it is true, no other vestige remains, but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast Roman camps would render highly probable even without the name Montmartin, which removes all doubt. You see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la Raspeli\u00e8re is far from perfect.\u201d I protested that at Combray the cur\u00e9 had often told us interesting etymologies. \u201cHe was probably better on his own ground, the move to Normandy must have made him lose his bearings.\u201d \u201cNor did it do him any good,\u201d I added, \u201cfor he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism.\u201d \u201cAh, his neurasthenia is to blame. He has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology, as my worthy master Pocquelin would have said. Tell us, Cottard, do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology, philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly, rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuro-arthritism. You may pass from one to the other by metastasis.\u201d \u201cThe eminent Professor,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cexpresses himself in a French as highly infused with Latin and Greek as M. Purgon himself, of Moli\u00e8resque memory! My uncle, I refer to our national Sarcey. . . . \u201d But he was prevented from finishing his sentence. The Professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout: \u201cThe devil!\u201d he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech, \u201cwe have passed Maineville (d\u2019you hear?) and Renneville too.\u201d He had just noticed that the train was stopping at Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, where most of the passengers alighted. \u201cThey can\u2019t have run through without stopping. We must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the Cambremers. Listen to me, Ski, pay attention, I am going to tell you \u2018a good one,\u2019\u201d said Cottard, who had taken a fancy to this expression, in common use in certain medical circles. \u201cThe Princess must be on the train, she can\u2019t have seen us, and will have got into another compartment. Come along and find her. Let\u2019s hope this won\u2019t land us in trouble!\u201d And he led us all off in search of Princess Sherbatoff. He found her in the corner of an empty compartment, reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. She had long ago, from fear of rebuffs, acquired the habit of keeping in her place, or remaining in her corner, in life as on the train, and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her. She went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage. I recognised her immediately; this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth, who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the Verdurins\u2019, was the lady whom, on the same train, I had put down, two days earlier, as possibly the keeper of a brothel. Her social personality, which had been so vague, became clear to me as soon as I learned her name, just as when, after racking our brains over a puzzle, we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity, and which, in the case of a person, is his name. To discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number. Big restaurants, casinos, local trains, are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas. \u201cPrincess, we must have missed you at Maineville! May we come and sit in your compartment?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Princess who, upon hearing Cottard address her, but only then, raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which, like the eyes of M. de Charlus, although gentler, saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware. Cottard, coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the Cambremers was a sufficient recommendation, decided, after a momentary hesitation, to intro-duce me to the Princess, who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time. \u201cCr\u00e9 nom!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cmy wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waist-coat. Ah! Those women, they never remember anything. Don\u2019t you ever marry, my boy,\u201d he said to me. And as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say, he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the Princess and the rest of the faithful, who, because he was a Professor and an Academician, smiled back, admiring his good temper and freedom from pride. The Princess informed us that the young violinist had been found. He had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache, but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at Donci\u00e8res. She had learned this from Mme. Verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning, she told us in a rapid voice, rolling her r_s, with her Russian accent, softly at the back of her throat, as though they were not r_s but l_s. \u201cAh! You had luncheon with her this morning,\u201d Cottard said to the Princess; but turned his eyes to myself, the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the Princess was with the Mistress. \u201cYou are indeed a faithful adherent!\u201d \u201cYes, I love the little cirlcle, so intelligent, so agleeable, neverl spiteful, quite simple, not at all snobbish, and clevel to theirl fingle-tips.\u201d \u201cNom d\u2019une pipe! I must have lost my ticket, I can\u2019t find it anywhere,\u201d cried Cottard, with an agitation that was, in the circumstances, quite unjustified. He knew that at Douville, where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us, the collector would let him pass without a ticket, and would only bare his head all the more humbly, so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence, to wit that he had of course recognised Cottard as one of the Verdurins\u2019 regular guests. \u201cThey won\u2019t shove me in the lock-up for that,\u201d the doctor concluded. \u201cYou were saying, Sir,\u201d I inquired of Brichot, \u201cthat there used to be some famous waters near here; how do we know that?\u201d \u201cThe name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs. It is called Fervaches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t undlestand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d mumbled the Princess, as though she were saying to me out of politeness: \u201cHe\u2019s rather a bore, ain\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWhy, Princess, Fervaches means hot springs. Fervidae aquae. But to return to the young violinist,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cI was quite forgetting, Cottard, to tell you the great news. Had you heard that our poor friend Dechambre, who used to be Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite pianist, has just died? It is terribly sad.\u201d \u201cHe was quite young,\u201d replied Cottard, \u201cbut he must have had some trouble with his liver, there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter, he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past.\u201d \u201cBut he was not so young as all that,\u201d said Brichot; \u201cin the days when Elstir and Swann used to come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Dechambre had already made himself a reputation in Paris, and, what is remarkable, without having first received the baptism of success abroad. Ah! He was no follower of the Gospel according to Saint Barnum, that fellow.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, he could not have been going to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, at that time, he was still in the nursery.\u201d \u201cBut, unless my old memory plays me false, I was under the impression that Dechambre used to play Vinteuil\u2019s sonata for Swann, when that clubman, who had broken with the aristocracy, had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised Prince Consort of our national Odette.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata was played at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s long after Swann ceased to come there,\u201d said the doctor, who, like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them, forget many others, a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do. \u201cYou are hopelessly muddled, though your brain is as sound as ever,\u201d said the doctor with a smile. Brichot admitted that he was mistaken. The train stopped. We were at la Sogne. The name stirred my curiosity. \u201cHow I should like to know what all these names mean,\u201d I said to Cottard. \u201cYou must ask M. Brichot, he may know, perhaps.\u201d \u201cWhy, la Sogne is la Cicogne, Siconia,\u201d replied Brichot, whom I was burning to interrogate about many other names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting her attachment to her \u2018corner,\u2019 Mme. Sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me, so that I might talk more easily with Brichot, whom I wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me, and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine, standing, or seated, or anyhow. She remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer\u2019s intentions, but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly, she would do everything in her power to oblige. At length the train stopped at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, which being more or less equidistant from the villages of F\u00e9terne and Douville, bore for this reason their hyphenated name. \u201cSaperlipopette!\u201d exclaimed Doctor Cottard, when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected, and, pretending to have only just discovered his loss, \u201cI can\u2019t find my ticket, I must have lost it.\u201d But the collector, taking off his cap, assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully. The Princess (giving instructions to the coachman, as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to Mme. Verdurin, who, because of the Cambremers, had not been able to come to the station, as, for that matter, she rarely did) took me, and also Brichot, with herself in one of the carriages. The doctor, Saniette and Ski got into the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver, although quite young, was the Verdurins\u2019 first coachman, the only one who had any right to the title; he took them, in the daytime, on all their excursions, for he knew all the roads, and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on. He was accompanied by extra helpers (whom he selected if necessary). He was an excellent fellow, sober and capable, but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion, not to say nourish dark thoughts. But at the moment he was quite happy, for he had managed to secure a place for his brother, another excellent type of fellow, with the Verdurins. We began by driving through Douville. Grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea, in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness, a softness, a vivacity of extreme tones. The islands and indentations of Rivebelle, far nearer now than at Balbec, gave this part of the coast the appearance, novel to me, of a relief map. We passed by some little bungalows, almost all of which were let to painters; turned into a track upon which some loose cattle, as frightened as were our horses, barred our way for ten minutes, and emerged upon the cliff road. \u201cBut, by the immortal gods,\u201d Brichot suddenly asked, \u201clet us return to that poor Dechambre; do you suppose Mme. Verdurin knows? Has anyone toldher?\u201d Mme. Verdurin, like most people who move in society, simply because she needed the society of other people, never thought of them again for a single day, as soon as, being dead, they could no longer come to the Wednesdays, nor to the Saturdays, nor dine without dressing. And one could not say of the little clan, a type in this respect of all salons, that it was composed of more dead than living members, seeing that, as soon as one was dead, it was as though one had never existed. But, to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased, in other words to postpone one of the dinners \u2014 a thing impossible to the mistress \u2014 as a token of mourning, M. Verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that, in the interest of her health, it must never be mentioned to her. Moreover, and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive, so vulgar an accident, the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it. As for Brichot, since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what M. Verdurin said about his wife, he dreaded for his friend\u2019s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her. \u201cYes, she knew the worst this morning,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cit was impossible to keep it from her.\u201d \u201cAh! Thousand thunders of Zeus!\u201d cried Brichot. \u201cAh! it must have been a terrible blow, a friend of twenty-five years\u2019 standing. There was a man who was one of us.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course, what can you expect? Such incidents are bound to be painful; but Madame Verdurin is a brave woman, she is even more cerebral than emotive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t altogether agree with the Doctor,\u201d said the Princess, whose rapid speech, her murmured accents, certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious. \u201cMme. Verdurin, beneath a cold exterior, conceals treasures of sensibility. M. Verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to Paris for the funeral; he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country.\u201d \u201cThe devil! She wanted to go to Paris, did she? Of course, I know that she has a heart, too much heart perhaps. Poor Dechambre! As Madame Verdurin remarked not two months ago: \u2018Compared with him, Plant\u00e9, Paderewski, Risler himself are nowhere!\u2019 Ah, he could say with better reason than that limelighter Nero, who has managed to take in even German scholarship:Qualis artifex pereo! But he at least, Dechambre, must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood, in the odour of Beethovenian devotion; and gallantly, I have no doubt; he had every right, that interpreter of German music, to pass away while celebrating the Mass in D. But he was, when all is said, the man to greet the unseen with a cheer, for that inspired performer would produce at times from the Parisianised Champagne stock of which he came, the swagger and smartness of a guardsman.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the height we had now reached, the sea suggested no longer, as at Balbec, the undulations of swelling mountains, but on the contrary the view, beheld from a mountain-top or from a road winding round its flank, of a blue-green glacier or a glittering plain, situated at a lower level. The lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface, and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles; the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour, assumed towards the head of the bay, where an estuary opened, the blue whiteness of milk, in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies. I felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect. But at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the Douville toll-house, the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay, withdrew, and all of a sudden I descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which I had already had before me, but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty. The air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me. I adored the Verdurins; that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness. I should have liked to kiss the Princess. I told her that I had never seen anything so beautiful. She professed that she too loved this spot more than any other. But I could see that to her as to the Verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists, but to partake of good meals there, to entertain people whom they liked, to write letters, to read books, in short to live in these surroundings, passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the toll-house, where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that, as from a mountain-top, the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy, I opened the window; the sound, distinctly caught, of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision. Was it not like an index of measurement which, upsetting all our ordinary impressions, shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal, in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them; and that, though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way, they are not great; that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves, the medium through which it has to pass being purer. And in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the toll-house, one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves, which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate, minute and soft precision. I said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art, in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur. I was now at the highest pitch of exaltation, which raised everything round about me accordingly. It melted my heart that the Verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station. I said as much to the Princess, who seemed to think that I was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy. I know that she admitted subsequently to Cottard that she found me very enthusiastic; he replied that I was too emotional, required sedatives and ought to take to knitting. I pointed out to the Princess every tree, every little house smothered in its mantle of roses, I made her admire everything, I would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart. She told me that she could see that I had a gift for painting, that of course I must sketch, that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it. And she confessed that the country was indeed pic-I turesque. We drove through, where it perched upon its height, the little I village of Englesqueville (Engleberti villa, Brichot informed us). \u201cBut are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening, in spite of Dechambre\u2019s death, Princess?\u201d he went on, without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cM. Verldulin insisted that it should not be put off, simply to keep his wife from thinking. And besides, after never failing for all these years to entertain on Wednesdays, such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her. Her nerves are velly bad just now. M. Verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening, because he knew that it would be a great distraction for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said the Princess, forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before. \u201cI think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Princess added. \u201cAh! I am glad you warned me,\u201d Brichot artlessly replied. \u201cI shall pass on your suggestion to Cottard.\u201d The carriage stopped for a moment. It moved on again, but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased. We had turned into the main avenue of la Raspeli\u00e8re where M. Verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps. \u201cI did well to put on a dinner-jacket,\u201d he said, observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs, \u201csince I have such smart gentlemen in my party.\u201d And as I apologised for not having changed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite all right. We\u2019re all friends here. I should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinner-jackets, but it wouldn\u2019t fit you.\u201d The handclasp throbbing with emotion which, as he entered the hall of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist, Brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter. I told him how greatly I admired the scenery. \u201cAh! All the better, and you\u2019ve seen nothing, we must take you round. Why not come and spend a week or two here, the air is excellent.\u201d Brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood. \u201cAh! Poor Dechambre!\u201d he said, but in an undertone, in case Mme. Verdurin was within earshot. \u201cIt is terrible,\u201d replied M. Verdurin lightly. \u201cSo young,\u201d Brichot pursued the point. Annoyed at being detained over these futilities, M. Verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan, not of grief but of irritated impatience: \u201cWhy yes, of course, but what\u2019s to be done about it, it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, talking about him won\u2019t bring him back to life, will it?\u201d And, his civility returning with his joviality: \u201cCome along, my good Brichot, get your things off quickly. We have a bouillabaisse which mustn\u2019t be kept waiting. But, in heaven\u2019s name, don\u2019t start talking about Dechambre to Madame Verdurin. You know that she always hides her feelings, but she is quite morbidly sensitive. I give you my word, when she heard that Dechambre was dead, she almost cried,\u201d said M. Verdurin in a tone of profound irony. One might have concluded, from hearing him speak, that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years\u2019 standing, and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of M. Verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him. \u201cIf you mention it to her, she will go and make herself ill again. It is deplorable, three weeks after her bronchitis. When that happens, it is I who have to be sick-nurse. You can understand that I have had more than enough of it. Grieve for Dechambre\u2019s fate in your heart as much as you like. Think of him, but do not speak about him. I was very fond of Dechambre, but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife. Here\u2019s Cottard, now, you can ask him.\u201d And indeed, he knew that a family doctor can do many little services, such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docile Cottard had said to the Mistress: \u201cUpset yourself like that, and to-morrow you will give me a temperature of 102,\u201d as he might have said to the cook: \u201cTo-morrow you will give me a riz de veau.\u201d Medicine, when it fails to cure the sick, busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin was glad to find that Saniette, notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier, had not deserted the little nucleus. And indeed Mme. Verdurin and her husband had acquired, in their idleness, cruel instincts for which the great occasions, occurring too rarely, no longer sufficed. They had succeeded in effecting a breach between Odette and Swann, between Brichot and his mistress. They would try it again with some one else, that was understood. But the opportunity did not present itself every day. Whereas, thanks to his shuddering sensibility, his timorous and quickly aroused shyness, Saniette provided them with a whipping-block for every day in the year. And so, for fear of his failing them, they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words, such as the bigger boys at school, the old soldiers in a regiment, address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches, with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Brichot reminded Cottard, who had not heard what M. Verdurin was saying, \u201cmum\u2019s the word before Mme. Verdurin. Have no fear, O Cottard, you are dealing with a sage, as Theocritus says. Besides, M. Verdurin is right, what is the use of lamentations,\u201d he went on, for, being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him, but having no finer perception, he had admired in M. Verdurin\u2019s remarks the most courageous stoicism. \u201cAll the same, it is a great talent that has gone from the world.\u201d \u201cWhat, are you still talking about Dechambre,\u201d said M. Verdurin, who had gone on ahead of us, and, seeing that we were not following him, had turned back. \u201cListen,\u201d he said to Brichot, \u201cnothing is gained by exaggeration. The fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius, which he was not. He played well, I admit, and what is more, he was in his proper element here; transplanted, he ceased to exist. My wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation. You know what she is. I will go farther, in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment, he is done to a turn, as the demoiselles de Caen, grilled according to the incomparable recipe of Pampilles, are going to be, I hope (unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this Kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven). You don\u2019t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because Dechambre is dead, when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert; to recover for the moment, and for the moment only, the suppleness of his wrists. Besides, you are going to hear this evening, or at any rate to meet, for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art, after dinner, for the card-table, somebody who is a far greater artist than Dechambre, a youngster whom my wife has discovered\u201d (as she had discovered Dechambre, and Paderewski, and everybody else): \u201cMorel. He has not arrived yet, the devil. He is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up, and who bores him to tears, but otherwise, not to get into trouble with his father, he would have been obliged to stay down at Donci\u00e8res and keep him company: the Baron de Charlus.\u201d The faithful entered the drawing-room. M. Verdurin, who had remained behind with me while I took off my things, took my arm by way of a joke, as one\u2019s host does at a dinner-party when there is no lady for one to take in. \u201cDid you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cYes, M. Brichot told me things which interested me greatly,\u201d said I, thinking of the etymologies, and because I had heard that the Verdurins greatly admired Brichot. \u201cI am surprised to hear that he told you anything,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201che is such a retiring man, and talks so little about the things he knows.\u201d This compliment did not strike me as being very apt. \u201cHe seems charming,\u201d I remarked. \u201cExquisite, delicious, not the sort of man you meet every day, such a light, fantastic touch, my wife adores him, and so do I!\u201d replied M. Verdurin in an exaggerated tone, as though repeating a lesson. Only then did I grasp that what he had said to me about Brichot was ironical. And I asked myself whether M. Verdurin, since those far-off days of which I had heard reports, had not shaken off the yoke of his wife\u2019s tutelage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the Verdurins were willing to have M. de Charlus in their house. Whereas in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where M. de Charlus was so well known, nobody ever referred to his morals (of which most people had no suspicion, others remained doubtful, crediting him rather with intense but Platonic friendships, with behaving imprudently, while the enlightened few strenuously denied, shrugging their shoulders, any insinuation upon which some malicious Gallardon might venture), those morals, the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends, were, on the other hand, being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved, just as, at times, the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence. Moreover, in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion, his great position in society, his noble origin were completely unknown, by a process analogous to that which, among the people of Rumania, has brought it about that the name of Ron-sard is known as that of a great nobleman, while his poetical work is unknown there. Not only that, the Rumanian estimate of Ronsard\u2019s nobility is founded upon an error. Similarly, if in the world of painters and actors M. de Charlus had such an evil reputation, that was due to their confusing him with a certain Comte Leblois de Charlus who was not even related to him (or, if so, the connexion was extremely remote), and who had been arrested, possibly by mistake, in the course of a police raid which had become historic. In short, all the stories related of our M. de Charlus referred to the other. Many professionals swore that they had had relations with M. de Charlus, and did so in good faith, believing that the false M. de Charlus was the true one, the false one possibly encouraging, partly from an affectation of nobility, partly to conceal his vice, a confusion which to the true one (the Baron whom we already know) was for a long time damaging, and afterwards, when he had begun to go down the hill, became a convenience, for it enabled him likewise to say: \u201cThat is not myself.\u201d And in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred. Finally, what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact (the Baron\u2019s tendencies), he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who, in the theatrical world, had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved. When they were seen together at a first night, people would say: \u201cYou see,\u201d just as it was supposed that the Duchesse de Guermantes had immoral relations with the Princesse de Parme; an indestructible legend, for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves, to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall. Given M. de Charlus\u2019s morals, the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the Baron\u2019s social position must be equally low, since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged, his title or his name. Just as Cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of Doctor of Medicine implied nothing, the title of Consultant to a Hospital meant something, so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twenty-five louis, and regained his importance only in the Faubourg Saint-Germain where he had three sisters who were Duchesses, for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account, but among the smart people who know what is what, that the great nobleman creates an effect. M. de Charlus, for that matter, was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain that the Verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so \u2018select\u2019 a household as theirs, the sculptor felt it his duty to take the Mistress aside. \u201cYou are entirely mistaken, besides I never pay any attention to those tales, and even if it were true, I may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, furious, for Morel being the principal feature of the Wednesdays, the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him. As for Cottard, he could not express an opinion, for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to \u2018do a little job\u2019 in thebuen retiro, and after that, in M. Verdurin\u2019s bedroom, to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great publisher from Paris who had come to call, expecting to be invited to stay to dinner, withdrew abruptly, quickly, realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan. He was a tall, stout man, very dark, with a studious and somewhat cutting air. He reminded one of an ebony paper-knife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin who, to welcome us in her immense drawing-room, in which displays of grasses, poppies, field-flowers, plucked only that morning, alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls, two centuries earlier, by an artist of exquisite taste, had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend, begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game, talking to us the while. What I told her about my impressions did not, however, seem altogether to please her. For one thing I was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff, and finer still from the terrace of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and which I would have travelled miles to see. \u201cYes, it\u2019s incomparable,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin carelessly, with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass. \u201cEven though we have it always in front of us, we never grow tired of it,\u201d and she turned her attention back to her cards. Now my very enthusiasm made me exacting. I expressed my regret that I could not see from the drawing-room the rocks of Darnetal, which, Elstir had told me, were quite lovely at that hour, when they reflected so many colours. \u201cAh! You can\u2019t see them from here, you would have to go to the end of the park, to the \u2018view of the bay.\u2019 From the seat there, you can take in the whole panorama. But you can\u2019t go there by yourself, you will lose your way. I can take you there, if you like,\u201d she added kindly. \u201cNo, no, you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day, you want to make yourself ill again. He will come back, he can see the view of the bay another time.\u201d I did not insist, and understood that it was enough for the Verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawing-room or dining-room, like a magnificent painting, like a priceless Japanese enamel, justifying the high rent that they were paying for la Raspeli\u00e8re, with plate and linen, but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes; the important thing, here, for them was to live comfortably, to take drives, to feed well, to talk, to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards, good meals, merry tea-parties. I noticed, however, later on, how intelligently they had learned to know the district, taking their guests for excursions as \u2018novel\u2019 as the music to which they made them listen. The part which the flowers of la Raspeli\u00e8re, the roads by the sea\u2019s edge, the old houses, the undiscovered churches, played in the life of M. Verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in Paris and who, themselves, substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life, or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes. This importance was further enhanced by the fact that the Verdurins were convinced that la Raspeli\u00e8re, which they hoped to purchase, was a property without its match in the world. This superiority which their self-esteem made them attribute to la Raspeli\u00e8re justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which, but for that, would have annoyed them slightly, because of the disappointments which it involved (like my disappointment when long ago I had first listened to Berma) and which I frankly admitted to them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear the carriage coming back,\u201d the Mistress suddenly murmured. Let us state briefly that Mme. Verdurin, quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years, no longer resembled what she had been at the time when Swann and Odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house. Even when she heard it played, she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then, for that had become her normal expression. Under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of Bach, Wagner, Vinteuil, Debussy had given her, Mme. Verdurin\u2019s brow had assumed enormous proportions, like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism. Her temples, suggestive of a pair of beautiful, pain-stricken, milk-white spheres, in which Harmony rolled endlessly, flung back upon either side her silvered tresses, and proclaimed, on the Mistress\u2019s behalf, without any need for her to say a word: \u201cI know what is in store for me to-night.\u201d Her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence, for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb. This attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by Beauty, and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata, had the result that Mme. Verdurin, even when listening to the most heartrending music, preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance, and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, here they are!\u201d M. Verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit Morel, followed by M. de Charlus. The latter, to whom dining with the Verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings, was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress. Moreover the persistent desire that M. de Charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome (when he appeared in the open doorway) by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious. When it is a Charlus, whether he be noble or plebeian, that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers, it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex, attendant like a goddess, or incarnate as a double, that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawing-room and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess. Thus a young painter, brought up by a godly, Protestant, female cousin, will enter a room, his head aslant and quivering, his eyes raised to the ceiling, his hands gripping an invisible muff, the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawing-room. Thus it was that the pious relative, whose memory is helping him to-day, used to enter a room years ago, and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce, when from her first words one realised, as now in the case of the painter, that she had come to pay an after-dinner call. By virtue of the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilise, adulterate, in a perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past, and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect, the one of Mme. Cottard\u2019s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune, radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain, it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex. He walked upon tiptoe, was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase, offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers, and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain, albeit he was bare-headed, whether his hat, as Mme. Cottard had once inquired of Swann, was not askew. As for M. de Charlus, whom the society in which he had lived furnished, at this critical moment, with different examples, with other patterns of affability, and above all with the maxim that one must, in certain cases, when dealing with people of humble rank, bring into play and make use of one\u2019s rarest graces, which one normally holds in reserve, it was with a flutter, archly, and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon Mme. Verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour. One would have thought that it was Mme. de Marsantes who was entering the room, so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of Nature had enshrined in the body of M. de Charlus. It was true that the Baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance. But no sooner had he succeeded than, he having in the meantime kept the same tastes, this habit of looking at things through a woman\u2019s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance, due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living. And as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view, and without noticing it, for it is not only by dint of lying to other people, but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying, albeit he had called upon his body to manifest (at the moment of his entering the Verdurins\u2019 drawing-room) all the courtesy of a great nobleman, that body which had fully understood what M. de Charlus had ceased to apprehend, displayed, to such an extent that the Baron would have deserved the epithet \u2018ladylike,\u2019 all the attractions of a great lady. Not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of M. de Charlus and the fact that sons, who do not always take after their fathers, even without being inverts, and though they go after women, may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers. But we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself: the Profanation of the Mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of M. de Charlus, and purely physical ferments set his material substance \u2018working\u2019 and made his body pass gradually into the category of women\u2019s bodies, nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin. By dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill, grow thin, are too weak to rise from your bed, suffer from nervous enteritis. By dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman, and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements. The obsession, just as in the other instance it affects your health, may in this instance alter your sex. Morel, who accompanied him, came to shake hands with me. From that first moment, owing to a twofold change that occurred in him I formed (alas, I was not warned in time to act upon it!) a bad impression of him. I have said that Morel, having risen above his father\u2019s menial status, was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity. He had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as Monsieur, treating me as an inferior. What was my surprise at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s to see him bow very low before me, and before me alone, and to hear, before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else, words of respect, most respectful \u2014 such words as I thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips \u2014 addressed to myself. I at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me. Taking me aside a minute later: \u201cMonsieur would be doing me a very great service,\u201d he said to me, going so far this time as to address me in the third person, \u201cby keeping from Mme. Verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle. It would be best to say that he was, in your family, the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents,\u201d Morel\u2019s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father\u2019s position, in which I took not the slightest interest, but the wealth \u2014 the apparent wealth of my own, which I felt to be absurd. But he appeared so unhappy, so pressing, that I could not refuse him. \u201cNo, before dinner,\u201d he said in an imploring tone, \u201cMonsieur can easily find some excuse for taking Mme. Verdurin aside.\u201d This was what, in the end, I did, trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of Morel\u2019s father, without unduly exaggerating the \u2018style,\u2019 the \u2018worldly goods\u2019 of my own family. It went like a letter through the post, notwithstanding the astonishment of Mme. Verdurin, who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather. And as she had no tact, hated family life (that dissolvent of the little nucleus), after telling me that she remembered, long ago, seeing my great-grandfather, and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot, who would have been incapable of understanding the little group, and who, to use her expression, \u201cwas not one of us,\u201d she said to me: \u201cFamilies are such a bore, the only thing is to get right away from them;\u201d and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my great-grandfather\u2019s character of which I was unaware, although I might have suspected it at home (I had never seen him, but they frequently spoke of him), his remarkable stinginess (in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my great-uncle, the friend of the lady in pink and Morel\u2019s father\u2019s employer): \u201cWhy, of course, if your grandparents had such a grand agent, that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family. Your grandfather\u2019s father was so stingy that, at the end of his life, when he was almost half-witted \u2014 between you and me, he was never anything very special, you are worth the whole lot of them \u2014 he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus. So that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him, and to let the old miser think that his friend M. de Persigny, the Cabinet Minister, had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses. But I am delighted to hear that our Morel\u2019s father held such a good position. I was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster, but that\u2019s nothing, I must have misunderstood. In any case, it makes not the slightest difference, for I must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth, the personal contribution, what I call the participation. Provided that a person is artistic, provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood, nothing else matters.\u201d The way in which Morel was one of the brotherhood was \u2014 so far as I have been able to discover \u2014 that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other. But what it is essential to note here is that as soon as I had given him my word that I would speak on his behalf to Mme. Verdurin, as soon, moreover, as I had actually done so, and without any possibility of subsequent retractation, Morel\u2019s \u2018respect\u2019 for myself vanished as though by magic, the formal language of respect melted away, and indeed for some time he avoided me, contriving to appear contemptuous of me, so that if Mme. Verdurin wanted me to give him a message, to ask him to play something, he would continue to talk to one of the faithful, then move on to another, changing his seat if I approached him. The others were obliged to tell him three or four times that I had spoken to him, after which he would reply, with an air of constraint, briefly, that is to say unless we were by ourselves. When that happened, he was expansive, friendly, for there was a charming side to him. I concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature, that he would not, at a pinch, shrink from any act of meanness, was incapable of gratitude. In which he resembled the majority of mankind. But inasmuch as I had inherited a strain of my grandmother\u2019s nature, and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did, I overlooked his baseness, rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence, and indeed in what I believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when, having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature, he realised (with a jerk, for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery) that my kindness to him was disinterested, that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness; and, more important still, I was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity, but which made me (without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician) hear again or for the first time so much good music. Moreover a manager \u2014 M. de Charlus (whom I had not suspected of such talents, albeit Mme. de Guermantes, who had known him a very different person in their younger days, asserted that he had composed a sonata for her, painted a fan, and so forth), modest in regard to his true merits, but possessing talents of the first order, contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold. Imagine a merely skilful performer in the Russian ballet, formed, educated, developed in all directions by M. Diaghileff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had just given Mme. Verdurin the message with which Morel had charged me and was talking to M. de Charlus about Saint-Loup, when Cottard burst into the room announcing, as though the house were on fire, that the Cambremers had arrived. Mme. Verdurin, not wishing to appear before strangers such as M. de Charlus (whom Cottard had not seen) and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the Cambremers, did not move, made no response to the announcement of these tidings, and merely said to the doctor, fanning herself gracefully, and adopting the tone of a Marquise in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cThe Baron has just been telling us. . . . \u201d This was too much for Cottard! Less abruptly than he would have done in the old days, for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance, but with the emotion, nevertheless, which he recaptured at the Verdurins\u2019, he exclaimed: \u201cA Baron! What Baron? Where\u2019s the Baron?\u201d staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity. Mme. Verdurin, with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has, in front of her guests, broken a valuable glass, and with the artificial, highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prize-winner acting in a play by the younger Dumas, replied, pointing with her fan to Morel\u2019s patron: \u201cWhy, the Baron de Charlus, to whom let me introduce you, M. le Professeur Cottard.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was, for that matter, by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady. M. de Charlus proffered two fingers which the Professor clasped with the kindly smile of a \u2018Prince of Science.\u2019 But he stopped short upon seeing the Cambremers enter the room, while M. de Charlus led me into a corner to tell me something, not without feeling my muscles, which is a German habit. M. de Cambremer bore no resemblance to the old Marquise. To anyone who had only heard of him, or of letters written by him, well and forcibly expressed, his personal appearance was startling. No doubt, one would grow accustomed to it. But his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth, perhaps the only crooked line, among so many, which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face, and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity, aggravated still further by the proximity of a Norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples. It is possible that the eyes of M. de Cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the Cotentin, so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching, drawn up by the roadside, and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars, but those eyelids, heavy, bleared and drooping, would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping. And so, discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance, one returned to the big crooked nose. By a transposition of the senses, M. de Cambremer looked at you with his nose. This nose of his was not ugly, it was if anything too handsome, too bold, too proud of its own importance. Arched, polished, gleaming, brand new, it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes. Unfortunately, if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed, the nose (to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest), the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propriety of the dark clothes which M. de Cambremer invariably wore, even in the morning, might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know; still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate\u2019s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority, as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of Alen\u00e7on, that on seeing M. de Cambremer one immediately felt oneself, even before one knew who he was, in the presence of a man of supreme distinction, of a man of perfect breeding, a change from the sort of person one saw at Balbec, a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely. He was to her, stifled by all those Balbec tourists who did not know her world, like a bottle of smelling salts. It seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as \u2018all wrong,\u2019 and that, as she had no conception of snobbishness, she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of Mlle. Legrandin, who must surely be difficult to please, having a brother who was \u2018so refined.\u2019 At best one might have said of M. de Cambremer\u2019s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition; one was reminded, on examining his faulty features, which one would have liked to correct, of those names of little Norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the cur\u00e9 was mistaken because the peasants, mispronouncing the names, or having misunderstood the Latin or Norman words that underlay them, have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies, as Brichot would have said, a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation. Life in these old towns may, for all that, be pleasant enough, and M. de Cambremer must have had his good points, for if it was in a mother\u2019s nature that the old Marquise should prefer her son to her daughter-in-law, on the other hand, she, who had other children, of whom two at least were not devoid of merit, was often heard to declare that the Marquis was, in her opinion, the best of the family. During the short time he had spent in the army, his messmates, finding Cambremer too long a name to pronounce, had given him the nickname Cancan, implying a flow of chatter, which he in no way merited. He knew how to brighten a dinner-party to which he was invited by saying when the fish (even if it were stale) or the entr\u00e9e came in: \u201cI say, that looks a fine animal.\u201d And his wife, who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs, put herself on the level of her husband\u2019s friends and perhaps sought to please him, like a mistress, and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence, by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers: \u201cYou shall see Cancan presently. Cancan has gone to Balbec, but he will be back this evening.\u201d She was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the Verdurins\u2019 and had done so only upon the entreaties of her mother-in-law and husband, in the hope of renewing the lease. But, being less well-bred than they, she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinner-party to her women friends. \u201cYou know we are going to dine with our tenants. That will be well worth an increased rent. As a matter of fact, I am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la Raspeli\u00e8re\u201d (as though she had been born in the house, and would find there all her old family associations). \u201cOur old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn\u2019t know the place. I can\u2019t bear to think of all that must be going on there. I am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again.\u201d She arrived haughty and morose, with the air of a great lady whose castle, owing to a state of war, is occupied by the enemy, but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding. Mme. de Cambremer could not see me at first for I was in a bay at the side of the room with M. de Charlus, who was telling me that he had heard from Morel that Morel\u2019s father had been an \u2018agent\u2019 in my family, and that he, Charlus, credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity (a term common to himself and Swann) to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots (I was warned) would not have failed, in my place, to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory. \u201cThe mere fact that I take an interest in him and extend my protection over him, gives him a pre-eminence and wipes out the past,\u201d the Baron concluded. As I listened to him and promised the silence which I would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous, I was looking at Mme. de Cambremer. And I had difficulty in recognising the melting, savoury morsel which I had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime, on the terrace at Balbec, in the Norman rock-cake that I now saw, hard as a rock, in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth. Irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother\u2019s simple kindliness, which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him, anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society, when Brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted, as she had seen her more fashionable friends do, but, anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world, she said, not, as she ought to have said: \u201cAllow me to introduce my husband,\u201d but: \u201cI introduce you to my husband,\u201d holding aloft thus the banner of the Cambremers, without avail, for her husband bowed as low before Brichot as she had expected. But all Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on M. de Charlus, whom she knew by sight. Never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction, even at the time of her intimacy with Swann. For as M. de Charlus always sided with the woman, with his sister-in-law against M. de Guermantes\u2019s mistresses, with Odette, at that time still unmarried, but an old flame of Swann\u2019s, against the new, he had, as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes, given Odette \u2014 and kept \u2014 the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to Mme. de Cambremer. She had certainly never guessed that it was at the Verdurins\u2019 that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person. M. de Cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her, so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied: \u201cYou are glad now you decided to come, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke very little, knowing that he had married a superior woman. \u201cI, all unworthy,\u201d he would say at every moment, and spontaneously quoted a fable of La Fontaine and one of Florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance, and at the same time enable him, beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery, to shew the men of science who were not members of the Jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables. The unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them. And so they kept cropping up. Mme. de Cambremer was no fool, but she had a number of extremely irritating habits. With her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain. She was not the person to say, like the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than Mme. de Cambremer from such an absurdity), with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name (albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach) of Julien de Monch\u00e2teau: \u201ca little Madame . . . Pica della Mirandola.\u201d No, when Mme. de Cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart, so as not to appear to know some damaging fact, and when, in her sincerity, she admitted it, she tried to conceal it by altering it. If, for instance, she was defending a woman, she would try to conceal the fact, while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth, that Madame So-and-so was at the moment the mistress of M. Sylvain Levy, and would say: \u201cNo . . . I know absolutely nothing about her, I fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name I don\u2019t know, something like Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn; anyhow, I believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them.\u201d This is an analogous, but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man, their listener will not immediately see that the expression (like her Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn) is interpolated, is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation, has a double meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin whispered in her husband\u2019s ear: \u201cShall I offer my arm to the Baron de Charlus? As you will have Mme. de Cambremer on your right, we might divide the honours.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201csince the other is higher in rank\u201d (meaning that M. de Cambremer was a Marquis), \u201cM. de Charlus is, strictly speaking, his inferior.\u201d \u201cVery well, I shall put him beside the Princess.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin introduced Mme. Sherbatoff to M. de Charlus; each of them bowed in silence, with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy. M. Verdurin introduced me to M. de Cambremer. Before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice, his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says: \u201cI have heard about you, I shall see what can be done; your punishment shall be remitted; we don\u2019t thirst for blood here; it will be all right.\u201d Then, as he shook my hand: \u201cI think you know my mother,\u201d he said to me. The word \u2018think\u2019 seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting, but not to imply any uncertainty, for he went on: \u201cI have a note for you from her.\u201d M. de Cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long. \u201cI am at home again,\u201d he said to Mme. Verdurin, while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors, and the marble busts on their high pedestals. He might, all the same, have felt himself at sea, for Mme. Verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own. In this respect, Mme. Verdurin, while regarded by the Cambremers as having turned everything upside down, was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand. They were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush, like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap, and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the Place Saint-Sulpice. Furthermore, a herb garden was beginning to take the place, in front of the mansion, of the borders that were the pride not merely of the Cambremers but of their gardener. The latter, who regarded the Cambremers as his sole masters, and groaned beneath the yoke of the Verdurins, as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army, went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress, grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias, begonias, house-leeks, double dahlias, and at anyone\u2019s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair. Mme. Verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind, if she took a long lease of la Raspeli\u00e8re or even bought the place, to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener, by whom his old mistress, on the contrary, set great store. He had worked for her without payment, when times were bad, he adored her; but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders, among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration, which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges, he used often to say of Mme. de Cambremer who, in \u201870, in a house that she owned in the East of France, surprised by the invasion, had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the Germans: \u201cWhat many people can\u2019t forgive Mme. la Marquise is that during the war she took the side of the Prussians and even had them to stay in her house. At any other time, I could understand it; but in war time, she ought not to have done it. It is not right.\u201d So that he was faithful to her unto death, venerated her for her goodness, and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason. Mme. Verdurin was annoyed that M. de Cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cYou must notice a good many changes, all the same,\u201d she replied. \u201cFor one thing there were those big bronze Barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which I packed off at once to the attic, though even that is too good a place for them.\u201d After this bitter retort to M. de Cambremer, she offered him her arm to go in to dinner. He hesitated for a moment, saying to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t, really, go in before M. de Charlus.\u201d But supposing the other to be an old friend of the house, seeing that he was not set in the post of honour, he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told Mme. Verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium (so it was that he styled the little nucleus, not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term). Cottard, who was seated next to M. de Charlus, beamed at him through his glass, to make his acquaintance and to break the ice, with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days, and not interrupted by fits of shyness. And these engaging glances, enhanced by the smile that accompanied them, were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides. The Baron, who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere, had no doubt that Cottard was one, and was making eyes at him. At once he turned on the Professor the cold shoulder of the invert, as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him. No doubt, albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure, always refused him by destiny, of being loved, it is a general law, the application of which is by no means confined to the Charlus type, that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable. To such a person, to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us, we prefer the society of any other, who has neither her charm, nor her looks, nor her brains. She will recover these, in our estimation, only when she has ceased to love us. In this light, we might see only the transposition, into odd terms, of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him. And so, whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels, the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it, as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman, M. de Charlus for instance by the Princesse de Guermantes, whose passion for him bored him, but flattered him. But when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them, then, whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own, or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking, which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it, is regarded as a vice, or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing, or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another, or from rage at being subjected, by the equivocal attitude of another person, to the injury which, by their own attitude, if that other person attracted them, they would not be afraid to inflict on him, the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles, never taking their eyes off him in the theatre, even if he is with friends, and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them, may be heard, if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them, to say: \u201cSir, for what do you take me?\u201d (simply because he takes them for what they are) \u201cI don\u2019t understand, no, don\u2019t attempt to explain, you are quite mistaken,\u201d pass if need be from words to blows, and, to a person who knows the imprudent stranger, wax indignant: \u201cWhat, you know that loathsome creature. He stares at one so! . . . A fine way to behave!\u201d M. de Charlus did not go quite as far as this, but assumed the offended, glacial air adopted, when one appears to be suspecting them, by women who are not of easy virtue, even more by women who are. Furthermore, the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which, being purely inanimate, could at the worst only injure his self-esteem, but a second self, living, acting in the same sphere, capable therefore of injuring him in his loves. And so it is from an instinct of self-preservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival, whether to people who are able to do him some injury (nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case), or to the young man whom he has \u2018picked up,\u2019 who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person. To M. de Charlus, who was thinking perhaps of the \u2014 wholly imaginary \u2014 dangers in which the presence of this Cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve Morel, an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself, but was a deliberate rival. A tradesman, practising an uncommon trade, who, on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that, in the same square, directly opposite, the same trade is being carried on by a competitor, is no more discomfited than a Charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and, on the day of his arrival, catches sight of the local squire or the barber, whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt. The tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred; this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy, and, if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity, one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place. The invert\u2019s rage is even more agonising. He has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion. Even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him, he is obliged, like Harpagon, to watch over his treasure, and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen. And it is this no doubt that, even more than desire, or the convenience of habits shared in common, and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience, makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible. He may be mistaken for a moment, but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth. And so M. de Charlus\u2019s error was brief. His divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that Cottard was not of his kind, and that he need not fear his advances either for himself, which would merely have annoyed him, or for Morel, which would have seemed to him a more serious matter. He recovered his calm, and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of Venus Androgyne, now and again, he smiled a faint smile at the Verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth, merely curving his lips at one corner, and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes, he so obsessed with virility, exactly as his sister-in-law the Duchesse de Guermantes might have done. \u201cDo you shoot much, Sir?\u201d said M. Verdurin with a note of contempt to M. de Cambremer. \u201cHas Ski told you of the near shave we had to-day?\u201d Cottard inquired of the mistress. \u201cI shoot mostly in the forest of Chantepie,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cNo, I have told her nothing,\u201d said Ski. \u201cDoes it deserve its name?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Cambremer, after a glance at me from the corner of his eye, for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations, begging me at the same time not to let the Cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the Combray cur\u00e9. \u201cI am afraid I must be very stupid, but I don\u2019t grasp your question,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cI mean to say: do many pies sing in it?\u201d replied Brichot. Cottard meanwhile could not bear Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train. \u201cOut with it,\u201d Mme. Cottard said to her husband encouragingly, \u201ctell us your odyssey.\u201d \u201cWell, really, it is quite out of the Ordinary,\u201d said the doctor, and repeated his narrative from the beginning. \u201cWhen I saw that the train was in the station, I stood thunderstruck. It was all Ski\u2019s fault. You are somewhat wide of the mark in your information, my dear fellow! And there was Brichot waiting for us at the station!\u201d \u201cI assumed,\u201d said the scholar, casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips, \u201cthat if you had been detained at Graincourt, it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue, if my wife were to hear you!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis wife of mine, it is jealous.\u201d \u201cAh! That Brichot,\u201d cried Ski, moved to traditional merriment by Brichot\u2019s spicy witticism, \u201che is always the same;\u201d albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity. And, to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture, he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch Brichot\u2019s leg. \u201cHe never changes, the rascal,\u201d Ski went on, and without stopping to think of the effect, at once tragic and comic, that the don\u2019s semi-blindness gave to his words: \u201cAlways a sharp look-out for the ladies.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, \u201cwhat it is to meet with a scholar. Here have I been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of Chantepie, and I\u2019ve never even thought of what the name meant.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband; she did not like him to humble himself thus before Brichot. She was even more annoyed when, at every \u2018ready-made\u2019 expression that Cancan employed, Cottard, who knew the ins and outs of them all, having himself laboriously acquired them, pointed out to the Marquis, who admitted his stupidity, that they meant nothing. \u201cWhy \u2018stupid as a cabbage?\u2019 Do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else? You say:\u2018repeat the same thing thirty-six times.\u2019 Why thirty-six? Why do you say:\u2018sleep like a top?\u2019 Why \u2018Thunder of Brest?\u2019 Why \u2018play four hundred tricks?\u2019\u201d But at this, the defence of M. de Cambremer was taken up by Brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions. But Mme. de Cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the Verdurins had introduced at la Raspeli\u00e8re, in order that she might be able to criticise some, and import others, or possibly the same ones, to F\u00e9terne. \u201cI keep wondering what that lustre is that\u2019s hanging all crooked. I can hardly recognise my old Raspeli\u00e8re,\u201d she went on, with a familiarly aristocratic air, as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle. And, as she was a trifle bookish in her speech: \u201cAll the same,\u201d she added in an undertone, \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that if I were inhabiting another person\u2019s house, I should feel some compunction about altering everything like this.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity you didn\u2019t come with them,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to M. de Charlus and Morel, hoping that M. de Charlus was now \u2018enrolled\u2019 and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train. \u201cYou are sure that Chantepie means the singing magpie, Chochotte?\u201d she went on, to shew that, like the great hostess that she was, she could join in every conversation at the same time. \u201cTell me something about this violinist,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me, \u201che interests me; I adore music, and it seems to me that I have heard of him before, complete my education.\u201d She had heard that Morel had come with M. de Charlus and hoped, by getting the former to come to her house, to make friends with the latter. She added, however, so that I might not guess her reason for asking, \u201cM. Brichot, too, interests me.\u201d For, even if she was highly cultivated, just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything, and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter, so Mme. de Cambremer might in vain master, and especially at F\u00e9terne, a philosophy that became ever more esoteric, music that became ever more subtle, she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middle-class friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her \u2018in laws,\u2019 and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote. A philosopher who was not modern enough for her, Leibnitz, has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart. This way Mme. de Cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing. Abandoning the study of John Stuart Mill only for that of Lachelier, the less she believed in the reality of the external world, the more desperately she sought to establish herself, before she died, in a good position in it. In her passion for realism in art, no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer. A fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick; Tolstoi\u2019s mujiks, or Millet\u2019s peasants, were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass. But to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations, to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with Duchesses, this was the goal of all her efforts, so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself, by the study of great masterpieces, proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her. This snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined, just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies. I could not, all the same, refrain, as I listened to her, from giving her credit, without deriving any pleasure from them, for the refinement of her expressions. They were those that are used, at a given date, by all the people of the same intellectual breadth, so that the refined expression provides us at once, like the arc of a circle, with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference. And so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately, because I feel that I already know them, but are generally regarded as superior persons, and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions. \u201cYou cannot fail to be aware, Madame, that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them. Next to the forest of Chantepie, you have the wood Chantereine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who the queen may be, but you are not very polite to her,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cOne for you, Chochotte,\u201d said Mme. de Verdurin. \u201cAnd apart from that, did you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cWe encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train. But I must answer M. de Cambremer\u2019s question; reine, in this instance, is not the wife of a king, but a frog. It is the name that the frog has long retained in this district, as is shewn by the station, Renneville, which ought to be spelt Reineville.\u201d \u201cI say, that seems a fine animal,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin, pointing to a fish. (It was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinner-party, and gave an immediate return of hospitality. \u201cThere is no need to invite them,\u201d he would often say, in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife. \u201cThey were delighted to have us. It was they that thanked me for coming.\u201d) \u201cI must tell you, all the same, that I have been going every day for years to Renneville, and I have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else. Madame de Cambremer brought the cur\u00e9 here from a parish where she owns a considerable property, who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself, it seems to me. He has written a book.\u201d \u201cI know, I have read it with immense interest,\u201d Brichot replied hypocritically. The satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made M. de Cambremer laugh long and loud. \u201cAh! well, the author of, what shall I say, this geography, this glossary, dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly, if I may say so, the Lords, and which is called Pont-a-Couleuvre. Of course I am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning, but I have been to Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre a thousand times if he\u2019s been there once, and devil take me if I ever saw one of his beastly serpents there, I say beastly, in spite of the tribute the worthy La Fontaine pays them.\u201d (The Man and the Serpent was one of his two fables.) \u201cYou have not seen any, and you have been quite right,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cUndoubtedly, the writer you mention knows his subject through and through, he has written a remarkable book.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cthat book, there\u2019s no other word for it, is a regular Benedictine opus.\u201d \u201cNo doubt he has consulted various polyptychs (by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese), which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators. But there are other sources. One of the most learned of my friends has delved into them. He found that the place in question was named Pont-a-Quileuvre. This odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther, to a Latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled Pons cui aperit: A closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment.\u201d \u201cYou were speaking of frogs. I, when I find myself among such learned folk, feel like the frog before the areopagus,\u201d (this being his other fable) said Cancan who often indulged, with a hearty laugh, in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making, at one and the same time, out of humility and with aptness, a profession of ignorance and a display of learning. As for Cottard, blocked upon one side by M. de Charlus\u2019s silence, and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere, he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies; if on the other hand it missed the mark, it enabled him to check certain theories, to widen his previous point of view. \u201cWhen you come to a relatively high altitude, such as this where we now are, do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits?\u201d he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge. M. de Cambremer heard the question and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amused I am to hear that you have choking fits,\u201d he flung at me across the table. He did not mean that it made him happy, though as a matter of fact it did. For this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person\u2019s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart. But his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause my sister has them too.\u201d And indeed it did amuse him, as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house. \u201cHow small the world is,\u201d was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which I saw written upon his smiling face when Cottard spoke to me of my choking fits. And these began to establish themselves, from the evening of this dinner-party, as a sort of interest in common, after which M. de Cambremer never failed to inquire, if only to hand on a report to his sister. As I answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about Morel, my thoughts returned to a conversation I had had with my mother that afternoon. Having, without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the Verdurins\u2019 if there was a chance of my being amused there, suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved, which would have made him exclaim: \u201cOn guard!\u201d my mother had gone on to say: \u201cListen, Judge Toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with Mme. Bon-temps. They asked me no questions. But I seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to Albertine would be the joy of her aunt\u2019s life. I think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you. At the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her, the sort of friends they more or less know that we have, all that is not, I fancy, left out of account, although it may be a minor consideration. I should not have mentioned it to you myself, because I attach no importance to it, but as I imagine that people will mention it to you, I prefer to get a word in first.\u201d \u201cBut you yourself, what do you think of her?\u201d I asked my mother. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not I that am going to marry her. You might certainly do a thousand times better. But I feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you. As a matter of fact, I cannot tell you what I think of Albertine; I don\u2019t think of her. I shall say to you, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u2018She has good qualities, at least I suppose so. But at this first stage I can praise her only by negatives. One thing she is not, she has not the Rennes accent. In time, I shall perhaps say, she is something else. And I shall always think well of her if she can make you happy.\u2019\u201d But by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness, my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which I had been plunged long ago when, my father having allowed me to go to Ph\u00e8dre and, what was more, to take to writing, I had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility, the fear of distressing him, and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer, to begin by regarding Albertine as in the past, so as to find out whether I really loved her. I might take her, as a distraction, to see the Verdurins, and this thought reminded me that I had come there myself that evening only to learn whether Mme. Putbus was staying there or was expected. In any case, she was not dining with them. \u201cSpeaking of your friend Saint-Loup,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose, for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the Guermantes; \u201cyou know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the Princesse de Guermantes. I may tell you that, so far as I am concerned, all that society gossip leaves me cold.\u201d I was seized by a fear that I might have spoken unfeelingly to Robert about the girl in question, a girl full of sham originality, whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent. Hardly ever do we hear anything that does \u2018not make us regret something that we have said. I replied to Mme. de Cambremer, truthfully as it happened, that I knew nothing about it, and that anyhow I thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged. \u201cThat is perhaps why it is not yet official, anyhow there is a lot of talk about it.\u201d \u201cI ought to warn you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin observed dryly to Mme. de Cambremer, having heard her talking to me about Morel and supposing, when Mme. de Cambremer lowered her voice to speak of Saint-Loup\u2019s engagement, that Morel was still under discussion. \u201cYou needn\u2019t expect any light music here. In matters of art, you know, the faithful who come to my Wednesdays, my children as I call them, are all fearfully advanced,\u201d she added with an air of proud terror. \u201cI say to them sometimes: My dear people, you move too fast for your Mistress, not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring. Every year it goes a little farther; I can see the day coming when they will have no more use for Wagner or Indy.\u201d \u201cBut it is splendid to be advanced, one can never be advanced enough,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the dining-room, trying to identify the things that her mother-in-law had left there, those that Mme. Verdurin had brought with her, and to convict the latter red-handed of want of taste. At the same time, she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most, M. de Charlus. She thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist. \u201cHe seems intelligent.\u201d \u201cWhy, his mind is extremely active for a man of his age,\u201d said I. \u201cAge? But he doesn\u2019t seem at all old, look, the hair is still young.\u201d (For, during the last three or four years, the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions, and everybody at the same radius from the centre as Mme. de Cambremer would say \u2018the hair,\u2019 not without an affected smile. At the present day, people still say \u2018the hair\u2019 but, from an excessive use of the article, the pronoun will be born again.) \u201cWhat interests me most about M. de Charlus,\u201d she went on, \u201cis that one can feel that he has the gift. I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. Things that can be learned do not interest me.\u201d This speech was not incompatible with Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s own distinction which was, in the fullest sense, imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme. de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. \u201cThat is why,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cBrichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition, interests me far less.\u201d But Brichot, at that moment, was occupied with one thing only; hearing people talk about music, he trembled lest the subject should remind Mme. Verdurin of the death of Dechambre. He decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory. M. de Cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question: \u201cYou mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Brichot, proud to display his learning before so many strangers, among whom, I had told him, he would be certain to interest one at least. \u201cWe have only to consider how often, even in the names of people, a tree is preserved, like a fern in a piece of coal. One of our Conscript Fathers is called M. de Saulces de Freycinet, which means, if I be not mistaken, a spot planted with willows and ashes, salix et fraxinetum; his nephew M. de Selves combines more trees still, since he is named de Selves, de sylvis.\u201d Saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn. He could, since Brichot was talking all the time, preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of M. and Mme. Verdurin\u2019s wit. And growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free, he had been touched when he heard M. Verdurin, notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinner-party, tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of M. Saniette who never drank anything else. (The generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed.) Moreover, Mme. Verdurin had actually smiled once at Saniette. Decidedly, they were kind people. He was not going to be tortured any more. At this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom I have forgotten to mention, an eminent Norwegian philosopher who spoke French very well but very slowly, for the twofold reason that, in the first place, having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes (he did, nevertheless, make some), he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary, and secondly, being a metaphysician, he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it, which, even in a Frenchman, causes slowness of utterance. He was, otherwise, a charming person, although similar in appearance to many other people, save in one respect. This man so slow in his diction (there was an interval of silence after every word) acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said good-bye. His haste made one suppose, the first time one saw him, that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear \u2014 colleague,\u201d he said to Brichot, after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term, \u201cI have a sort of \u2014 desire to know whether there are other trees in the \u2014 nomenclature of your beautiful French \u2014 Latin \u2014 Norman tongue. Madame\u201d (lie meant Madame Verdurin, although he dared not look at her) \u201chas told me that you know everything. Is not this precisely the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, it is the moment for eating,\u201d interrupted Mme. Verdurin, who saw the dinner becoming interminable. \u201cVery well,\u201d the Scandinavian replied, bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile. \u201cBut I must point out to Madame that if I have permitted myself this questionnaire \u2014 pardon me, this questation \u2014 it is because I have to return to-morrow to Paris to dine at the Tour d\u2019Argent or at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, My French \u2014 brother \u2014 M. Boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism \u2014 pardon me, certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled.\u201d \u201cThe Tour d\u2019Argent is not nearly as good as they make out,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin sourly. \u201cIn fact, I have had some disgusting dinners there.\u201d \u201cBut am I mistaken, is not the food that one consumes at Madame\u2019s table an example of the finest French cookery?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not positively bad,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, sweetening. \u201cAnd if you come next Wednesday, it will be better.\u201d \u201cBut I am leaving on Monday for Algiers, and from there I am going to the Cape. And when I am at the Cape of Good Hope, I shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague \u2014 pardon me, I shall no longer be able to meet my brother.\u201d And he set to work obediently, after offering these retrospective apologies, to devour his food at a headlong pace. But Brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies, and replied, so greatly interesting the Norwegian that he again stopped eating, but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course. \u201cOne of the Forty,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cis named Houssaye, or a place planted with hollies; in the name of a brilliant diplomat, d\u2019Ormesson, you will find the elm, theulmus beloved of Virgil, which has given its name to the town of Ulm; in the names of his colleagues, M. de la Boulaye, the birch (bouleau), M. d\u2019Aunay, the alder (aune), M. de Buissi\u00e8re, the box (buis), M. Albaret, the sapwood (aubier)\u201d (I made a mental note that I must tell this to C\u00e9leste), \u201cM. de Cholet, the cabbage (chou), and the apple-tree (pommier) in the name of M. de la Pommeraye, whose lectures we used to attend, do you remember, Saniette, in the days when the worthy Porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth, as Proconsul in Odeonia?\u201d \u201cYou said that Cholet was derived from chou,\u201d I remarked to Brichot. \u201cAm I to suppose that the name of a station I passed before reaching Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Frichoux, comes from chou also?\u201d \u201cNo, Saint-Frichoux is Sanctus Fruc-tuosus, asSanctus Ferreolus gave rise to Saint-Fargeau, but that is not Norman in the least.\u201d \u201cHe knows too much, he\u2019s boring us,\u201d the Princess muttered softly. \u201cThere are so many other names that interest me, but I can\u2019t ask you everything at once.\u201d And, turning to Cottard, \u201cIs Madame Putbus here?\u201d I asked him. On hearing Brichot utter the name of Saniette, M. Verdurin cast at his wife and at Cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest. \u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, who had overheard my question, \u201cI have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of Venice, we are rid of her for this year.\u201d \u201cI shall myself be entitled presently to two trees,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cfor I have more or less taken a little house between Saint-Martin-du-Chene and Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs.\u201d \u201cBut that is quite close to here, I hope that you will come over often with Charlie Morel. You have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains, you are only a step from Donci\u00e8res,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who hated people\u2019s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them. She knew how stiff the climb was to la Raspeli\u00e8re, even if you took the zigzag path, behind F\u00e9terne, which was half-an-hour longer; she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them, or even, having in reality stayed away, might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at Douville-F\u00e9terne, and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot. To this invitation M. de Charlus responded with a silent bow. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week, he seems a tough customer,\u201d the doctor whispered to Ski, for having remained quite simple, notwithstanding a surface-dressing of pride, he made no attempt to conceal the fact that Charlus had snubbed him. \u201cHe is doubtless unaware that at all the watering-places, and even in Paris in the wards, the physicians, who naturally regard me as their \u2018chief,\u2019 make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present, not that they need to be asked twice. It makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable,\u201d he added carelessly. \u201cIndeed at Donci\u00e8res the medical officer of the regiment, who is the doctor who attends the Colonel, invited me to luncheon to meet him, saying that I was fully entitled to dine with the General. And that General is a Monsieur de something. I don\u2019t know whether his title-deeds are more or less ancient than those of this Baron.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him, his is a very humble coronet,\u201d replied Ski in an undertone, and added some vague statement including a word of which I caught only the last syllable, -ast, being engaged in listening to what Brichot was saying to M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, as for that, I am sorry to say, you have probably one tree only, for if Saint-Martin-du-Ch\u00eane is obviouslySanctus Martinus juxta quercum, on the other hand, the word if may be simply the root ave, eve, which means moist, as in Aveyron, Lod\u00e8ve, Yvette, and which you see survive in our kitchen-sinks (\u00e9viers). It is the word eau which in Breton is represented by ster, Ster-maria, Sterlaer, Sterbouest, Ster-en-Dreuchen.\u201d I heard no more, for whatever the pleasure I might feel on hearing again the name Stermaria, I could not help listening to Cottard, next to whom I was seated, as he murmured to Ski: \u201cIndeed! I was not aware of it. So he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind! He is one of the happy band, is he? He hasn\u2019t got rings of fat round his eyes, all the same. I shall have to keep my feet well under me, or he may start squeezing them. But I\u2019m not at all surprised. I am used to seeing noblemen in the bath, in their birthday suits, they are all more or less degenerates. I don\u2019t talk to them, because after all I am in an official position and it might do me harm. But they know quite well who I am.\u201d Saniette, whom Brichot\u2019s appeal had frightened, was beginning to breathe again, like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder, when he heard M. Verdurin interrogate him, fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking, so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure. \u201cBut you never told us that you went to those matin\u00e9es at the Od\u00e9on, Saniette?\u201d Trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant, Saniette replied, making his speech as diminutive as possible, so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow: \u201cOnly once, to the Chercheuse.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that he says?\u201d shouted M. Verdurin, with an air of disgust and fury combined, knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible. \u201cIt is impossible to understand what you say, what have you got in your mouth?\u201d inquired M. Verdurin, growing more and more furious, and alluding to Saniette\u2019s defective speech. \u201cPoor Saniette, I won\u2019t have him made unhappy,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin in a tone of false pity, so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband\u2019s insolent intention. \u201cI was at the Ch . . . Che..\u201d \u201cChe, che, try to speak distinctly,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word you say.\u201d Almost without exception, the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man\u2019s skin has aroused the thirst for blood. For the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike. And we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of, which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired. It is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings. \u201cCome, now, it is not his fault,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIt is not mine either, people ought not to dine out if they can\u2019t speak properly.\u201d \u201cI was at the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit by Favart.\u201d \u201cWhat! It\u2019s theChercheuse d\u2019Esprit that you call the Chercheuse? Why, that\u2019s marvellous! I might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it,\u201d cried M. Verdurin, who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary, were not artistic, were not \u2018one of us,\u2019 if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works. For instance, one was expected to say the Malade, the Bourgeois; and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand \u2018shop,\u2019 just as in a drawing-room a person proves that he is not in society by saying \u2018M. de Montesquiou-F\u00e9zensac\u2019 instead of \u2018M. de Montesquieu.\u2019 \u201cBut it is not so extraordinary,\u201d said Saniette, breathless with emotion but smiling, albeit he was in no smiling mood. Mme. Verdurin could not contain herself. \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d she cried with a titter. \u201cYou may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d M. Verdurin went on in a gentler tone, addressing both Saniette and Brichot: \u201cIt is quite a pretty piece, all the same, the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d Uttered in a serious tone, this simple phrase, in which one could detect no trace of malice, did Saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment. He was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence. Brichot was more loquacious. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he replied to M. Verdurin, \u201cand if it could be passed off as the work of some Sarmatian or Scandinavian author, we might put forward the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece. But, be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle Favart, he had not the Ibsenian temperament.\u201d (Immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair, remembering the Norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that Brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name Bussi\u00e8re.) \u201cHowever, now that Porel\u2019s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a Tolstoist of rigorous observance, it may come to pass that we shall witnessAnna Karenina or Resurrection beneath the Od\u00e9onian architrave.\u201d \u201cI know the portrait of Favart to which you allude,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI have seen a very fine print of it at Comtesse Mol\u00e9\u2018s.\u201d The name of Comtesse Mol\u00e9 made a great impression upon Mme. Verdurin. \u201cOh! So you go to Mme. de Mol\u00e9\u2018s!\u201d she exclaimed. She supposed that people said Comtesse Mol\u00e9, Madame Mol\u00e9, simply as an abbreviation, as she heard people say \u2018the Rohans\u2019 or in contempt, as she herself said: \u2018Madame la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2019 She had no doubt that Comtesse Mol\u00e9, who knew the Queen of Greece and the Principessa di Caprarola, had as much right as anybody to the particle, and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage, and one who had been extremely civil to herself. And so, to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the Comtesse her \u2018de,\u2019 she went on: \u201cBut I had no idea that you knew Madame de Mol\u00e9!\u201d as though it had been doubly extraordinary, both that M. de Charlus should know the lady, and that Mme. Verdurin should not know that he knew her. Now society, or at least the people to whom M. de Charlus gave that name, forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole. And so it is comprehensible that, in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes, a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends: \u201cBut how in the world do you come to know him?\u201d whereas to be surprised at a Frenchman\u2019s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together M. de Charlus and the Comtesse Mol\u00e9. What is more, even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society, how could there be anything strange in the fact of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing of it, since she was meeting M. de Charlus for the first time, and his relations with Mme. Mol\u00e9 were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him, about whom, to tell the truth, she knew nothing. \u201cWho was it that played this Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit, my good Saniette?\u201d asked M. Verdurin. Albeit he felt that the storm had passed, the old antiquarian hesitated before answering. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou frighten him, you make fun of everything that he says, and then you expect him to answer. Come along, tell us who played the part, and you shall have some galantine to take home,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, making a cruel allusion to the penury into which Saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend. \u201cI can remember only that it was Mme. Samary who played the Zerbine,\u201d said Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine? What in the world is that,\u201d M. Verdurin shouted, as though the house were on fire. \u201cIt is one of the parts in the old repertory, like Captain Fracasse, as who should say the Fire-eater, the Pedant.\u201d \u201cAh, the pedant, that\u2019s yourself. The Zerbine! No, really the man\u2019s mad,\u201d exclaimed M. Verdurin. Mme. Verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine, he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means. You are like M. de Longepierre, the stupidest man I know, who said to us quite calmly the other day \u2018the Banat.\u2019 Nobody had any idea what he meant. Finally we were informed that it was a province in Serbia.\u201d To put an end to Saniette\u2019s torture, which hurt me \u2018more than it hurt him, I asked Brichot if he knew what the word Balbec meant. \u201cBalbec is probably a corruption of Dalbec,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne would have to consult the charters of the Kings of England, Overlords of Normandy, for Balbec was held of the Barony of Dover, for which reason it was often styled Balbec d\u2019Outre-Mer, Balbec-en-Terre. But the Barony of Dover was itself held of the Bishopric of Bayeux, and, notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the Templars, from the time of Louis d\u2019Harcourt, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Bishop of Bayeux; it was the Bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of Balbec. So it was explained to me by the incumbent of Douville, a bald person, eloquent, fantastic, and a devotee of the table, who lives by the Rule of Brillat-Savarin, and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy, while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes.\u201d While Brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things, Saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen. The witty remark was what was known as a \u2018comparison,\u2019 but had changed its form, for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles, an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another, and so forth. . . . At one time the typical \u2018comparison\u2019 was the \u2018height of. . . . \u2019 But this was out of date, no one used it any more, there was only Cottard left to say still, on occasion, in the middle of a game of piquet: \u201cDo you know what is the height of absent-mindedness, it is to think that the Edict (l\u2019edit) of Nantes was an Englishwoman.\u201d These \u2018heights\u2019 had been replaced by nicknames. In reality it was still the old \u2018comparison,\u2019 but, as the nickname was in fashion, people did not observe the survival. Unfortunately for Saniette, when these \u2018comparisons\u2019 were not his own, and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus, he produced them so timidly that, notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature, nobody saw the point. And if on the other hand the joke was his own, as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful, and the latter had repeated it, appropriating the authorship, the joke was in that case known, but not as being Saniette\u2019s. And so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised, but, because he was its author, he was accused of plagiarism. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d Brichot continued, \u201cBee, in Norman, is a stream; there is the Abbey of Bee, Mobec, the stream from the marsh (Mor or Mer meant a marsh, as in Morville, or in Bricquemar, Alvimare, Cambremer), Bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from Briga, a fortified place, as in Bricqueville, Bricquebose, le Bric, Briand, or indeed Brice, bridge, which is the same asbruck in German (Innsbruck), and as the English  which ends so many place-names (Cambridge, for instance). You have moreover in Normandy many other instances of bec: Caudebec, Bolbec, le Robec, le Bec-Hellouin, Becquerel. It is the Norman form of the German bach Offenbach, Anspach. Varaguebec, from the old word varaigne, equivalent to warren, preserved woods or ponds. As for Dal,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit is a form of thal, a valley: Darnetal, Rosendal, and indeed, close to Louviers, Becdal. The river that has given its name to Balbec, is, by the way, charming. Seen from a falaise (fels in German, you have indeed, not far from here, standing on a height, the picturesque town of Falaise), it runs close under the spires of the church, which is actually a long way from it, and seems to be reflecting them.\u201d \u201cI should think,\u201d said I, \u201cthat is an effect that Elstir admires greatly. I have seen several sketches of it in his studio.\u201d \u201cElstir! You know Tiche,\u201d cried Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut do you know that we used to be the dearest friends? Thank heaven, I never see him now. No, but ask Cottard, Brichot, he used to have his place laid at my table, he came every day. Now, there\u2019s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus. I shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me; you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now, which I don\u2019t care for at all, not at all! Why! I made him do me a portrait of Cottard, not to mention all the sketches he has made of me.\u201d \u201cAnd he gave the Professor purple hair,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a Fellow of the College. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir, whether you find that my husband has purple hair.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, raising her chin with an air of contempt for Mme. Cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking, \u201che was a brave colourist, a fine painter. Whereas,\u201d she added, turning again to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you call it painting, all those huge she-devils of composition, those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me. For my part, I call it daubing, it\u2019s all so hackneyed, and besides, it lacks relief, personality. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHe revives the grace of the eighteenth century, but in a modern form,\u201d Saniette broke out, fortified and reassured by my affability. \u201cBut I prefer Helleu.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not in the least like Helleu,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cYes, he has the fever of the eighteenth century. He\u2019s a steam Watteau,\u201d and he began to laugh. \u201cOld, old as the hills, I\u2019ve had that served up to me for years,\u201d said M. Verdurin, to whom indeed Ski had once repeated the remark, but as his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible, it is not your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, \u201cbecause he was really gifted, he has wasted a charming temperament for painting. Ah! if he had stayed with us! Why, he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day. And it is a woman that has dragged him down so low! Not that that surprises me, for he was a pleasant enough man, but common. At bottom, he was a mediocrity. I may tell you that I felt it at once. Really, he never interested me. I was very fond of him, that was all. For one thing, he was so dirty. Tell me, do you, now, really like people who never wash?\u201d \u201cWhat is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating?\u201d asked Ski. \u201cIt is called strawberry mousse,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut it is ex-qui-site. You ought to open bottles of Ch\u00e2teau-Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, port wine.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how he amuses me, he never drinks anything but water,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay. \u201cBut not to drink,\u201d Ski went on, \u201cyou shall fill all our glasses, they will bring in marvelous peaches, huge nectarines, there against the sunset; it will be as gorgeous as a fine Veronese.\u201d \u201cIt would cost almost as much,\u201d M. Verdurin murmured. \u201cBut take away those cheeses with their hideous colour,\u201d said Ski, trying to snatch the plate from before his host, who defended his gruy\u00e8re with his might and main. \u201cYou can realise that I don\u2019t regret Elstir,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to me, \u201cthat one is far more gifted. Elstir is simply hard work, the man who can\u2019t make himself give up painting when he would like to. He is the good student, the slavish competitor. Ski, now, only follows his own fancy. You will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner.\u201d \u201cAfter all, I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t invite his wife,\u201d said Cottard, \u201che would be with us still.\u201d \u201cWill you mind what you\u2019re saying, please, I don\u2019t open my doors to street-walkers, Monsieur le Professeur,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who had, on the contrary, done everything in her power to make Elstir return, even with his wife. But before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel, had told Elstir that the woman he loved was stupid, dirty, immoral, a thief. For once in a way she had failed to effect a breach. It was with the Verdurin salon that Elstir had broken; and he was glad of it, as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation. \u201cHe really is magnificent, the Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not declare outright that I keep a disorderly house? Anyone would think you didn\u2019t know what Madame Elstir was like. I would sooner have the lowest street-walker at my table! Oh no, I don\u2019t stand for that sort of thing. Besides I may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife, when the husband no longer interests me, he is out of date, he can\u2019t even draw.\u201d \u201cThat is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceven at the time when he had talent, for he had it, the wretch, and to spare, what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence.\u201d Mme. Verdurin, in passing this judgment upon Elstir, had not waited for their quarrel, or until she had ceased to care for his painting. The fact was that, even at the time when he formed part of the little group, it would happen that Elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom, rightly or wrongly, Mme. Verdurin considered a goose, which, in her opinion, was not the conduct of an intelligent man. \u201cNo,\u201d she observed with an air of finality, \u201cI consider that his wife and he are made for one another. Heaven knows, there isn\u2019t a more boring creature on the face of the earth, and I should go mad if I had to spend a couple of hours with her. But people say that he finds her very intelligent. There\u2019s no use denying it, our Tiche was extremely stupid. I have seen him bowled over by people you can\u2019t conceive, worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan. Well! He wrote to them, he argued with them, he, Elstir! That doesn\u2019t prevent his having charming qualities, oh, charming and deliciously absurd, naturally.\u201d For Mme. Verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies. A false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth. Certainly, people\u2019s follies are insupportable. But a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted. So that the oddities of charming people exasperate us, but there are few if any charming people who are not, at the same time, odd. \u201cLook, I shall be able to shew you his flowers now,\u201d she said to me, seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise. And she took M. de Cambremer\u2019s arm again. M. Verdurin tried to apologise for this to M. de Charlus, as soon as he had got rid of Mme. de Cambremer, and to give him his reasons, chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title, momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled. But first of all he was anxious to make it clear to M. de Charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities. \u201cExcuse my mentioning so small a point,\u201d he began, \u201cfor I can understand how little such things mean to you. Middle-class minds pay attention to them, but the others, the artists, the people who are really of our sort, don\u2019t give a rap for them. Now, from the first words we exchanged, I realised that you were one of us!\u201d M. de Charlus, who gave a widely different meaning to this expression, drew himself erect. After the doctor\u2019s oglings, he found his host\u2019s insulting frankness suffocating. \u201cDon\u2019t protest, my dear Sir, you are one of us, it is plain as daylight,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. \u201cObserve that I have no idea whether you practise any of the arts, but that is not necessary. It is not always sufficient. Dechambre, who has just died, played exquisitely, with the most vigorous execution, but he was not one of us, you felt at once that he was not one of us. Brichot is not one of us. Morel is, my wife is, I can feel that you are. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201d interrupted M. de Charlus, who was beginning to feel reassured as to M. Verdurin\u2019s meaning, but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud. \u201cOnly that we put you on the left,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with a comprehending, genial, insolent smile, replied: \u201cWhy! That is not of the slightest importance,here!\u201d And he gave a little laugh that was all his own \u2014 a laugh that came to him probably from some Bavarian or Lorraine grandmother, who herself had inherited it, in identical form, from an ancestress, so that it had been sounding now, without change, for not a few centuries in little old-fashioned European courts, and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare. There are times when, to paint a complete portrait of some one, we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description, and our portrait of the figure that M. de Charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh, so delicate, so light, just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those \u2018small trumpets,\u2019 with a sound so entirely their own, for which the composer wrote this or that part. \u201cBut,\u201d M. Verdurin explained, stung by his laugh, \u201cwe did it on purpose. I attach no importance whatever to title of nobility,\u201d he went on, with that contemptuous smile which I have seen so many people whom I have known, unlike my grandmother and my mother, assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess, before others who thus, they supposed, would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you see, since we happened to have M. de Cambremer here, and he is a Marquis, while you are only a Baron. . . . \u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d M. de Charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished Verdurin, \u201cI am also Duc de Brabant, Damoiseau de Montargis, Prince d\u2019Oloron, de Carency, de Viareggio and des Dunes. However, it is not of the slightest importance. Please do not distress yourself,\u201d he concluded, resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words: \u201cI could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin came across to me to shew me Elstir\u2019s flowers. If this action, to which I had grown so indifferent, of going out to dinner, had on the contrary, taking the form that made it entirely novel, of a journey along the coast, followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea, produced in me a sort of intoxication, this feeling had not been dispelled at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cJust look at this, now,\u201d said the Mistress, shewing me some huge and splendid roses by Elstir, whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out, however, with almost too creamy a relief from the flower-stand upon which they were arranged. \u201cDo you suppose he would still have to touch to get that? Don\u2019t you call that striking? And besides, it\u2019s fine as matter, it would be amusing to handle. I can\u2019t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them. One could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect.\u201d And the Mistress\u2019s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her; behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her, she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them, in the course of a morning, in their freshness, so that, they on the table, it leaning against the back of a chair, had been able to meet face to face at the Mistress\u2019s luncheon party, the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait. Almost only, for Elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain. He had shewn in this water-colour the appearance of the roses which he had seen, and which, but for him, no one would ever have known; so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter, like a skilful gardener, had enriched the family of the Roses. \u201cFrom the day he left the little nucleus, he was finished. It seems, my dinners made him waste his time, that I hindered the development of his genius,\u201d she said in a tone of irony. \u201cAs if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist,\u201d she exclaimed with a burst of pride. Close beside us, M. de Cambremer, who was already seated, seeing that M. de Charlus was standing, made as though to rise and offer him his chair. This offer may have arisen, in the Marquis\u2019s mind, from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite. M. de Charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a Prince, and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it. And so he exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing? I beg of you! The idea!\u201d The astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically \u2018Guermantes\u2019 which became even more evident in the imperative, superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down, as though to force him to remain seated, upon the shoulders of M. de Cambremer who had not risen. \u201cCome, come, my dear fellow,\u201d the Baron insisted, \u201cthis is too much. There is no reason for it! In these days we keep that for Princes of the Blood.\u201d I made no more effect on the Cambremers than on Mme. Verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house. For I remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences; at times I even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine. I enraged Mme. de Cambremer by telling her that I had supposed the place to be more in the country. On the other hand I broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door. \u201cI see you like draughts,\u201d they said to me. My praise of the patch of green lining-cloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success: \u201cHow frightful!\u201d cried the Marquise. The climax came when I said: \u201cMy greatest joy was when I arrived. When I heard my step echoing along the gallery, I felt that I had come into some village council-office, with a map of the district on the wall.\u201d This time, Mme. de Cambremer resolutely turned her back on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the arrangement too bad?\u201d her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony. \u201cThey have some fine things.\u201d But, inasmuch as malice, when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits, finds fault with everything, in the persons or in the houses, of the people who have supplanted the critic: \u201cYes, but they are not in the right places. Besides, are they really as fine as all that?\u201d \u201cYou noticed,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness, \u201cthere are some Jouy hangings that are worn away, some quite threadbare things in this drawing-room!\u201d \u201cAnd that piece of stuff with its huge roses, like a peasant woman\u2019s quilt,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy, impressionist painting and Debussy\u2019s music. And, so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste: \u201cAnd they have put up windscreens! Such bad style! What can you expect of such people, they don\u2019t know, where could they have learned? They must be retired tradespeople. It\u2019s really not bad for them.\u201d \u201cI thought the chandeliers good,\u201d said the Marquis, though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers, just as inevitably, whenever anyone spoke of a church, whether it was the Cathedral of Chartres, or of Rheims, or of Amiens, or the church at Balbec, what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be: \u201cthe organ-loft, the pulpit and the misericords.\u201d \u201cAs for the garden, don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cIt\u2019s a massacre. Those paths running all crooked.\u201d I seized the opportunity while Mme. Verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which M. de Cambremer had brought me, and in which his mother invited me to dinner. With that faint trace of ink, the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future I should be able to recognise among a thousand, without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens, than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision. Indeed a paralytic, stricken with agraphia after a seizure, and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it, would have gathered that Mme. de Cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions. He would have guessed also the period in which the Marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play Chopin\u2019s music. It was the time when well-bred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives. Mme. de Cambremer combined the two rules in one. A laudatory adjective was not enough for her, she followed it (after a little stroke of the pen) with a second, then (after another stroke), with a third. But, what was peculiar to herself was that, in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed, the sequence of the three epithets assumed in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo. Mme. de Cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen Saint-Loup and had appreciated more than ever his \u2018unique \u2014 rare \u2014 real\u2019 qualities, that he was coming to them again with one of his friends (the one who was in love with her daughter-in-law), and that if I cared to come, with or without them, to dine at F\u00e9terne she would be \u2018delighted \u2014 happy \u2014 pleased.\u2019 Perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady, while determined to utter three exclamations, was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first. Add but a fourth adjective, and, of her initial friendliness, there would be nothing left. Moreover, with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance, Mme. de Cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word (which might in time begin to ring false) \u2018sincere,\u2019 the word \u2018true.\u2019 And to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled, she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective \u2018true\u2019 before its noun, and planted it boldly after. Her letters ended with: \u201cCroyez \u00e0 mon amiti\u00e9 vraie.\u201d \u201cCroyez \u00e0 ma sympathie vraie.\u201d Unfortunately, this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the time-honoured formulas, of the meaning of which people have ceased to think. I was, however, hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of M. de Charlus, who, still on the same topic, was saying to M. de Cambremer: \u201cYou reminded me, when you offered me your chair, of a gentleman from whom I received a letter this morning, addressed: \u2018To His Highness, the Baron de Charlus,\u2019 and beginning \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be sure, your correspondent was slightly exaggerating,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer, giving way to a discreet show of mirth. M. de Charlus had provoked this; he did not partake in it. \u201cWell, if it comes to that, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI may observe that, heraldically speaking, he was entirely in the right. I am not regarding it as a personal matter, you understand. I should say the same of anyone else. But one has to face the facts, history is history, we can\u2019t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it. I need not cite the case of the Emperor William, who at Kiel never ceased to address me as \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 I have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the Dukes of France, which was an abuse of the privilege, but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at France herself.\u201d \u201cMore delicate, perhaps, than sincere,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cAh! There I must differ from you. Observe that, personally, a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that Hohenzollern, a Protestant to boot, and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the King of Hanover, can be no favourite of mine,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with whom the annexation of Hanover seemed to rankle more than that of Alsace-Lorraine. \u201cBut I believe the feeling that turns the Emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere. Fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor. He is on the contrary marvellously intelligent; it is true that he knows nothing about painting, and has forced Herr Tschudi to withdraw the Elstirs from the public galleries. But Louis XIV did not appreciate the Dutch Masters, he had the same fondness for display, and yet he was, when all is said, a great Monarch. Besides, William II has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that Louis XIV failed to do, and I hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the Roi Soleil. The Republic made a great mistake, to my mind, in rejecting the overtures of the Hohenzollern, or responding to them only in driblets. He is very well aware of it himself and says, with that gift that he has for the right expression: \u2018What I want is a clasped hand, not a raised hat.\u2019 As a man, he is vile; he has abandoned, surrendered, denied his best friends, in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the Eulenburg affair, and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him: \u201cThe Emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial. But he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion. We would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed.\u201d \u201cAll that, however, has nothing to do with what I was trying to explain, which is that, in Germany, mediatised Princes like ourselves are Durchlaucht, and in France our rank of Highness was publicly recognised. Saint-Simon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part, in which he is entirely mistaken. The reason that he gives, namely that Louis XIV forbade us to style him the Most Christian King and ordered us to call him simply the King, proves merely that we held our title from him, and not that we had not the rank of Prince. Otherwise, it would have to be withheld from the Duc de Lorraine and ever so many others. Besides, several of our titles come from the House of Lorraine through Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Espinay, my great-grandmother, who was the daughter of the Damoiseau de Commercy.\u201d Observing that Morel was listening, M. de Charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim. \u201cI have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of Gotha, but in the second, not to say the first, that the account of our family ought to be included,\u201d he said, without stopping to think that Morel did not know what \u2018Gotha\u2019 was. \u201cBut that is his affair, he is the Head of my House, and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass, I have only to shut my eyes.\u201d \u201cM. Brichot interests me greatly,\u201d I said to Mme. Verdurin as she joined me, and I slipped Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s letter into my pocket. \u201cHe has a cultured mind and is an excellent man,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cOf course what he lacks is originality and taste, he has a terrible memory. They used to say of the \u2018forebears\u2019 of the people we have here this evening, the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, that they had forgotten nothing. But they had at least the excuse,\u201d she said, borrowing one of Swann\u2019s epigrams, \u201cthat they had learned nothing. Whereas Brichot knows everything, and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner. I\u2019m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages.\u201d While Mme. Verdurin was speaking, it occurred to me that I had determined to ask her something, but I could not remember what it was. I could not at this moment say what Mme. Verdurin was wearing that evening. Perhaps even then I was no more able to say, for I have not an observant mind. But feeling that her dress was not unambitious I said to her something polite and even admiring. She was like almost all women, who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth, and is a judgment impartially, irresistibly pronounced, as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person. And so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question, habitual in the circumstances: \u201cYou like it?\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re talking about Brichot. Eh, Chantepie, Freycinet, he spared you nothing. I had my eye on you, my little Mistress!\u201d \u201cI saw you, it was all I could do not to laugh.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about Chantepie, I am certain,\u201d said M. Verdurin, as he came towards us. I had been alone, as I thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood, in failing to notice that, while he discussed etymologies, Brichot had been provoking derision. And inasmuch as the expressions which, for me, gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them, as unimportant, they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of Mme. Verdurin who saw that I had \u2018swallowed\u2019 Brichot, as before I had appeared stupid to Mme. de Guermantes, because I enjoyed going to see Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. With Brichot, however, there was another reason. I was not one of the little clan. And in every clan, whether it be social, political, literary, one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation, in an official speech, in a story, in a sonnet, everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there. How many times have I found myself, after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly old-fashioned Academician, on the point of saying to Bloch or to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cHow charming this is!\u201d when before I had opened my mouth they exclaimed, each in a different language: \u201cIf you want to be really amused, read a tale by So-and-so. Human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths.\u201d Bloch\u2019s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style, pleasant enough in themselves, were slightly faded; that of Mme. de Guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant, for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me. I was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the Verdurins\u2019 apparent friendliness for Brichot than to hear, some days later, at F\u00e9terne, the Cambremers say to me, on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la Raspeli\u00e8re: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you can be sincere, after all they\u2019ve done to it.\u201d It is true that they admitted that the china was good. Like the shocking windscreens, it had escaped my notice. \u201cAnyhow, when you go back to Balbec, you will know what Balbec means,\u201d said M. Verdurin ironically. It was precisely the things Brichot had told me that interested me. As for what they called his mind, it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan. He talked with the same irritating fluency, but his words no longer carried, having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes; what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience. \u201cTake care,\u201d Mme. Verdurin murmured, pointing to Brichot. The latter, whose hearing remained keener than his vision, darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a short-sighted philosopher. If his bodily eyes were less good, his mind\u2019s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things. He saw how little was to be expected of human affection, and resigned himself to it. Undoubtedly the discovery pained him. It may happen that even the man who on one evening only, in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy, realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud, or too forward, or whatever it may be, returns home miserable. Often it is a difference of opinion, or of system, that has made him appear to other people absurd or old-fashioned. Often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself. He could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned, he is tempted to pay a call, to write a letter: on second thoughts, he does nothing, awaits the invitation for the following week. Sometimes, too, these discomfitures, instead of ending with the evening, last for months. Arising from the instability of social judgments, they increase that instability further. For the man who knows that Mme. X despises him, feeling that he is respected at Mme. Y\u2019s, pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house. This however is not the proper place to describe those men, superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it, glad to be invited, embittered by being disparaged, discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated, ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new, and when they have begun to forget those of the old. We may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that Brichot felt at one which he knew to be final. He was not unaware that Mme. Verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly, even at his infirmities, and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection, submitting himself to the facts, he continued nevertheless to regard the Mistress as his best friend. But, from the blush that swept over the scholar\u2019s face, Mme. Verdurin saw that he had heard her, and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening. I could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to Saniette. \u201cWhat! Not kind to him! Why, he adores us, you can\u2019t imagine what we are to him. My husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity, and you must admit that he has every reason, but when that happens why doesn\u2019t he rise in revolt, instead of cringing like a whipped dog? It is not honest. I don\u2019t like it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t always try to calm my husband, because if he went too far, all that would happen would be that Saniette would stay away; and I don\u2019t want that because I may tell you that he hasn\u2019t a penny in the world, he needs his dinners. But after all, if he does mind, he can stay away, it has nothing to do with me, when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot.\u201d \u201cThe Duchy of Aumale was in our family for years before passing to the House of France,\u201d M. de Charlus was explaining to M. de Cambremer, before a speechless Morel, for whom, as a matter of fact, the whole of this dissertation was, if not actually addressed to him, intended. \u201cWe took precedence over all foreign Princes; I could give you a hundred examples. The Princesse de Croy having attempted, at the burial of Monsieur, to fall on her knees after my great-great-grandmother, that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock, made the officer on duty remove it, and reported the matter to the King, who ordered Mme. de Croy to call upon Mme. de Guermantes and offer her apologies. The Duc de Bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands, we obtained the King\u2019s authority to have them lowered. I know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one\u2019s own family. But it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger. Our battle-cry, after we abandoned that of the Dukes of Brabant, was Passavant! So that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first, which we had established for so many centuries in war, should afterwards have been confirmed to us at Court. And, egad, it has always been admitted there. I may give you a further instance, that of the Princess of Baden. As she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same Duchesse de Guermantes of whom I was speaking just now, and had attempted to go in first to the King\u2019s presence, taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn (although there could be no reason for it), the King called out: \u2018Come in, cousin, come in; Mme. de Baden knows very well what her duty is to you.\u2019 And it was as Duchesse de Guermantes that she held this rank, albeit she was of no mean family herself, since she was through her mother niece to the Queen of Poland, the Queen of Hungary, the Elector Palatine, the Prince of Savoy-Carignano and the Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England.\u201d \u201cMaecenas atavis \u00e9dite regibus!\u201d said Brichot, addressing M. de Charlus, who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked Brichot, anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech. \u201cI was referring, Heaven forgive me, to a dandy who was the pick of the basket\u201d (Mme. Verdurin winced) \u201cabout the time of Augustus\u201d (Mme. Verdurin, reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket, assumed a more serene expression), \u201cof a friend of Virgil and Horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic, his royal descent, in a word I was referring to Maecenas, a bookworm who was the friend of Horace, Virgil, Augustus. I am sure that M. de Charlus knows all about Maecenas.\u201d With a gracious, sidelong glance at Mme. Verdurin, because he had heard her make an appointment with Morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also, \u201cI should say,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cthat Maecenas was more or less the Verdurin of antiquity.\u201d Mme. Verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction. She went over to Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, your father\u2019s friend,\u201d she said to him. \u201cOne can see that he\u2019s an educated man, and well bred. He will get on well in our little nucleus. What is his address in Paris?\u201d Morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards. Mme. Verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first. To the general astonishment, M. de Charlus, who never referred to his own considerable gifts, accompanied, in the purest style, the closing passage (uneasy, tormented, Schumannesque, but, for all that, earlier than Franck\u2019s Sonata) of the Sonata for piano and violin by Faur\u00e9. I felt that he would furnish Morel, marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity, with just those qualities that he lacked, culture and style. But I thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift. M. de Charlus was not very different from his brother, the Duc de Guermantes. Indeed, a moment ago (though this was rare), he had spoken as bad French as his brother. He having reproached me (doubtless in order that I might speak in glowing terms of Morel to Mme. Verdurin) with never coming to see him, and I having pleaded discretion, he had replied: \u201cBut, since it is I that asks you, there is no one but I who am in a position to take offence.\u201d This might have been said by the Duc de Guermantes. M. de Charlus was only a Guermantes when all was said. But it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the Duke would have chosen one of Virgil\u2019s shepherds or Plato\u2019s disciples, and at once qualities unknown to the Duc de Guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made M. de Charlus an exquisite pianist, an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste, an eloquent talker. Who would ever have detected that the rapid, eager, charming style with which M. de Charlus played the Schumannesque passage of Faur\u00e9\u2018s Sonata had its equivalent \u2014 one dares not say its cause \u2014 in elements entirely physical, in the nervous defects of M. de Charlus? We shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects, and why it is that a Greek of the time of Socrates, a Roman of the time of Augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men, and not men-women such as we see around us to-day. Just as he had genuine artistic tendencies, which had never come to fruition, so M. de Charlus had, far more than the Duke, loved their mother, loved his own wife, and indeed, years after her death, if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears, but superficial tears, like the perspiration of an over-stout man, whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion. With this difference, that to the latter we say: \u201cHow hot you are,\u201d whereas we pretend not to notice other people\u2019s tears. We, that is to say, people in society; for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage. His sorrow after the death of his wife, thanks to the habit of falsehood, did not debar M. de Charlus from a life which was not in harmony \u2022with it. Indeed later on, he sank so low as to let it be known that, during the funeral rites, he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address. And it may have been true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the piece eame to an end, I ventured to ask for some Franck, which appeared to cause Mme. de Cambremer such acute pain that I did not insist. \u201cYou can\u2019t admire that sort of thing,\u201d she said to me. Instead she asked for Debussy\u2019s F\u00eates, which made her exclaim: \u201cAh! How sublime!\u201d from the first note. But Morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only, and in a spirit of mischief, without any intention to deceive, began a March by Meyerbeer. Unfortunately, as he left little interval and made no announcement, everybody supposed that he was still playing Debussy, and continued to exclaim \u2018Sublime!\u2019 Morel, by revealing that the composer was that not of Pell\u00e9as but of Robert le Diable created a certain chill. Mme. de Cambremer had scarcely time to feel it, for she had just discovered a volume of Scarlatti, and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse. \u201cOh! Play this, look, this piece, it\u2019s divine,\u201d she cried. And yet, of this composer long despised, recently ^promoted to the highest honours, what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping, while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor. But Morel had had enough music, and as he insisted upon cards, M. de Charlus, to be able to join in, proposed a game of whist. \u201cHe was telling the Master just now that he is a Prince,\u201d said Ski to Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut it\u2019s not true, they\u2019re quite a humble family of architects.\u201d \u201cI want to know what it was you were saying about Maecenas. It interests me, don\u2019t you know!\u201d Mme. Verdurin repeated to Brichot, with an affability that carried him off his feet. And so, in order to shine in the Mistress\u2019s eyes, and possibly in mine: \u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Madame, Maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that Chinese god who numbers more followers in France to-day than Brahma, than Christ himself, the all-powerful God Ubedamd.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was no longer content, upon these occasions, with burying her head in her hands. She would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon Princess Sherbatoff; were the latter within reach the Mistress would cling to her shoulder, dig her nails into it, and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek. Concealed by this protecting screen, she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands. Mme. Verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to Beethoven quartets, so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep. \u201cI am quite serious, Madame,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cToo numerous, I consider, to-day is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe. As a matter of doctrine, I have no objection to offer to some Nirvana which will dissolve us in the great Whole (which, like Munich and Oxford, is considerably nearer to Paris than Asni\u00e8res or Bois-Colombes), but it is unworthy either of a true Frenchman, or of a true European even, when the Japanese are possibly at the gates of our Byzantium, that socialised anti-militarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse.\u201d Mme. Verdurin felt that she might dispense with the Princess\u2019s mangled shoulder, and allowed her face to become once more visible, not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath. But Brichot was determined that I should have my share in the entertainment, and having learned, from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably, that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them, to make them feel themselves important, to make them regard you as a reactionary: \u201cI have no wish to blaspheme against the Gods of Youth,\u201d he said, with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name. \u201cI have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the Mallarm\u00e9an chapel in which our new friend, like all the young men of his age, must have served the esoteric mass, at least as an acolyte, and have shewn himself deliquescent or Rosicrucian. But, really, we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big A, who, when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon Zola, inject themselves with Verlaine. Become etheromaniacs out of Baude-lairean devotion, they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may, one day or another, demand of them, anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated, enervating atmosphere, heavy with unwholesome vapours, of a symbolism of the opium-pipe.\u201d Feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for Brichot\u2019s inept and motley tirade, I turned to Ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged; he replied that he was certain of his facts, and added that I myself had said that his real name was Gandin, Le Gandin. \u201cI told you,\u201d was my answer, \u201cthat Mme. de Cambremer was the sister of an engineer, M. Legrandin. I never said a word to you about M. de Charlus. There is about as much connexion between him and Mme. de Cambremer as between the Great Cond\u00e9 and Racine.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I thought there was,\u201d said Ski lightly, with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train. \u201cDo you intend to remain long on this coast?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked M. de Charlus, in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to Paris. \u201cGood Lord, one never knows,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a nasal drawl. \u201cI should like to stay here until the end of September.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin; \u201cthat is the time for fine storms at sea.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, that is not what would influence me. I have for some time past unduly neglected the Archangel Saint Michael, my patron, and I should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast, on the 29th of September, at the Abbey on the Mount.\u201d \u201cYou take an interest in all that sort of thing?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anti-clericalism, had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the Baron \u2018fail\u2019 her for forty-eight hours. \u201cYou are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness,\u201d M. de Charlus replied insolently. \u201cI have told you that Saint Michael is one of my glorious patrons.\u201d Then, smiling with a benevolent ecstasy, his eyes gazing into the distance, his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious: \u201cIt is so beautiful at the offertory when Michael stands erect by the altar, in a white robe, swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to God.\u201d \u201cWe might go there in a party,\u201d suggested Mme. Verdurin, notwithstanding her horror of the clergy. \u201cAt that moment, when the offertory begins,\u201d went on M. de Charlus who, for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in Parliament, never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it, \u201cit would be wonderful to see our young friend Palestrinising, indeed performing an aria by Bach. The worthy Abbot, too, would be wild with joy, and that is the greatest homage, at least the greatest public homage that I can pay to my Holy Patron. What an edification for the faithful! We must mention it presently to the young Angelico of music, a warrior like Saint Michael.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette, summoned to make a fourth, declared that he did not know how to play whist. And Cottard, seeing that there was not much time left before our train, embarked at once on a game of \u00e9cart\u00e9 with Morel. M. Verdurin was furious, and bore down with a terrible expression upon Saniette. \u201cIs there anything in the world that you can play?\u201d he cried, furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist, and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar. He, in his terror, did his best to look clever. \u201cYes, I can play the piano,\u201d he said. Cottard and Morel were seated face to face. \u201cYour deal,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cSuppose we go nearer to the card-table,\u201d M. de Charlus, worried by the sight of Morel in Cottard\u2019s company, suggested to M. de Cambremer. \u201cIt is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much. The only kings that we have left, in France at least, are the kings in the pack of cards, who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso,\u201d he added a moment later, from an admiration for Morel which extended to his way of playing cards, to flatter him also, and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI-ee cut,\u201d said (imitating the accent of a cardsharper) Cottard, whose children burst out laughing, like his students and the chief dresser, whenever the master, even by the bedside of a serious case, uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d said Morel, seeking advice from M. de Charlus. \u201cJust as you please, you\u2019re bound to lose, whatever you play, it\u2019s all the same (c\u2019est \u00e9gal).\u201d \u201cEgal . . . Ingalli?\u201d said the doctor, with an insinuating, kindly glance at M. de Cambremer. \u201cShe was what we call a true diva, she was a dream, a Carmen such as we shall never see again. She was wedded to the part. I used to enjoy too listening to Ingalli \u2014 married.\u201d The Marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of well-bred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests, and adopt English manners by way of apology for a scornful expression: \u201cWho is that gentleman playing cards, what does he do for a living, what does he sell? I rather like to know whom I am meeting, so as not to make friends with any Tom, Dick or Harry. But I didn\u2019t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him.\u201d If M. Verdurin, availing himself of this phrase, had indeed introduced M. de Cambremer to his fellow-guests, the other would have been greatly annoyed. But, knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed, he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air, without risk to himself. The pride that M. Verdurin took in his intimacy with Cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor. But it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days. Then, when Cottard was scarcely known to the public, if you spoke to M. Verdurin of his wife\u2019s facial neuralgia: \u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d he would say, with the artless self-satisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous, and that everybody knows the name of their family singing-master. \u201cIf she had an ordinary doctor, one might look for a second opinion, but when that doctor is called Cottard\u201d (a name which he pronounced as though it were Bouchard or Charcot) \u201cone has simply to bow to the inevitable.\u201d Adopting a reverse procedure, knowing that M. de Cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous Professor Cottard, M. Verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s our family doctor, a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes; he is not a doctor, he is a friend, I don\u2019t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you, in any case to us it is the name of a very good man, of a very dear friend, Cottard.\u201d This name, murmured in a modest tone, took in M. de Cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else. \u201cCottard? You don\u2019t mean Professor Cottard?\u201d At that moment one heard the voice of the said Professor who, at an awkward point in the game, was saying as he looked at his cards: \u201cThis is where Greek meets Greek.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, to be sure, he is a professor,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cWhat! Professor Cottard! You are not making a mistake?-You are quite sure it\u2019s the same man? The one who lives in the Rue du Bac?\u201d \u201cYes, his address is 43, Rue du Bac. You know him?\u201d \u201cBut everybody knows Professor Cottard. He\u2019s at the top of the tree! You might as well ask me if I knew Bouffe de Saint-Biaise or Courtois-Suffit. I could see when I heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person, that is why I took the liberty of asking you.\u201d \u201cCome now, what shall I play, trumps?\u201d asked Cottard. Then abruptly, with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances, as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death, but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards, Cottard, deciding to play a trump, assumed a sombre, suicidal air, and, borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins, played his card as though it were his life, with the exclamation: \u201cThere it is, and be damned to it!\u201d It was not the right card to play, but he had a consolation. In the middle of the room, in a deep armchair, Mme. Cottard, yielding to the effect, which she always found irresistible, of a good dinner, had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her. In vain might she sit up now and again, and smile, whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her, she sank back, in spite of herself, into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady. More than the noise, what awakened her thus for an instant only, was the giance (which, in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut, and foresaw, for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise), the glance with which the Professor drew the attention of those present to his wife\u2019s slumbers. To begin with, he merely looked at her and smiled, for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner (or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on, but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason, so many and diverse were the views that he held about it), as an all-powerful and teasing husband, he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife, to rouse her only partly at first, so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Mme. Cottard was sound asleep. \u201cNow then, L\u00e9ontine you\u2019re snoring,\u201d the professor called to her. \u201cI am listening to Mme. Swann, my dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard replied faintly, and dropped back into her lethargy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect nonsense,\u201d exclaimed Cottard, \u201cshe\u2019ll be telling us presently that she wasn\u2019t asleep. She\u2019s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all.\u201d \u201cThey imagine it, perhaps,\u201d said M. de Cambremer with a laugh. But the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing, and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him. \u201cPeople do not imagine that they never sleep,\u201d he promulgated in a dogmatic tone. \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Marquis with a respectful bow, such as Cottard at one time would have made. \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d Cottard went on, \u201cthat you have never administered, as I have, as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking som-nolescence.\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d replied the Marquis, laughing with a superior air, \u201cI have never taken trional, or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach. When a man has been out shooting all night, like me, in the forest of Chantepie, I can assure you he doesn\u2019t need any trional to make him sleep.\u201d \u201cIt is only fools who say that,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cTrional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone. You mention trional, have you any idea what it is?\u201d \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep.\u201d \u201cYou are not answering my question,\u201d replied the Professor, who, thrice weekly, at the Faculty, sat on the board of examiners. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not, but what it is. Can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer with embarrassment. \u201cI prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 Port.\u201d \u201cWhich are ten times as toxic,\u201d the Professor interrupted. \u201cAs for trional,\u201d M. de Cambremer ventured, \u201cmy wife goes in for all that sort of thing, you\u2019d better talk to her about it.\u201d \u201cShe probably knows just as much about it as yourself. In any case, if your wife takes trional to make her sleep, you can see that mine has no need of it. Come along, L\u00e9ontine, wake up, you\u2019re getting ankylosed, did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner? What will you be like when you\u2019re sixty, if you fall asleep now like an old woman? You\u2019ll go and get fat, you\u2019re arresting the circulation. She doesn\u2019t even hear what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re bad for one\u2019s health, these little naps after dinner, ain\u2019t they, Doctor?\u201d said M. de Cambremer, seeking to rehabilitate himself with Cottard. \u201cAfter a heavy meal one ought to take exercise.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cWe have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced.\u201d \u201cThen it is sleep that stops digestion.\u201d \u201cThat depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion, stomachic digestion, intestinal digestion; it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine. Now then, L\u00e9ontine, quick march, it is time we were going.\u201d This was not true, for the doctor was going merely to continue his game, but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations. Whether a determination to remain awake survived in Mme. Cottard, even in the state of sleep, or because the armchair offered no support to her head, it was jerked mechanically from left to right, and up and down, in the empty air, like a lifeless object, and Mme. Cottard, with her nodding poll, appeared now to be listening to music, now to be in the last throes of death. Where her husband\u2019s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect, her sense of her own stupidity proved successful. \u201cMy bath is nice and hot,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut the feathers in the dictionary . . . \u201d she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright. \u201cOh! Good lord, what a fool I am. Whatever have I been saying, I was thinking about my hat, I\u2019m sure I said something silly, in another minute I should have been asleep, it\u2019s that wretched fire.\u201d Everybody began to laugh, for there was no fire in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume II ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, herself laughing, and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away, with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight, the last traces of sleep, \u201cI must offer my humble apologies to dear Mme. Verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth.\u201d But her smile at once grew sorrowful, for the Professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail, had shouted at her: \u201cLook at yourself in the glass, you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne, you look just like an old peasant.\u201d \u201cYou know, he is charming,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201che has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character. And then, he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole Faculty had given him up. He spent three nights by his bedside, without ever lying down. And so Cottard to me, you know,\u201d she went on, in a grave and almost menacing tone, raising her hand to the twin spheres, shrouded in white tresses, of her musical temples, and as though we had wished to assault the doctor, \u201cis sacred! He could ask me for anything in the world! As it is, I don\u2019t call him Doctor Cottard, I call him Doctor God! And even in saying that I am slandering him, for this God does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible.\u201d \u201cPlay a trump,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a delighted air. \u201cA trump, here goes,\u201d said the violinist. \u201cYou ought to have declared your king first,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cyou\u2019re not paying attention to the game, but how well you play!\u201d \u201cI have the king,\u201d said Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that business up there with the sticks?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, drawing M. de Cambremer\u2019s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece. \u201cAre they your arms?\u201d she added with an ironical disdain. \u201cNo, they are not ours,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cWe bear, barry of five, embattled counter-embattled or and gules, as many trefoils countercharged. No, those are the arms of the Arrachepels, who were not of our stock, but from whom we inherited the house, and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here. The Arrachepels (formerly Pelvilains, we are told) bore or five piles couped in base gules. When they allied themselves with the F\u00e9terne family, their blazon changed, but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or, a dexter canton ermine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one for her!\u201d muttered Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a d\u2019Arrachepel or de Rachepel, as you please, for both forms are found in the old charters,\u201d continued M. de Cambremer, blushing vividly, for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him, and he was afraid that Mme. Verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her. \u201cThe history books say that, in the eleventh century, the first Arrachepel, Mace, named Pelvilain, shewed a special aptitude, in siege warfare, in tearing up piles. Whence the name Arrachepel by which he was ennobled, and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms. These are the piles which, to render fortifications more impregnable, used to be driven, plugged, if you will pardon the expression, into the ground in front of them, and fastened together laterally. They are what you quite rightly called sticks, though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good Lafontaine. For they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable. Of course, with our modern artillery, they make one smile. But you must bear in mind that I am speaking of the eleventh century.\u201d \u201cIt is all rather out of date,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut the little campanile has a character.\u201d \u201cYou have,\u201d said Cottard, \u201cthe luck of . . . turlututu,\u201d a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using Moli\u00e8re\u2019s. \u201cDo you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind being in his shoes,\u201d said Morel, who was tired of military service. \u201cOh! What a bad patriot,\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who could not refrain from pinching the violinist\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army,\u201d Cottard pursued, determined to make his joke, \u201cit\u2019s because he has only one eye.\u201d \u201cYou are up against it, Doctor,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, to shew Cottard that he knew who he was. \u201cThis young man is astonishing,\u201d M. de Charlus interrupted innocently. \u201cHe plays like a god.\u201d This observation did not find favour with the doctor, who replied: \u201cNever too late to mend. Who laughs last, laughs longest.\u201d \u201cQueen, ace,\u201d Morel, whom fortune was favouring, announced triumphantly. The doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune, and admitted, spellbound: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cWe are so pleased to have met M. de Charlus,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cHad you never met him before? He is quite nice, he is unusual, he is of a period\u201c (she would have found it difficult to say which), replied Mme. Verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur, a judge and a hostess. Mme. de Cambremer asked me if I was coming to F\u00e9terne with Saint-Loup. I could not suppress a cry of admiration when I saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, presently, when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up, it will be a thousand times better.\u201d \u201cAre you staying any time in this neighbourhood, Madame?\u201d M. de Cambremer asked Mme. Cottard, a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement. \u201cOh, certainly, Sir, I regard this annual exodus as most important for the children. Whatever you may say, they must have fresh air. The Faculty wanted to send me to Vichy; but it is too stuffy there, and I can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger. Besides, the Professor, with all the examinations he has to hold, has always got his shoulder to the wheel, and the hot weather tires him dreadfully. I feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that. Whatever happens we shall stay another month at least.\u201d \u201cAh! In that case we shall meet again.\u201d \u201cBesides, I shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to Savoy, and won\u2019t be finally settled here for another fortnight.\u201d \u201cI like the view of the valley even more than the sea view,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on. \u201cYou are going to have a splendid night for your journey.\u201d \u201cWe ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready, if you are absolutely determined to go back to Balbec to-night,\u201d M. Verdurin said to me, \u201cfor I see no necessity for it myself. We could drive you over to-morrow morning. It is certain to be fine. The roads are excellent.\u201d I said that it was impossible. \u201cBut in any case it is not time yet,\u201d the Mistress protested. \u201cLeave them alone, they have heaps of time. A lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait. They are far happier here. And you, my young Mozart,\u201d she said to Morel, not venturing to address M. de Charlus directly, \u201cwon\u2019t you stay the night? We have some nice rooms facing the sea.\u201d \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d M. de Gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed card-player who had not heard. \u201cHe has a pass until midnight only. He must go back to bed like a good little boy, obedient, and well-behaved,\u201d he added in a complaisant, mannered, insistent voice, as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell, in passing, upon any reference to Morel, from touching him with (failing his fingers) words that seemed to explore his person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the sermon that Brichot had addressed to me, M. de Cambremer had concluded that I was a Dreyfusard. As he himself was as anti-Dreyfusard as possible, out of courtesy to a foe, he began to sing me the praises of a Jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the Chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved. \u201cAnd my cousin\u2019s opinions were the exact opposite,\u201d said M. de Cambremer; he omitted to mention what those opinions were, but I felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face, opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained. \u201cWell, you know, I call that really fine!\u201d was M. de Cambremer\u2019s conclusion. It is true that he was hardly employing the word \u2018fine\u2019 in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works, but works, anyhow, of art. M. de Cambremer often made use of this term, when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh. \u201cWhat, you have gained half-a-stone in two months. I say, that\u2019s fine!\u201d Refreshments were set out on a table. Mme. Verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred. M. de Charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the card-table from which he did not stir. Mme. Verdurin asked him: \u201cHave you tasted my orangeade?\u201d Upon which M. de Charlus, with a gracious smile, in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body, replied: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, it was strawberry-juice, I think, it was delicious.\u201d It is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them. If a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the Immaculate Conception, or in the innocence of Dreyfus, or in a plurality of worlds, and wishes to keep his opinion to himself, you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts. But on hearing M. de Charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d one could say: \u201cThere, he likes the stronger sex,\u201d with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed, a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years. Perhaps the people who conclude from a man\u2019s way of saying: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d a love of the kind called unnatural, have no need of any such scientific knowledge. But that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret. Without saying it in so many words to oneself, one feels that it is a gentle, smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms. And it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where, in exile, ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion, they know how to arrange a drawing-room, compose \u2018interiors.\u2019 M. de Charlus was not in the least perturbed that Mme. Verdurin should be standing, and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to Morel. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it criminal,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to the Baron, \u201cthat that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a card-table. When anyone can play the violin like that!\u201d \u201cHe plays cards well, he does everything well, he is so intelligent,\u201d said M. de Charlus, keeping his eye on the game, so as to be able to advise Morel. This was not his only reason, however, for not rising from his chair for Mme. Verdurin. With the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art, instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be, he would create a sort of tableau-vivant for himself after Saint-Simon; and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Uxelles, who interested him from other aspects also, and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated, with a pretence of laziness, before all the most distinguished persons at court. \u201cBy the way, Charlus,\u201d said Mme. Verdurip, who was beginning to grow familiar, \u201cyou don\u2019t know of any ruined old nobleman in your Faubourg who would come to me as porter?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes . . . why, yes,\u201d replied M. de Charlus with a genial smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t advise it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI should be afraid for your sake, that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther.\u201d This was the first skirmish between them. Mme. Verdurin barely noticed it. There were to be others, alas, in Paris. M. de Charlus remained glued to his chair. He could not, moreover, restrain a faint smile, seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middle-class cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of Mme. Verdurin. The Mistress appeared not at all surprised by the Baron\u2019s posture, and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by M. de Cambremer. But first of all, she wished to clear up the mystery of M. de Charlus\u2019s relations with Comtesse Mole. \u201cYou told me that you knew Mme. de Mol\u00ea. Does that mean, you go there?\u201d she asked, giving to the words \u2018go there\u2019 the sense of being received there, of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her. M. de Charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain, an affectation of precision and in a sing-song tone: \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d This \u2018sometimes\u2019 inspired doubts in Mme. Verdurin, who asked: \u201cHave you ever met the Duc de Guermantes there?\u201d \u201cAh! That I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the Duc de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cAnd how should I not know him?\u201d replied M. de Charlus, his lips curving in a smile. This smile was ironical; but as the Baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen, he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips, so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a good-natured smile. \u201cWhy do you say: \u2018How should I not know him?\u2019 \u201c \u201cBecause he is my brother,\u201d said M. de Charlus carelessly, leaving Mme. Verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her, was a natural son, or a son by another marriage. The idea that the brother of the Duc de Guermantes might be called Baron de Charlus never entered her head. She bore down upon me. \u201cI heard M. de Cambremer invite you to dinner just now. It has nothing to do with me, you understand. But for your own sake, I do hope you won\u2019t go. For one thing, the place is infested with bores. Oh! If you like dining with provincial Counts and Marquises whom nobody knows, you will be supplied to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d \u201cI think I shall be obliged to go there once or twice. I am not altogether free, however, for I have a young cousin whom I cannot leave by herself\u201d (I felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take Albertine about). \u201cBut as for the Cambremers, as I have been introduced to them. . . . \u201d \u201cYou shall do just as you please. One thing I can tell you: it\u2019s extremely unhealthy; when you have caught pneumonia, or a nice little chronic rheumatism, you\u2019ll be a lot better off!\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t the place itself very pretty?\u201d \u201cMmmmyess. . . . If you like. For my part, I confess frankly that I would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley. To begin with, if they\u2019d paid us I wouldn\u2019t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to M. Verdurin. If your cousin suffers at all from nerves. . . . But you yourself have bad nerves, I think you have choking fits. Very well! You shall see. Go there once, you won\u2019t sleep for a week after it; but it\u2019s not my business.\u201d And without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying: \u201cIf it would amuse you to see the house, which is not bad, pretty is too strong a word, still it is amusing with its old moat, and the old drawbridge, as I shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once, very well, come that day, I shall try to bring all my little circle, then it will be quite nice. The day after to-morrow we are going to Harambouville in the carriage. It\u2019s a magnificent drive, the cider is delicious. Come with us. You, Brichot, you shall come too. And you too, Ski. That will make a party which, as a matter of fact, my husband must have arranged already. I don\u2019t know whom all he has invited, Monsieur de Charlus, are you one of them?\u201d The Baron, who had not heard the whole speech, and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to Harambouville, gave a start. \u201cA strange question,\u201d he murmured in a mocking tone by which Mme. Verdurin felt hurt. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbefore you dine with the Cambremers, why not bring her here, your cousin? Does she like conversation, and clever people? Is she pleasant? Yes, very well then. Bring her with you. The Cambremers aren\u2019t the only people in the world. I can understand their being glad to invite her, they must find it difficult to get anyone. Here she will have plenty of fresh air, and lots of clever men. In any case, I am counting on you not to fail me next Wednesday. I heard you were having a tea-party at Rivebelle with your cousin, and M. de Charlus, and I forget who\u2019 else. You must arrange to bring the whole lot on here, it would be nice if you all came in a body. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to get here, the roads are charming; if you like I can send down for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you find attractive in Rivebelle, it\u2019s infested with mosquitoes. You are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rock-cakes. My cook makes them far better. I can let you have them, here, Norman rock-cakes, the real article, and shortbread; I need say no more. Ah! If you like the filth they give you at Rivebelle, that I won\u2019t give you, I don\u2019t poison my guests, Sir, and even if I wished to, my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service. Those rock-cakes you get down there, you can\u2019t tell what they are made of. I knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them, which carried her off in three days. She was only seventeen. It was sad for her poor mother,\u201d added Mme. Verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering. \u201cHowever, go and have tea at Rivebelle, if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window. But one thing I beg of you, it is a confidential mission I am charging you with, on the stroke of six, bring all your party here, don\u2019t allow them to go straggling away by themselves. You can bring whom you please. I wouldn\u2019t say that to everybody. But I am sure that your friends are nice, I can see at once that we understand one another. Apart from the little nucleus, there are some very pleasant people coming on Wednesday. You don\u2019t know little Madame de Longpont. She is charming, and so witty, not in the least a snob, you will find, you\u2019ll like her immensely. And she\u2019s going to bring a whole troop of friends too,\u201d Mme. Verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other\u2019s example. \u201cWe shall see which has most influence and brings most people, Barbe de Longpont or you. And then I believe somebody\u2019s going to bring Bergotte,\u201d she added with a vague air, this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning, to the effect that the great writer\u2019s health was causing grave anxiety. \u201cAnyhow, you will see that it will be one of my most successful Wednesdays, I don\u2019t want to have any boring women. You mustn\u2019t judge by this evening, it has been a complete failure. Don\u2019t try to be polite, you can\u2019t have been more bored than I was, I thought myself it was deadly. It won\u2019t always be like to-night, you know! I\u2019m not thinking of the Cambremers, who are impossible, but I have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant, well, compared with my little nucleus, they didn\u2019t exist. I heard you say that you thought Swann clever. I must say, to my mind, his cleverness was greatly exaggerated, but without speaking of the character of the man, which I have always found fundamentally antipathetic, sly, underhand, I have often had him to dinner on Wednesdays. Well, you can ask the others, even compared with Brichot, who is far from being anything wonderful, a good assistant master, whom I got into the Institute, Swann was simply nowhere. He was so dull!\u201d And, as I expressed a contrary opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to say a word against him to you, since he was your friend, indeed he was very fond of you, he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way, but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting, at our dinners. That, after all, is the supreme test. Well, I don\u2019t know why it was, but Swann, in my house, never seemed to come off, one got nothing out of him. And yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here.\u201d I assured her that he was highly intelligent. \u201cNo, you only think that, because you haven\u2019t known him as long as I have. One got to the end of him very soon. I was always bored to death by him.\u201d (Which may be interpreted: \u201cHe went to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and the Guermantes and knew that I didn\u2019t.\u201d) \u201cAnd I can put up with anything, except being bored. That, I cannot and will not stand!\u201d Her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which Mme. Verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group. She did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom, just as she was unable to go for a cruise, because of sea-sickness. I thought to myself that what Mme. Verdurin said was not entirely false, and, whereas the Guermantes would have declared Brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met, I remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior, if not to Swann himself, at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the Guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries; I asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that I should make, and with the earnestness of a Christian influenced by Port-Royal when he considers the problem of Grace. \u201cYou will see,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cwhen one has society people together with people of real intelligence, people of our set, that\u2019s where one has to see them, the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind, is only one-eyed here. Besides, the others don\u2019t feel at home any longer. So much so that I\u2019m inclined to ask myself whether, instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything, I shan\u2019t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus. However: you are coming again with your cousin. That\u2019s settled. Good. At any rate you will both find something to eat here. F\u00e9terne is starvation corner. Oh, by the way, if you like rats, go there at once, you will get as many as you want. And they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay. Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger. I\u2019m sure, when I go there, I shall have my dinner before I start. The more the merrier, you must come here first and escort me. We shall have high tea, and supper when we get back. Do you like apple-tarts? Yes, very well then, our chef makes the best in the world. You see, I was quite right when I told you that you were meant to live here. So come and stay. You know, there is far more room in the house than people think. I don\u2019t speak of it, so as not to let myself in for bores. You might bring your cousin to stay. She would get a change of air from Balbec. With this air here, I maintain I can cure incurables. I have cured them, I may tell you, and not only this time. For I have stayed quite close to here before, a place I discovered and got for a mere song, a very different style of house from their Raspelicre. I can shew you it if we go for a drive together. But I admit that even here the air is invigorating. Still, I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, the whole of Paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner. That has always been my luck. Anyhow, give your cousin my message. We shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley, you ought to see it in the morning, with the sun shining on the mist! By the way, who is this Robert de Saint-Loup of whom you were speaking?\u201d she said with a troubled air, for she had heard that I was to pay him a visit at Donci\u00e8res, and was afraid that he might make me fail her. \u201cWhy not bring him here instead, if he\u2019s not a bore. I have heard of him from Morel; I fancy he\u2019s one of his greatest friends,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin with entire want of truth, for Saint-Loup and Morel were not even aware of one another\u2019s existence. But having heard that Saint-Loup knew M. de Charlus, she supposed that it was through the violinist, and wished to appear to know all about them. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking up medicine, by any chance, or literature? You know, if you want any help about examinations, Cottard can do anything, and I make what use of him I please. As for the Academy later on, for I suppose he\u2019s not old enough yet, I have several notes in my pocket. Your friend would find himself on friendly soil here, and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house. Life\u2019s not very exciting at Donci\u00e8res. But you shall do just what you please, then you can arrange what you think best,\u201d she concluded, without insisting, so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth, and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful, to wit despotism, was named liberty. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you,\u201d she said, at the sight of M. Verdurin who, with gestures of impatience, was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawing-room above the valley, like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air. \u201cHas Saniette been annoying you again? But you know what an idiot he is, you have to resign yourself to him, don\u2019t work yourself up into such a state. I dislike this sort of thing,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbecause it is bad for him, it sends the blood to his head. But I must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with Saniette, and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house. For my part I must admit that he\u2019s so gloriously silly, I can\u2019t help enjoying him. I dare say you heard what he said after dinner: \u2018I can\u2019t play whist, but I can the piano.\u2019 Isn\u2019t it superb? It is positively colossal, and incidentally quite untrue, for he knows nothing at all about either. But my husband, beneath his rough exterior, is very sensitive, very kind-hearted, and Saniette\u2019s self-centred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy. Come, dear, calm yourself, you know Cottard told you that it was bad for your liver. And it is I that will have to bear the brunt of it all,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cTo-morrow Saniette will come back all nerves and tears. Poor man, he is very ill indeed. Still, that is no reason why he should kill other people. Besides, even at times when he is in pain, when one would like to be sorry for him, his silliness hardens one\u2019s heart. He is really too stupid. You have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill, and he is not to come again, since that\u2019s what he\u2019s most afraid of, it will have a soothing effect on his nerves,\u201d Mme. Verdurin whispered to her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right. But those on the other side shewed the valley, now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight. Now and again one heard the voices of Morel and Cottard. \u201cYou have a trump?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAh! You\u2019re in luck, you are,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Morel, in answer to his question, for he had seen that the doctor\u2019s hand was full of trumps. \u201cHere comes the lady of diamonds,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s a trump, you know? My trick. But there isn\u2019t a Sorbonne any longer,\u201d said the doctor to M. de Cambremer; \u201cthere\u2019s only the University of Paris.\u201d M. de Cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him. \u201cI thought you were talking about the Sorbonne,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cI heard you say: tu nous la sors bonne,\u201d he added, with a wink, to shew that this was meant for a pun. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d he said, pointing to his adversary, \u201cI have a Trafalgar in store for him.\u201d And the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor, for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter, which in his family, in the \u2018breed\u2019 of the Cottards, was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction. In the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement. Cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously, but one fine day, nobody ever knew by whose intervention, wifely, professorial perhaps, the rubbing of the hands had disappeared. The doctor even at dominoes, when he got his adversary on the run, and made him take the double six, which was to him the keenest of pleasures, contented himself with shaking his shoulders. And when \u2014 which was as seldom as possible \u2014 he went down to his native village for a few days, and met his first cousin, who was still at the hand-rubbing stage, he would say to Mme. Cottard on his return: \u201cI thought poor Ren\u00e9 very common.\u201d \u201cHave you the little dee-ar?\u201d he said, turning to Morel. \u201cNo? Then I play this old David.\u201d \u201cThen you have five, you have won!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great victory, Doctor,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cA Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Cottard, turning to face the Marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark. \u201cIf there is still time,\u201d he said to Morel, \u201cI give you your revenge. It is my deal. Ah! no, here come the carriages, it will have to be Friday, and I shall shew you a trick you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d M. and Mme. Verdurin accompanied us to the door. The Mistress was especially coaxing with Saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up, my boy,\u201d said M. Verdurin, whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone. \u201cOne would say the weather had changed.\u201d These words filled me with joy, as though the profoundly hidden life, the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature, hinted at other changes, these occurring in my own life, and created fresh possibilities in it. Merely by opening the door upon the park, before leaving, one felt that a different \u2018weather\u2019 had, at that mo-merit, taken possession of the scene; cooling breezes, one of the joys of summer, were rising in the fir plantation (where long ago Mme. de Cambremer had dreamed of Chopin) and almost imperceptibly, in caressing coils, capricious eddies, were beginning their gentle nocturnes. I declined the rug which, on subsequent evenings, I was to accept when Albertine was with me, more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold. A vain search was made for the Norwegian philosopher. Had he been seized by a colic? Had he been afraid of missing the train? Had an aeroplane come to fetch him? Had he been carried aloft in an Assumption? In any case he had vanished without anyone\u2019s noticing his departure, like a god. \u201cYou are unwise,\u201d M. de Cambremer said to me, \u201cit\u2019s as cold as charity.\u201d \u201cWhy charity?\u201d the doctor inquired. \u201cBeware of choking,\u201d the Marquis went on. \u201cMy sister never goes out at night. However, she is in a pretty bad state at present. In any case you oughtn\u2019t to stand about bare-headed, put your tile on at once.\u201d \u201cThey are not frigorifie chokings,\u201d said Cottard sententiously. \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d M. de Cambremer bowed. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your opinion. . . . \u201d \u201cOpinions of the press!\u201d said the doctor, smiling round his glasses. M. de Cambremer laughed, but, feeling certain that he was in the right, insisted: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said, \u201cwhenever my sister goes out after dark, she has an attack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use quibbling,\u201d replied the doctor, regardless of his want of manners. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t practise medicine by the seaside, unless I am called in for a consultation. I am here on holiday.\u201d He was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked. M. de Cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together: \u201cWe are fortunate in having quite close to us (not on your side of the Day, on the opposite side, but it is quite narrow at that point) another medical celebrity, Doctor du Boulbon,\u201d Cottard, who, as a rule, from \u2018deontology,\u2019 abstained from criticising his colleagues, could not help exclaiming, as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino: \u201cBut he is not a doctor. He practises \u2018a literary medicine, it is all fantastic therapeutics, charlatanism. All the same, we are on quite good terms. I should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit, if I weren\u2019t leaving.\u201d But, from the air which Cottard assumed in speaking of du Boulbon to M. de Cambremer, I felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which, in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor, Virgil (who took all their patients from them as well), the doctors of Salerno had chartered, but which sank with them on the voyage. \u201cGood-bye, my dear Saniette, don\u2019t forget to come to-morrow, you know how my husband enjoys seeing you. He enjoys your wit, your intellect; yes indeed, you know quite well, he takes sudden moods, but he can\u2019t live without seeing you. It\u2019s always the first thing he asks me: \u2018Is Saniette coming? I do so enjoy seeing him.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d said M. Verdurin to Saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the Mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated Saniette. Then looking at his watch, doubtless so as not to prolong the leave-taking in the damp night air, he warned the coachmen not to lose any time, but to be careful when going down the hill, and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train. This was to set down the faithful, one at one station, another at another, ending with myself, for no one else was going as far as Balbec, and beginning with the Cambremers. They, so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la Raspeli\u00e8re at night, took the train with us at Douville-F\u00e9terne. The station nearest to them was indeed not this, which, being already at some distance from the village, was farther still from the mansion, but la Sogne. On arriving at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, M. de Cambremer made a point of giving a \u2018piece,\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to say, to the Verdurins\u2019 coachman (the nice, sensitive coachman, with melancholy thoughts), for M. de Cambremer was generous, and in that respect took, rather, \u2018after his mamma.\u2019 But, possibly because his \u2018papa\u2019s\u2019 strain intervened at this point, he felt a scruple, or else that there might be a mistake \u2014 either on his part, if, for instance, in the dark, he were to give a you instead of a franc, or on the recipient\u2019s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him. And so he drew attention to it: \u201cIt is a franc I\u2019m giving you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to the coachman, turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight, and so that the faithful might report his action to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Twenty sous is right, as it\u2019s only a short drive.\u201d He and Mme. de Cambremer left us at la Sogne. \u201cI shall tell my sister,\u201d he repeated to me, \u201cthat you have choking fits, I am sure she will be interested.\u201d I understood that he meant: \u2018will be pleased.\u2019 As for his wife, she employed, in saying good-bye to me, two abbreviations which, even in writing, used to shock me at that time in a letter, although one has grown accustomed to them since, but which, when spoken, seem to me to-day even to contain in their deliberate carelessness, in their acquired familiarity, something insufferably pedantic: \u201cPleased to have met you,\u201d she said to me; \u201cgreetings to Saint-Loup, if you see him.\u201d In making this speech, Mme. de Cambremer pronounced the name \u2018Saint-Loupe.\u2019 I have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing, or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced. However it may be, for some weeks afterwards, she continued to say \u2018Saint-Loupe\u2019 and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same. If other people said \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 they would insist, would say emphatically \u2018Saint-Loupe,\u2019 whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them. But, no doubt, women of greater brilliance than Mme. de Cambremer told her, or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation, and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society, for shortly afterwards Mme. de Cambremer was again saying \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out, whether because she had lectured him, or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant, and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction, energy and ambition had yielded, it must have been on good grounds. The worst of her admirers was her husband. Mme. de Cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent. As soon as she began to attack me, or anyone else, in this fashion, M. de Cambremer would start watching her victim, laughing the while. As the Marquis had a squint \u2014 a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles \u2014 the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye. So a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky. His monocle moreover protected, like the glass over a valuable picture, this delicate operation. As for the actual intention of his laughter, it was hard to say whether it was friendly: \u201cAh! You rascal! You\u2019re in an enviable position, aren\u2019t you. You have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit!\u201d Or coarse: \u201cWell, Sir, I hope you\u2019ll learn your lesson, you\u2019ve got to eat a slice of humble pie.\u201d Or obliging: \u201cI\u2019m here, you know, I take it with a laugh because it\u2019s all pure fun, but I shan\u2019t let you be ill-treated.\u201d Or cruelly accessory: \u201cI don\u2019t need to add my little pinch of salt, but you can see, I\u2019m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you. I\u2019m wriggling like a hunchback, therefore I approve, I, the husband. And so, if you should take it into your head to answer back, you would have me to deal with, my young Sir. I should first of all give you a pair of resounding smacks, well aimed, then we should go and cross swords in the forest of Chantepie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the correct interpretation of the husband\u2019s merriment, the wife\u2019s whimsies soon came to an end. Whereupon M. de Cambremer ceased to laugh, the temporary pupil vanished and as one had forgotten for a minute or two to expect an entirely white eyeball, it gave this ruddy Norman an air at once anaemic and ecstatic, as though the Marquis had just undergone an operation, or were imploring heaven, through his monocle, for the palms of martyrdom", "http://genius.com/Marcel-proust-chapter-2-lyrics"], "690448": ["Chairs by\u00a0Tristam", "Chairs Lyrics\n\n[Verse]\n(Sit on the...)\nSit on the chair\n(Sit on the...)\nCan you please sit on the chair?\n(Sit on the...)\nI'm not gonna say it 3 times\n(Sit on the...)\nERIC!

Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship.

Yes... Giza, Karnak, Thebes... I see them now once more! In the grip of a waking dream, I walk those restless sands again. Egypt... here my journey began, and here I took the first steps towards destiny... and damnation\n(The events recounted here take place before \"The Dreamer In The Catacombs Of Ur\")\n\nFrom the expeditionary journal of Doctor Ignatius X. Stone:\n\nGiza, Egypt (March 17, 1890)\nThe heat here is damnably oppressive, and all day the omnipresent sand has been whipped up by an impudent wind, making progress all the more difficult. At dawn, I pinpointed the location of the Great Pyramid's secret chamber which my old friend Professor Caleb Blackthorne and his benefactor Lord Blakiston had discovered several months previously, but ingress to its concealed depths was denied me by a partial collapse of the age old edifice's stone ceiling. Excavation is evidently impossible, lest more of the mighty tomb come crashing down about us. At any rate, Blackthorne has studied the incredible inscriptions within that hidden alcove exhaustively, and in truth my own interests lie elsewhere in this desolate sand-flayed landscape. The traditionalists believe that, in keeping with Egyptian tenets, only mundane things such as new air shafts and ever more ornate sarcophagi are yet to be discovered deep within the tunnel networks of these cyclopean monuments. Feh! If only they knew the true extent of this great cosmic puzzle! They are as fools who view a tapestry in a darkened room by the light of only one candle, seeing only small sections illuminated one by one, and refusing to recognize or connect the darkened and unseen areas to the entirety\nWorking from the geometric calculations which I prepared before our arrival here, I have studied the alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos. It is as I suspected. Tomorrow, I leave the the imperious and hoary mausoleum of Khufu and seek answers within the Great Temple of Karnak...\n\nKarnak, Egypt (March 18, 1890)\nWhat oblations to the grim chthonic deities of the ancient world were once offered solemnly beneath the stygian skies of this sweltering place, I wonder? What sublime power awaits the aspirant, the querent who dares seek answers in those shadowed places where men of lesser fortitude fear to gaze? Blackthorne often berates me for what he calls my preoccupation with the arcane, the occult, the sinistrous lore of the chthonic... he insists no good will come of such delving into nighted realms. Ha! The path to elucidation is seldom devoid of thorns, the road to knowledge rarely free of perils! I seek enlightenment, and by the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I may have found it! Ancient tradition of this land has long spoken of strange flashes of light emanating from the depths of pyramid passages and temple catacombs. Over a thousand years ago the Arabs wrote of the transient walls and hidden chambers of these monuments; of secret doors moved by an unseen force and of implacable sentries who guarded the secrets of the temples with dour tenacity. What I found this evening gives credence to all that and more. Is the lore which I discovered carved into the ancient stone of Karnak's temple the next fragment of the cryptic conundrum which I have dedicated my life to solving? The Coptic papyrus states that, upon the walls of the pyramids and the temples were inscribed the mysteries of science, astronomy, geometry and physics; inscriptions of unknown peoples and lost civilizations whose lore was carved into the stone to preserve it from the ravages of the great deluge. The surviving knowledge of long forgotten antediluvian races!\nAye, prudent Surid, heeding the warnings of his priests, erected certain repositories of long forgotten knowledge to withstand first a great flood, and then an all-consuming fire which was prophesied would come from the sky. Masoudi, in the tenth century, described automata; titanic guardians of stone and metal which were placed to guard the treasures and the entombed lore, and which were tasked to destroy all those deemed unworthy, all those who dared enter the chambers unbidden. I see them! The hoary sentinels of Karnak unfettered! Rising from their sandy tombs to smite the intruder, the raider and the interloper with righteous fury! And what is this... was there once a glimmer of life within the sightless stone eyes of the Theban guardian? Does the silent watcher at Giza even now descend from its granite dias to once more stalk the shifting sands on carven claws? Hu! Horem-akhet!\n\nThe alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos revealed\nChthonic lore concealed in Khufu's imperious mausoleum\nBy the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I have found the answers\nArcane secrets inscribed in the ancient Coptic papyrus\nThe Pyramid's legacy compells me to these dark discoveries\nThe Theban guardian rises from its sandy tomb to meet us\nThe Silent Watcher stalks, behold the Sentinels of Karnak!\n\nThebes, Egypt (March 19, 1890)\nNiut-Ammon! Lucidity has reasserted its blessed hold upon me. I understand now the true nature of that knowledge which was revealed to me deep within the shadowed confines of Karnak's timeless temple. Telluric energy, harnessed by the ancients... triggered by lunar rays and solar radiation, channeled to impart static charges to rock strata and lines of natural power running through the earth. Neuro-electric energy generated, developed, creating light, separating inertia from gravity! And what more? The fourth state of matter, forged countless millennia ago in the hearts of burning stars... fettered, channeled, for creation and destruction! The secret of the great monuments of the ancients! Yes, secrets... answers. A rogue celestial body passes inside the orbit of the moon, becoming a captive of the earth's gravitational field. The world tilts upon its axis, its revolution slows, the planet shifts farther from its parent star... one of many such cataclysms. Asteroid strikes, floods, firestorms, the sky swathed in a veil of darkness through which the sun's light cannot pass, great ice-ages enshrouding the globe. And what is this? The forces of evil, of chaos... servitors of the sinister gods of the universe... manifesting upon the tellurian sphere? What dire agents of malignity were unleashed upon mankind? Bringers of carnage and destruction, pestilence and decay! The Z'xulth!\nSecrets once known by the forgotten peoples... ancient Atlantis... time-lost Lemuria... Hyperborea, Ultima Thule, utopian Atland and its enduring legacy. Fragments, memories... descendants... the Incas, the Aztecs, the Maya, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Britons, the Frisians, the ancient Sumerians. Yes, it is clear to me, like a diamond worked to perfection in the skilled hands of a master craftsman. The sigils and glyphs I beheld carved into the ancient stone of Karnak (which I somehow understood implicitly), the visions I experienced within the temple, it is all quite clearly compelling me to the next stage in my grand voyage of enlightenment. According to the inscriptions, the truth, the key, awaits me within the ziggurats of ancient Sumeria. I hear the call of the ancients, beckoning me to that aeon-veiled place across the unforgiving sands. We shall depart at once. I feel sure I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities. Yes, I shall surely meet my destiny within the mystery-haunted catacombs of ancient Ur...\n\n(From the pyramids of Egypt, to the ziggurats of Sumeria, my grand journey of enlightenment must continue. Praise the Ancients!)\n\nThe Keeper of the Ancient Lore of Ur:\nHearken to the warnings of the Ancients... tread softly those sacred and unforgiving sands. Do not break the seal of the seventh city!\n\nThe Chief Cultist of Ur:\nThe Gate must not be opened. You dare not awaken the Dreamer!\n\nCuneiform tablets bear a grim, darkly portentous warning\nSumerian catacombs astir with vile Chthonic horrors\nThe lore of Babylon inscribed in stone as old as Atlantis\nGlyphs and sigils now compell me to the ziggurats...\n\nIn a waking dream, I hear the call of the Ancients. I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities... in the Catacombs of Ur!\n\n(For the outcome of Doctor Ignatius Stone's expedition to Ur, see \"The Dreamer In The Catacombs Of Ur\" on the fifth Bal-Sagoth album, \"Atlantis Ascendant\".)", "http://genius.com/Bal-sagoth-unfettering-the-hoary-sentinels-of-karnak-lyrics"], "710594": ["Die romantische Schule - Kapitel 3 by\u00a0Heinrich\u00a0Heine", "Die romantische Schule - Kapitel 3 Lyrics\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Erstes Buch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frau von Sta\u00ebls Werk \u00bbDe l'Allemagne\u00ab ist die einzige umfassende Kunde, welche die Franzosen \u00fcber das geistige Leben Deutschlands erhalten haben. Und doch ist, seitdem dieses Buch erschienen, ein gro\u00dfer Zeitraum verflossen, und eine ganz neue Literatur hat sich unterdessen in Deutschland entfaltet. Ist es nur eine \u00dcbergangsliteratur? hat sie schon ihre Bl\u00fcte erreicht? ist sie bereits abgewelkt? Hier\u00fcber sind die Meinungen geteilt. Die meisten glauben, mit dem Tode Goethes beginne in Deutschland eine neue literarische Periode, mit ihm sei auch das alte Deutschland zu Grabe gegangen, die aristokratische Zeit der Literatur sei zu Ende, die demokratische beginne, oder, wie sich ein franz\u00f6sischer Journalist j\u00fcngst ausdr\u00fcckte: \u00bbder Geist der einzelnen habe aufgeh\u00f6rt, der Geist aller habe angefangen\u00ab.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was mich betrifft, so vermag ich nicht in so bestimmter Weise \u00fcber die k\u00fcnftigen Evolutionen des deutschen Geistes abzuurteilen. Die Endschaft der \u00bbGoetheschen Kunstperiode\u00ab, mit welchem Namen ich diese Periode zuerst bezeichnete, habe ich jedoch schon seit vielen Jahren vorausgesagt. Ich hatte gut prophezeien! Ich kannte sehr gut die Mittel und Wege jener Unzufriedenen, die dem Goetheschen Kunstreich ein Ende machen wollten, und in den damaligen Emeuten gegen Goethe will man sogar mich selbst gesehen haben. Nun Goethe tot ist, bem\u00e4chtigt sich meiner darob ein wunderbarer Schmerz.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indem ich diese Bl\u00e4tter gleichsam als eine Fortsetzung des Frau v. Sta\u00eblschen \u00bbDe l'Allemagne\u00ab ank\u00fcndige, mu\u00df ich, die Belehrung r\u00fchmend, die man aus diesem Werke sch\u00f6pfen kann, dennoch eine gewisse Vorsicht beim Gebrauche desselben anempfehlen und es durchaus als Koteriebuch bezeichnen. Frau v. Sta\u00ebl glorreichen Andenkens, hat hier in der Form eines Buches gleichsam einen Salon er\u00f6ffnet, worin sie deutsche Schriftsteller empfing und ihnen Gelegenheit gab, sich der franz\u00f6sischen zivilisierten Welt bekannt zu machen; aber in dem Get\u00f6se der verschiedensten Stimmen, die aus diesem Buche hervorschreien, h\u00f6rt man doch immer am vernehmlichsten den feinen Diskant des Herrn A.W. Schlegel. Wo sie ganz selbst ist, wo die gro\u00dff\u00fchlende Frau sich unmittelbar ausspricht mit ihrem ganzen strahlenden Herzen, mit dem ganzen Feuerwerk ihrer Geistesraketen und brillanten Tollheiten: da ist das Buch gut und vortrefflich. Sobald sie aber fremden Einfl\u00fcsterungen gehorcht, sobald sie einer Schule huldigt, deren Wesen ihr ganz fremd und unbegreifbar ist, sobald sie durch die Anpreisung dieser Schule gewisse ultramontane Tendenzen bef\u00f6rdert, die mit ihrer protestantischen Klarheit in direktem Widerspruche sind: da ist ihr Buch kl\u00e4glich und ungenie\u00dfbar. Dazu k\u00f6mmt noch, da\u00df sie au\u00dfer den unbewu\u00dften auch noch bewu\u00dfte Parteilichkeiten aus\u00fcbt, da\u00df sie durch die Lobpreisung des geistigen Lebens, des Idealismus in Deutschland eigentlich den damaligen Realismus der Franzosen, die materielle Herrlichkeit der Kaiserperiode, frondieren will. Ihr Buch \u00bbDe l'Allemagne\u00ab gleicht in dieser Hinsicht der \u00bbGermania\u00ab des Tacitus, der vielleicht ebenfalls durch seine Apologie der Deutschen eine indirekte Satire gegen seine Landsleute schreiben wollte.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wenn ich oben einer Schule erw\u00e4hnte, welcher Frau v. Sta\u00ebl huldigte, und deren Tendenzen sie bef\u00f6rderte: so meinte ich die romantische Schule. Da\u00df diese in Deutschland ganz etwas anderes war, als was man in Frankreich mit diesem Namen bezeichnet, da\u00df ihre Tendenzen ganz verschieden waren von denen der franz\u00f6sischen Romantiker, das wird in den folgenden Bl\u00e4ttern klarwerden.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was war aber die romantische Schule in Deutschland?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sie war nichts anders als die Wiedererweckung der Poesie des Mittelalters, wie sie sich in dessen Liedern, Bild- und Bauwerken, in Kunst und Leben manifestiert hatte. Diese Poesie aber war aus dem Christentume hervorgegangen, sie war eine Passionsblume, die dem Blute Christi entsprossen. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob die melancholische Blume, die wir in Deutschland Passionsblume benamsen, auch in Frankreich diese Benennung f\u00fchrt, und ob ihr von der Volkssage ebenfalls jener mystische Ursprung zugeschrieben wird. Es ist jene sonderbare mi\u00dffarbige Blume, in deren Kelch man die Marterwerkzeuge, die bei der Kreuzigung Christi gebraucht worden, n\u00e4mlich Hammer, Zange, N\u00e4gel usw., abkonterfeit sieht, eine Blume, die durchaus nicht h\u00e4\u00dflich, sondern nur gespenstisch ist, ja, deren Anblick sogar ein grauenhaftes Vergn\u00fcgen in unserer Seele erregt, gleich den krampfhaft s\u00fc\u00dfen Empfindungen, die aus dem Schmerze selbst hervorgehen. In solcher Hinsicht w\u00e4re diese Blume das geeignetste Symbol f\u00fcr das Christentum selbst, dessen schauerlichster Reiz eben in der Wollust des Schmerzes besteht.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obgleich man in Frankreich unter dem Namen Christentum nur den r\u00f6mischen Katholizismus versteht, so mu\u00df ich doch besonders bevorworten, da\u00df ich nur von letzterem spreche. Ich spreche von jener Religion, in deren ersten Dogmen eine Verdammnis alles Fleisches enthalten ist, und die dem Geiste nicht blo\u00df eine Obermacht \u00fcber das Fleisch zugesteht, sondern auch dieses abt\u00f6ten will, um den Geist zu verherrlichen; ich spreche von jener Religion, durch deren unnat\u00fcrliche Aufgabe ganz eigentlich die S\u00fcnde und die Hypokrisie in die Welt gekommen, indem eben durch die Verdammnis des Fleisches die unschuldigsten Sinnenfreuden eine S\u00fcnde geworden und durch die Unm\u00f6glichkeit, ganz Geist zu sein, die Hypokrisie sich ausbilden mu\u00dfte; ich spreche von jener Religion, die ebenfalls durch die Lehre von der Verwerflichkeit aller irdischen G\u00fcter, von der auferlegten Hundedemut und Engelsgeduld die erprobteste St\u00fctze des Despotismus geworden. Die Menschen haben jetzt das Wesen dieser Religion erkannt, sie lassen sich nicht mehr mit Anweisungen auf den Himmel abspeisen, sie wissen, da\u00df auch die Materie ihr Gutes hat und nicht ganz des Teufels ist, und sie vindizieren jetzt die Gen\u00fcsse der Erde, dieses sch\u00f6nen Gottesgartens, unseres unver\u00e4u\u00dferlichen Erbteils. Eben weil wir alle Konsequenzen jenes absoluten Spiritualismus jetzt so ganz begreifen, d\u00fcrfen wir auch glauben, da\u00df die christkatholische Weltansicht ihre Endschaft erreicht. Denn jede Zeit ist eine Sphinx, die sich in den Abgrund st\u00fcrzt, sobald man ihr R\u00e4tsel gel\u00f6st hat. Keineswegs jedoch leugnen wir hier den Nutzen, den die christkatholische Weltansicht in Europa gestiftet. Sie war notwendig als eine heilsame Reaktion gegen den grauenhaft kolossalen Materialismus, der sich im r\u00f6mischen Reiche entfaltet hatte und alle geistige Herrlichkeit des Menschen zu vernichten drohte. Wie die schl\u00fcpfrigen Memoiren des vorigen Jahrhunderts gleichsam die pi\u00e8ces justificatives der franz\u00f6sischen Revolution bilden; wie uns der Terrorismus eines Comit\u00e9 du salut public als notwendige Arznei erscheint, wenn wir die Selbstbekenntnisse der franz\u00f6sischen vornehmen Welt seit der Regentschaft gelesen; so erkennt man auch die Heilsamkeit des aszetischen Spiritualismus, wenn man etwa den Petron oder den Apulejus gelesen, B\u00fccher, die man als pi\u00e8ces justificatives des Christentums betrachten kann. Das Fleisch war so frech geworden in dieser R\u00f6merwelt, da\u00df es wohl der christlichen Disziplin bedurfte, um es zu z\u00fcchtigen. Nach dem Gastmahl eines Trimalkion bedurfte man einer Hungerkur gleich dem Christentum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oder etwa, wie greise L\u00fcstlinge durch Rutenstreiche das erschlaffte Fleisch zu neuer Genu\u00dff\u00e4higkeit aufreizen: wollte das alternde Rom sich m\u00f6nchisch gei\u00dfeln lassen, um raffinierte Gen\u00fcsse in der Qual selbst und die Wollust im Schmerze zu finden? Schlimmer \u00dcberreiz! er raubte dem r\u00f6mischen Staatsk\u00f6rper die letzten Kr\u00e4fte. Nicht durch die Trennung in zwei Reiche ging Rom zugrunde; am Bosporus wie an der Tiber ward Rom verzehrt von demselben jud\u00e4ischen Spiritualismus, und hier wie dort ward die r\u00f6mische Geschichte ein langsames Dahinsterben, eine Agonie, die Jahrhunderte dauerte. Hat etwa das gemeuchelte Jud\u00e4a, indem es den R\u00f6mern seinen Spiritualismus bescherte, sich an dem siegenden Feinde r\u00e4chen wollen, wie einst der sterbende Zentaur, der dem Sohne Jupiters das verderbliche Gewand, das mit dem eignen Blute vergiftet war, so listig zu \u00fcberliefern wu\u00dfte? Wahrlich, Rom, der Herkules unter den V\u00f6lkern, wurde durch das jud\u00e4ische Gift so wirksam verzehrt, da\u00df Helm und Harnisch seinen welkenden Gliedern entsanken und seine imperatorische Schlachtstimme herabsiechte zu betendem Pfaffengewimmer und Kastratengetriller.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aber was den Greis entkr\u00e4ftet, das st\u00e4rkt den J\u00fcngling. Jener Spiritualismus wirkte heilsam auf die \u00fcbergesunden V\u00f6lker des Nordens; die allzu vollbl\u00fctigen barbarischen Leiber wurden christlich vergeistigt; es begann die europ\u00e4ische Zivilisation. Das ist eine preisw\u00fcrdige, heilige Seite des Christentums. Die katholische Kirche erwarb sich in dieser Hinsicht die gr\u00f6\u00dften Anspr\u00fcche auf unsere Verehrung und Bewunderung. Sie hat durch gro\u00dfe, geniale Institutionen die Bestialit\u00e4t der nordischen Barbaren zu z\u00e4hmen und die brutale Materie zu bew\u00e4ltigen gewu\u00dft.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die Kunstwerke des Mittelalters zeigen nun jene Bew\u00e4ltigung der Materie durch den Geist, und das ist oft sogar ihre ganze Aufgabe. Die epischen Dichtungen jener Zeit k\u00f6nnte man leicht nach dem Grade dieser Bew\u00e4ltigung klassifizieren.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Von lyrischen und dramatischen Gedichten kann hier nicht die Rede sein; denn letztere existierten nicht, und erstere sind sich ziemlich \u00e4hnlich in jedem Zeitalter, wie die Nachtigallenlieder in jedem Fr\u00fchling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obgleich die epische Poesie des Mittelalters in heilige und profane geschieden war, so waren doch beide Gattungen ihrem Wesen nach ganz christlich; denn wenn die heilige Poesie auch ausschlie\u00dflich das j\u00fcdische Volk, welches f\u00fcr das allein heilige galt, und dessen Geschichte, welche allein die heilige hie\u00df, die Helden des Alten und Neuen Testamentes, die Legende, kurz die Kirche besang, so spiegelte sich doch in der profanen Poesie das ganze damalige Leben mit allen seinen christlichen Anschauungen und Bestrebungen. Die Bl\u00fcte der heiligen Dichtkunst im deutschen Mittelalter ist vielleicht \u00bbBarlaam und Josaphat\u00ab, ein Gedicht, worin die Lehre von der Abnegation, von der Enthaltsamkeit, von der Entsagung, von der Verschm\u00e4hung aller weltlichen Herrlichkeit am konsequentesten ausgesprochen worden. Hiern\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich den \u00bbLobgesang auf den heiligen Anno\u00ab f\u00fcr das Beste der heiligen Gattung halten. Aber dieses letztere Gedicht greift schon weit hinaus ins Weltliche. Es unterscheidet sich \u00fcberhaupt von den ersteren wie etwa ein byzantinisches Heiligenbild von einem altdeutschen. Wie auf jenen byzantinischen Gem\u00e4lden, sehen wir ebenfalls in \u00bbBarlaam und Josaphat\u00ab die h\u00f6chste Einfachheit, nirgends ist perspektivisches Beiwerk, und die lang mageren, statuen\u00e4hnlichen Leiber und die idealisch ernsthaften Gesichter treten streng abgezeichnet hervor, wie aus weichem Goldgrund; \u2013 im \u00bbLobgesang auf den heiligen Anno\u00ab wird, wie auf altdeutschen Gem\u00e4lden, das Beiwerk fast zur Hauptsache, und trotz der grandiosen Anlage ist doch das einzelne aufs kleinlichste ausgef\u00fchrt, und man wei\u00df nicht, ob man dabei die Konzeption eines Riesen oder die Geduld eines Zwergs bewundern soll. Ottfrieds Evangeliengedicht, das man als das Hauptwerk der heiligen Poesie zu r\u00fchmen pflegt, ist lange nicht so ausgezeichnet wie die erw\u00e4hnten beiden Dichtungen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In der profanen Poesie finden wir nach obiger Andeutung zuerst den Sagenkreis der Nibelungen und des Heldenbuchs; da herrscht noch die ganze vorchristliche Denk- und Gef\u00fchlsweise, da ist die rohe Kraft noch nicht zum Rittertum herabgemildert, da stehen noch wie Steinbilder die starren K\u00e4mpen des Nordens, und das sanfte Licht und der sittige Atem des Christentums dringt noch nicht durch die eisernen R\u00fcstungen. Aber es d\u00e4mmert allm\u00e4hlich in den altgermanischen W\u00e4ldern, die alten G\u00f6tzeneichen werden gef\u00e4llt, und es entsteht ein lichter Kampfplatz, wo der Christ mit dem Heiden k\u00e4mpft, und dieses sehen wir im Sagenkreis Karls des Gro\u00dfen, worin sich eigentlich die Kreuzz\u00fcge mit ihren heiligen Tendenzen abspiegeln. Nun aber, aus der christlich spiritualisierten Kraft, entfaltet sich die eigent\u00fcmlichste Erscheinung des Mittelalters, das Rittertum, das sich endlich noch sublimiert als ein geistliches Rittertum. Jenes, das weltliche Rittertum, sehen wir am anmutigsten verherrlicht in dem Sagenkreis des K\u00f6nigs Artus, worin die s\u00fc\u00dfeste Galanterie, die ausgebildetste courtoisie und die abenteuerlichste Kampflust herrscht. Aus den s\u00fc\u00df n\u00e4rrischen Arabesken und phantastischen Blumengebilden dieser Gedichte gr\u00fc\u00dfen uns der k\u00f6stliche Iwein, der vortreffliche Lanzelot vom See und der tapfere, galante, honette, aber etwas langweilige Wigalois. Neben diesem Sagenkreis sehen wir den damit verwandten und verwebten Sagenkreis vom \u00bbheiligen Gral\u00ab, worin das geistliche Rittertum verherrlicht wird, und da treten uns entgegen drei der grandiosesten Gedichte des Mittelalters, der \u00bbTiturel\u00ab, der \u00bbParzival\u00ab und der \u00bbLohengrin\u00ab; hier stehen wir der romantischen Poesie gleichsam pers\u00f6nlich gegen\u00fcber, wir schauen ihr tief hinein in die gro\u00dfen leidenden Augen, und sie umstrickt uns unversehens mit ihrem scholastischen Netzwerk und zieht uns hinab in die wahnwitzige Tiefe der mittelalterlichen Mystik. Endlich sehen wir aber auch Gedichte in jener Zeit, die dem christlichen Spiritualismus nicht unbedingt huldigen, ja worin dieser sogar frondiert wird, wo der Dichter sich den Ketten der abstrakten christlichen Tugenden entwindet und wohlgef\u00e4llig sich hinabtaucht in die Genu\u00dfwelt der verherrlichten Sinnlichkeit; und es ist eben nicht der schlechteste Dichter, der uns das Hauptwerk dieser Richtung, \u00bbTristan und Isolde\u00ab, hinterlassen hat. Ja, ich mu\u00df gestehen, Gottfried von Stra\u00dfburg, der Verfasser dieses sch\u00f6nsten Gedichts des Mittelalters, ist vielleicht auch dessen gr\u00f6\u00dfter Dichter, und er \u00fcberragt noch alle Herrlichkeit des Wolfram von Eschilbach, den wir im \u00bbParzival\u00ab und in den Fragmenten des \u00bbTiturel\u00ab so sehr bewundern. Es ist vielleicht jetzt erlaubt, den Meister Gottfried unbedingt zu r\u00fchmen und zu preisen. Zu seiner Zeit hat man sein Buch gewi\u00df f\u00fcr gottlos und \u00e4hnliche Dichtungen, wozu schon der \u00bbLancelot\u00ab geh\u00f6rte, f\u00fcr gef\u00e4hrlich gehalten. Und es sind wirklich auch bedenkliche Dinge vorgefallen. Francesca da Polenta und ihr sch\u00f6ner Freund mu\u00dften teuer daf\u00fcr b\u00fc\u00dfen, da\u00df sie eines Tages miteinander in einem solchen Buche lasen; \u2013 die gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gefahr freilich bestand darin, da\u00df sie pl\u00f6tzlich zu lesen aufh\u00f6rten! Die Poesie in allen diesen Gedichten des Mittelalters tr\u00e4gt einen bestimmten Charakter, wodurch sie sich von der Poesie der Griechen und R\u00f6mer unterscheidet. In betreff dieses Unterschieds nennen wir erstere die romantische und letztere die klassische Poesie. Diese Benennungen aber sind nur unsichere Rubriken und f\u00fchrten bisher zu den unerquicklichsten Verwirrnissen, die noch gesteigert wurden, wenn man die antike Poesie statt klassisch auch plastisch nannte. Hier lag besonders der Grund zu Mi\u00dfverst\u00e4ndnissen. N\u00e4mlich die K\u00fcnstler sollen ihren Stoff immer plastisch bearbeiten, er mag christlich oder heidnisch sein, sie sollen ihn in klaren Umrissen darstellen, kurz: plastische Gestaltung soll in der romantisch modernen Kunst, ebenso wie in der antiken Kunst, die Hauptsache sein. Und in der Tat, sind nicht die Figuren in der \u00bbg\u00f6ttlichen Kom\u00f6die\u00ab des Dante oder auf den Gem\u00e4lden des Raffael ebenso plastisch wie die im Virgil oder auf den W\u00e4nden von Herkulanum? Der Unterschied besteht darin, da\u00df die plastischen Gestalten in der antiken Kunst ganz identisch sind mit dem Darzustellenden, mit der Idee, die der K\u00fcnstler darstellen wollte, z.B. da\u00df die Irrfahrten des Odysseus gar nichts anders bedeuten als die Irrfahrten des Mannes, der ein Sohn des Laertes und Gemahl der Penelopeia war und Odysseus hie\u00df; da\u00df ferner der Bacchus, den wir im Louvre sehen, nichts anders ist als der anmutige Sohn der Semele mit der k\u00fchnen Wehmut in den Augen und der heiligen Wollust in den gew\u00f6lbt weichen Lippen. Anders ist es in der romantischen Kunst; da haben die Irrfahrten eines Ritters noch eine esoterische Bedeutung, sie deuten vielleicht auf die Irrfahrten des Lebens \u00fcberhaupt; der Drache, der \u00fcberwunden wird, ist S\u00fcnde; der Mandelbaum, der dem Helden aus der Ferne so tr\u00f6stlich zuduftet, das ist die Dreieinigkeit, Gott-Vater und Gott-Sohn und Gott-Heiliger Geist, die zugleich Eins ausmachen, wie Nu\u00df, Faser und Kern dieselbe Mandel sind. Wenn Homer die R\u00fcstung eines Helden schildert, so ist es eben nichts andres als eine gute R\u00fcstung, die so und so viel Ochsen wert ist; wenn aber ein M\u00f6nch des Mittelalters in seinem Gedichte die R\u00f6cke der Muttergottes beschreibt, so kann man sich darauf verlassen, da\u00df er sich unter diesen R\u00f6cken ebenso viele verschiedene Tugenden denkt, da\u00df ein besonderer Sinn verborgen ist unter diesen heiligen Bedeckungen der unbefleckten Jungfrauschaft Maria, welche auch, da ihr Sohn der Mandelkern ist, ganz vern\u00fcnftigerweise als Mandelbl\u00fcte besungen wird. Das ist nun der Charakter der mittelalterlichen Poesie, die wir die romantische nennen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die klassische Kunst hatte nur das Endliche darzustellen, und ihre Gestalten konnten identisch sein mit der Idee des K\u00fcnstlers. Die romantische Kunst hatte das Unendliche und lauter spiritualistische Beziehungen darzustellen oder vielmehr anzudeuten, und sie nahm ihre Zuflucht zu einem System traditioneller Symbole oder vielmehr zum Parabolischen, wie schon Christus selbst seine spiritualistischen Ideen durch allerlei sch\u00f6ne Parabeln deutlich zu machen suchte. Daher das Mystische, R\u00e4tselhafte, Wunderbare und \u00dcberschwengliche in den Kunstwerken des Mittelalters; die Phantasie macht ihre entsetzlichsten Anstrengungen, das Reingeistige durch sinnliche Bilder darzustellen, und sie erfindet die kolossalsten Tollheiten, sie st\u00fclpt den Pelion auf den Ossa, den \u00bbParzival\u00ab auf den \u00bbTiturel\u00ab, um den Himmel zu erreichen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bei den V\u00f6lkern, wo die Poesie ebenfalls das Unendliche darstellen wollte und ungeheure Ausgeburten der Phantasie zum Vorschein kamen, z.B. bei den Skandinaviern und Indiern, finden wir Gedichte, die wir ebenfalls f\u00fcr romantisch halten und auch romantisch zu nennen pflegen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Von der Musik des Mittelalters k\u00f6nnen wir nicht viel sagen. Es fehlen uns die Urkunden. Erst sp\u00e4t, im sechzehnten Jahrhundert, entstanden die Meisterwerke der katholischen Kirchenmusik, die man in ihrer Art nicht genug sch\u00e4tzen kann, da sie den christlichen Spiritualismus am reinsten aussprechen. Die rezitierenden K\u00fcnste, spiritualistisch ihrer Natur nach, konnten im Christentum ein ziemliches Gedeihen finden. Minder vorteilhaft war diese Religion f\u00fcr die bildenden K\u00fcnste. Denn da auch diese den Sieg des Geistes \u00fcber die Materie darstellen sollten und dennoch ebendiese Materie als Mittel ihrer Darstellung gebrauchen mu\u00dften, so hatten sie gleichsam eine unnat\u00fcrliche Aufgabe zu l\u00f6sen. Daher in Skulptur und Malerei jene abscheulichen Themata: Martyrbilder, Kreuzigungen, sterbende Heilige, Zerst\u00f6rung des Fleisches. Die Aufgaben selbst waren ein Martyrium der Skulptur, und wenn ich jene verzerrten Bildwerke sehe, wo durch schieffromme K\u00f6pfe, lange, d\u00fcnne Arme, magere Beine und \u00e4ngstlich unbeholfene Gew\u00e4nder die christliche Abstinenz und Entsinnlichung dargestellt werden soll, so erfa\u00dft mich uns\u00e4gliches Mitleid mit den K\u00fcnstlern jener Zeit. Die Maler waren wohl etwas beg\u00fcnstigter, da das Material ihrer Darstellung, die Farbe, in seiner Unerfa\u00dfbarkeit, in seiner bunten Schattenhaftigkeit dem Spiritualismus nicht so derb widerstrebte wie das Material der Skulptoren; dennoch mu\u00dften auch sie, die Maler, mit den widerw\u00e4rtigsten Leidensgestalten die seufzende Leinwand belasten. Wahrlich, wenn man manche Gem\u00e4ldesammlung betrachtet und nichts als Blutszenen, St\u00e4upen und Hinrichtung dargestellt sieht, so sollte man glauben, die alten Meister h\u00e4tten diese Bilder f\u00fcr die Galerie eines Scharfrichters gemalt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aber der menschliche Genius wei\u00df sogar die Unnatur zu verkl\u00e4ren, vielen Malern gelang es, die unnat\u00fcrliche Aufgabe sch\u00f6n und erhebend zu l\u00f6sen, und namentlich die Italiener wu\u00dften der Sch\u00f6nheit etwas auf Kosten des Spiritualismus zu huldigen und sich zu jener Idealit\u00e4t emporzuschwingen, die in so vielen Darstellungen der Madonna ihre Bl\u00fcte erreicht hat. Die katholische Klerisei hat \u00fcberhaupt, wenn es die Madonna galt, dem Sensualismus immer einige Zugest\u00e4ndnisse gemacht. Dieses Bild einer unbefleckten Sch\u00f6nheit, die noch dabei von Mutterliebe und Schmerz verkl\u00e4rt ist, hatte das Vorrecht, durch Dichter und Maler gefeiert und mit allen sinnlichen Reizen geschm\u00fcckt zu werden. Denn dieses Bild war ein Magnet, welcher die gro\u00dfe Menge in den Scho\u00df des Christentums ziehen konnte. Madonna Maria war gleichsam die sch\u00f6ne Dame du comptoir der katholischen Kirche, die deren Kunden, besonders die Barbaren des Nordens, mit ihrem himmlischen L\u00e4cheln anzog und festhielt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die Baukunst trug im Mittelalter denselben Charakter wie die andern K\u00fcnste, wie denn \u00fcberhaupt damals alle Manifestationen des Lebens aufs wunderbarste miteinander harmonierten. Hier, in der Architektur, zeigt sich dieselbe parabolische Tendenz wie in der Dichtkunst. Wenn wir jetzt in einen alten Dom treten, ahnen wir kaum mehr den esoterischen Sinn seiner steinernen Symbolik. Nur der Gesamteindruck dringt uns unmittelbar ins Gem\u00fct. Wir f\u00fchlen hier die Erhebung des Geistes und die Zertretung des Fleisches. Das Innere des Doms selbst ist ein hohles Kreuz, und wir wandeln da im Werkzeuge des Martyriums selbst; die bunten Fenster werfen auf uns ihre roten und gr\u00fcnen Lichter wie Blutstropfen und Eiter; Sterbelieder umwimmern uns; unter unseren F\u00fc\u00dfen Leichensteine und Verwesung, und mit den kolossalen Pfeilern strebt der Geist in die H\u00f6he, sich schmerzlich losrei\u00dfend von dem Leib, der wie ein m\u00fcdes Gewand zu Boden sinkt. Wenn man sie von au\u00dfen erblickt, diese gotischen Dome, diese ungeheuren Bauwerke, die so luftig, so fein, so zierlich, so durchsichtig gearbeitet sind, da\u00df man sie f\u00fcr ausgeschnitzelt, da\u00df man sie f\u00fcr Brabanter Spitzen von Marmor halten sollte: dann f\u00fchlt man erst recht die Gewalt jener Zeit, die selbst den Stein so zu bew\u00e4ltigen wu\u00dfte, da\u00df er fast gespenstisch durchgeistet erscheint, da\u00df sogar diese h\u00e4rteste Materie den christlichen Spiritualismus ausspricht.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aber die K\u00fcnste sind nur der Spiegel des Lebens, und wie im Leben der Katholizismus erlosch, so verhallte und erblich er auch in der Kunst. Zur Zeit der Reformation schwand allm\u00e4hlich die katholische Poesie in Europa, und an ihrer Stelle sehen wir die l\u00e4ngst abgestorbene griechische Poesie wieder aufleben. Es war freilich nur ein k\u00fcnstlicher Fr\u00fchling, ein Werk des G\u00e4rtners und nicht der Sonne, und die B\u00e4ume und Blumen steckten in engen T\u00f6pfen, und ein Glashimmel sch\u00fctzte sie vor K\u00e4lte und Nordwind.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In der Weltgeschichte ist nicht jedes Ereignis die unmittelbare Folge eines anderen, alle Ereignisse bedingen sich vielmehr wechselseitig. Keineswegs blo\u00df durch die griechischen Gelehrten, die nach der Eroberung von Byzanz zu uns her\u00fcber emigriert, ist die Liebe f\u00fcr das Griechentum und die Sucht, es nachzuahmen, bei uns allgemein geworden, sondern auch in der Kunst wie im Leben regte sich ein gleichzeitiger Protestantismus; Leo X., der pr\u00e4chtige Mediz\u00e4er, war ein ebenso eifriger Protestant wie Luther; und wie man zu Wittenberg in lateinischer Prosa protestierte, so protestierte man zu Rom in Stein, Farbe und Ottaverime. Oder bilden die marmornen Kraftgestalten des Michelangelo, die lachenden Nymphengesichter des Guilio Romano und die lebenstrunkene Heiterkeit in den Versen des Meisters Ludovico nicht einen protestierenden Gegensatz zu dem altd\u00fcstern, abgeh\u00e4rmten Katholizismus? Die Maler Italiens polemisierten gegen das Pfaffentum vielleicht weit wirksamer als die s\u00e4chsischen Theologen. Das bl\u00fchende Fleisch auf den Gem\u00e4lden des Tizian, das ist alles Protestantismus. Die Lenden seiner Venus sind viel gr\u00fcndlichere Thesen als die, welche der deutsche M\u00f6nch an die Kirchent\u00fcre von Wittenberg angeklebt. \u2013 Es war damals, als h\u00e4tten die Menschen sich pl\u00f6tzlich erl\u00f6st gef\u00fchlt von tausendj\u00e4hrigem Zwang; besonders die K\u00fcnstler atmeten wieder frei, als ihnen der Alp des Christentums von der Brust gew\u00e4lzt schien; enthusiastisch st\u00fcrzten sie sich in das Meer griechischer Heiterkeit, aus dessen Schaum ihnen wieder die Sch\u00f6nheitsg\u00f6ttinnen entgegentauchten; die Maler malten wieder die ambrosische Freude des Olymps; die Bildhauer mei\u00dfelten wieder mit alter Lust die alten Heroen aus dem Marmorblock hervor; die Poeten besangen wieder das Haus des Atireus und des Lajos; es entstand die Periode der neuklassischen Poesie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wie sich in Frankreich unter Ludwig XIV. das moderne Leben am vollendetsten ausgebildet, so gewann hier jene neuklassische Poesie ebenfalls eine ausgebildete Vollendung, ja gewisserma\u00dfen eine selbst\u00e4ndige Originalit\u00e4t. Durch den politischen Einflu\u00df des gro\u00dfen K\u00f6nigs verbreitete sich diese neuklassische Poesie im \u00fcbrigen Europa; in Italien, wo sie schon einheimisch geworden war, erhielt sie ein franz\u00f6sisches Kolorit; mit den Anjous kamen auch die Helden der franz\u00f6sischen Trag\u00f6die nach Spanien; sie gingen nach England mit Madame Henriette, und wir Deutschen, wie sich von selbst versteht, wir bauten dem gepuderten Olymp von Versailles unsere t\u00f6lpischen Tempel. Der ber\u00fchmteste Oberpriester derselben war Gottsched, jene gro\u00dfe Allongeper\u00fccke, die unser teurer Goethe in seinen Memoiren so trefflich beschrieben hat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lessing war der literarische Arminius, der unser Theater von jener Fremdherrschaft befreite. Er zeigte uns die Nichtigkeit, die L\u00e4cherlichkeit, die Abgeschmacktheit jener Nachahmungen des franz\u00f6sischen Theaters, das selbst wieder dem griechischen nachgeahmt schien. Aber nicht blo\u00df durch seine Kritik, sondern auch durch seine eignen Kunstwerke ward er der Stifter der neuern deutschen Originalliteratur. Alle Richtungen des Geistes, alle Seiten des Lebens verfolgte dieser Mann mit Enthusiasmus und Uneigenn\u00fctzigkeit. Kunst, Theologie, Altertumswissenschaft, Dichtkunst, Theaterkritik, Geschichte, alles trieb er mit demselben Eifer und zu demselben Zwecke. In allen seinen Werken lebt dieselbe gro\u00dfe soziale Idee, dieselbe fortschreitende Humanit\u00e4t, dieselbe Vernunftreligion, deren Johannes er war, und deren Messias wir noch erwarten. Diese Religion predigte er immer, aber leider oft ganz allein und in der W\u00fcste. Und dann fehlte ihm auch die Kunst, den Stein in Brot zu verwandeln; er verbrachte den gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil seines Lebens in Armut und Drangsal; das ist ein Fluch, der fast auf allen gro\u00dfen Geistern der Deutschen lastet und vielleicht erst durch die politische Befreiung getilgt wird. Mehr, als man ahnte, war Lessing auch politisch bewegt, eine Eigenschaft, die wir bei seinen Zeitgenossen gar nicht finden; wir merken jetzt erst, was er mit der Schilderung des Duodezdespotismus in \u00bbEmilia Galotti\u00ab gemeint hat. Man hielt ihn damals nur f\u00fcr einen Champion der Geistesfreiheit und Bek\u00e4mpfer der klerikalen Intoleranz; denn seine theologischen Schriften verstand man schon besser. Die Fragmente \u00bb\u00fcber Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts\u00ab, welche Eugene Rodrigue ins Franz\u00f6sische \u00fcbersetzt hat, k\u00f6nnen vielleicht den Franzosen von der umfassenden Weite des Lessingschen Geistes einen Begriff geben. Die beiden kritischen Schriften, welche den meisten Einflu\u00df auf die Kunst ausge\u00fcbt, sind seine \u00bbHamburgische Dramaturgie\u00ab und sein \u00bbLaokoon, oder \u00fcber die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie\u00ab. Seine ausgezeichneten Theaterst\u00fccke sind: \u00bbEmilia Galotti\u00ab, \u00bbMinna von Barnhelm\u00ab und \u00bbNathan der Weise\u00ab.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gotthold Ephraim Lessing ward geboren zu Kamenz in der Lausitz den 22. Januar 1729 und starb zu Braunschweig den 15. Februar 1781. Er war ein ganzer Mann, der, wenn er mit seiner Polemik das Alte zerst\u00f6rend bek\u00e4mpfte, auch zu gleicher Zeit selber etwas Neues und Besseres schuf; \u00bber glich\u00ab, sagt ein deutscher Autor, \u00bbjenen frommen Juden, die beim zweiten Tempelbau von den Angriffen der Feinde oft gest\u00f6rt wurden und dann mit der einen Hand gegen diese k\u00e4mpften und mit der anderen Hand am Gotteshause weiter bauten.\u00ab Es ist hier nicht die Stelle, wo ich mehr von Lessing sagen d\u00fcrfte; aber ich kann nicht umhin zu bemerken, da\u00df er in der ganzen Literaturgeschichte derjenige Schriftsteller ist, den ich am meisten liebe. Noch eines anderen Schriftstellers, der in demselben Geiste und zu demselben Zwecke wirkte und Lessings n\u00e4chster Nachfolger genannt werden kann, will ich hier erw\u00e4hnen; seine W\u00fcrdigung geh\u00f6rt freilich ebenfalls nicht hierher, wie er denn \u00fcberhaupt in der Literaturgeschichte einen ganz einsamen Platz einnimmt und sein Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Zeit und Zeitgenossen noch immer nicht bestimmt ausgesprochen werden kann. Es ist Johann Gottfried Herder, geboren 1744 zu Mohrungen in Ostpreu\u00dfen und gestorben zu Weimar in Sachsen im Jahr 1803.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die Literaturgeschichte ist die gro\u00dfe Morgue, wo jeder seine Toten aufsucht, die er liebt, oder womit er verwandt ist. Wenn ich da unter so vielen unbedeutenden Leichen den Lessing oder den Herder sehe mit ihren erhabenen Menschengesichtern, dann pocht mir das Herz. Wie d\u00fcrfte ich vor\u00fcbergehen, ohne euch fl\u00fcchtig die blassen Lippen zu k\u00fcssen!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wenn aber Lessing die Nachahmerei des franz\u00f6sischen Aftergriechentums gar m\u00e4chtig zerst\u00f6rte, so hat er doch selbst eben durch seine Hinweisung auf die wirklichen Kunstwerke des griechischen Altertums gewisserma\u00dfen einer neuen Art t\u00f6richter Nachahmungen Vorschub geleistet. Durch seine Bek\u00e4mpfung des religi\u00f6sen Aberglaubens bef\u00f6rderte er sogar die n\u00fcchterne Aufkl\u00e4rungssucht, die sich zu Berlin breit machte und im seligen Nikolai ihr Hauptorgan und in der \u00bbAllgemeinen deutschen Bibliothek\u00ab ihr Arsenal besa\u00df. Die kl\u00e4glichste Mittelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit begann damals, widerw\u00e4rtiger als je ihr Wesen zu treiben, und das L\u00e4ppische und Leere blies sich auf wie der Frosch in der Fabel. Man irrt sehr, wenn man etwa glaubt, da\u00df Goethe, der damals schon aufgetaucht, bereits allgemein anerkannt gewesen sei. Sein \u00bbG\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\u00ab und sein \u00bbWerther\u00ab waren mit Begeisterung aufgenommen worden, aber die Werke der gew\u00f6hnlichsten St\u00fcmper waren es nicht minder, und man gab Goethen nur eine kleine Nische in dem Tempel der Literatur. Nur den \u00bbG\u00f6tz\u00ab und den \u00bbWerther\u00ab hatte das Publikum, wie gesagt, mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, aber mehr wegen des Stoffes als wegen ihrer artistischen Vorz\u00fcge, die fast niemand in diesen Meisterwerken zu sch\u00e4tzen verstand. Der \u00bbG\u00f6tz\u00ab war ein dramatisierter Ritterroman, und diese Gattung liebte man damals. In dem \u00bbWerther\u00ab sah man nur die Bearbeitung einer wahren Geschichte, die des jungen Jerusalem, eines J\u00fcnglings, der sich aus Liebe totgeschossen und dadurch in jener windstillen Zeit einen sehr starken L\u00e4rm gemacht; man las mit Tr\u00e4nen seine r\u00fchrenden Briefe; man bemerkte scharfsinnig, da\u00df die Art, wie Werther aus einer adeligen Gesellschaft entfernt worden, seinen Lebens\u00fcberdru\u00df gesteigert habe; die Frage \u00fcber den Selbstmord gab dem Buche noch mehr Besprechung; einige Narren verfielen auf die Idee, sich bei dieser Gelegenheit ebenfalls totzuschie\u00dfen; das Buch machte durch seinen Stoff einen bedeutenden Knalleffekt. Die Romane von August Lafontaine wurden jedoch ebenso gern gelesen, und da dieser unaufh\u00f6rlich schrieb, so war er ber\u00fchmter als Wolfgang Goethe. Wieland war der damalige gro\u00dfe Dichter, mit dem es etwa nur der Herr Odendichter Ramler zu Berlin in der Poesie aufnehmen konnte. Abg\u00f6ttisch wurde Wieland verehrt, mehr als jemals Goethe. Das Theater beherrschte Iffland mit seinen b\u00fcrgerlich larmoyanten Dramen und Kotzebue mit seinen banal witzigen Possen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diese Literatur war es, wogegen sich w\u00e4hrend den letzten Jahren des vorigen Jahrhunderts eine Schule in Deutschland erhob, die wir die romantische genannt, und als deren Gerants sich uns die Herren August Wilhelm und Friedrich Schlegel pr\u00e4sentiert haben. Jena, wo sich diese beiden Br\u00fcder nebst vielen gleichgestimmten Geistern auf und zu befanden, war der Mittelpunkt, von wo aus die neue \u00e4sthetische Doktrin sich verbreitete. Ich sage Doktrin, denn diese Schule begann mit Beurteilung der Kunstwerke der Vergangenheit und mit dem Rezept zu den Kunstwerken der Zukunft. In diesen beiden Richtungen hat die Schlegelsche Schule gro\u00dfe Verdienste um die \u00e4sthetische Kritik. Bei der Beurteilung der schon vorhandenen Kunstwerke wurden entweder ihre M\u00e4ngel und Gebrechen nachgewiesen, oder ihre Vorz\u00fcge und Sch\u00f6nheiten beleuchtet. In der Polemik, in jenem Aufdecken der artistischen M\u00e4ngel und Gebrechen, waren die Herren Schlegel durchaus die Nachahmer des alten Lessings, sie bem\u00e4chtigten sich seines gro\u00dfen Schlachtschwerts; nur war der Arm des Herrn August Wilhelm Schlegel viel zu zart schw\u00e4chlich und das Auge seines Bruders Friedrich viel zu mystisch umw\u00f6lkt, als da\u00df jener so stark und dieser so scharftreffend zuschlagen konnte wie Lessing. In der reproduzierenden Kritik aber, wo die Sch\u00f6nheiten eines Kunstwerks veranschaulicht werden, wo es auf ein feines Herausf\u00fchlen der Eigent\u00fcmlichkeiten ankam, wo diese zum Verst\u00e4ndnis gebracht werden mu\u00dften, da sind die Herren Schlegel dem alten Lessing ganz \u00fcberlegen. Was soll ich aber von ihren Rezepten f\u00fcr anzufertigende Meisterwerke sagen! Da offenbarte sich bei den Herren Schlegel eine  Ohnmacht, die wir ebenfalls bei Lessing zu finden glauben. Auch dieser, so stark er im Verneinen ist, so schwach ist er im Bejahen, selten kann er ein Grundprinzip aufstellen, noch seltener ein richtiges. Es fehlt ihm der feste Boden einer Philosophie, eines philosophischen Systems. Dieses ist nun bei den Herren Schlegel in noch viel trostloserem Grade der Fall. Man fabelt mancherlei von dem Einflu\u00df des Fichteschen Idealismus und der Schellingschen Naturphilosophie auf die romantische Schule, die man sogar ganz daraus hervorgehen l\u00e4\u00dft. Aber ich sehe hier h\u00f6chstens nur den Einflu\u00df einiger Fichteschen und Schellingschen Gedankenfragmente, keineswegs den Einflu\u00df einer Philosophie. Herr Schelling, der damals in Jena dozierte, hat aber jedenfalls pers\u00f6nlich gro\u00dfen Einflu\u00df auf die romantische Schule ausge\u00fcbt; er ist, was man in Frankreich nicht wei\u00df, auch ein St\u00fcck Poet, und es hei\u00dft, er sei noch zweifelhaft, ob er nicht seine s\u00e4mtlichen philosophischen Lehren in einem poetischen, ja metrischen Gewande herausgeben solle. Dieser Zweifel charakterisiert den Mann. Wenn aber die Herren Schlegel f\u00fcr die Meisterwerke, die sie sich bei den Poeten ihrer Schule bestellten, keine feste Theorie angeben konnten, so ersetzten sie diesen Mangel dadurch, da\u00df sie die besten Kunstwerke der Vergangenheit als Muster anpriesen und ihren Sch\u00fclern zug\u00e4nglich machten. Dieses waren nun haupts\u00e4chlich die Werke der christlich-katholischen Kunst des Mittelalters. Die \u00dcbersetzung des Shakespeares, der an der Grenze dieser Kunst steht und schon protestantisch klar in unsere moderne Zeit hereinl\u00e4chelt, war nur zu polemischen Zwecken bestimmt, deren Besprechung hier zu weitl\u00e4ufig w\u00e4re. Auch wurde diese \u00dcbersetzung von Herrn A.W. Schlegel unternommen zu einer Zeit, als man sich noch nicht ganz ins Mittelalter zur\u00fcck enthusiasmiert hatte. Sp\u00e4ter, als dieses geschah, ward der Calderon \u00fcbersetzt und weit \u00fcber den Shakespeare angepriesen; denn bei jenem fand man die Poesie des Mittelalters am reinsten ausgepr\u00e4gt, und zwar in ihren beiden Hauptmomenten, Rittertum und M\u00f6nchtum. Die frommen Kom\u00f6dien des kastilianischen Priesterdichters, dessen poetische Blumen mit Weihwasser besprengt und kirchlich ger\u00e4uchert sind, wurden jetzt nachgebildet mit all ihrer heiligen Grandezza, mit all ihrem sazerdotalen Luxus, mit all ihrer gebenedeiten Tollheit; und in Deutschland erbl\u00fchten nun jene buntgl\u00e4ubigen, n\u00e4rrisch tiefsinnigen Dichtungen, in welchen man sich mystisch verliebte, wie in der \u00bbAndacht zum Kreuz\u00ab, oder zur Ehre der Mutter Gottes schlug, wie im \u00bbStandhaften Prinzen\u00ab; und Zacharias Werner trieb das Ding so weit, wie man es nur treiben konnte, ohne von Obrigkeits wegen in ein Narrenhaus eingesperrt zu werden.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unsere Poesie, sagten die Herren Schlegel, ist alt, unsere Muse ist ein altes Weib mit einem Spinnrocken, unser Amor ist kein blonder Knabe, sondern ein verschrumpfter Zwerg mit grauen Haaren, unsere Gef\u00fchle sind abgewelkt, unsere Phantasie ist verdorrt; wir m\u00fcssen uns erfrischen, wir m\u00fcssen die versch\u00fctteten Quellen der naiven, einf\u00e4ltigsten Poesie des Mittelalters wieder aufsuchen, da sprudelt uns entgegen der Trank der Verj\u00fcngung. Das lie\u00df sich das trockne, d\u00fcrre Volk nicht zweimal sagen; besonders die armen Dursth\u00e4lse, die im m\u00e4rkischen Sande sa\u00dfen, wollten wieder bl\u00fchend und jugendlich werden, und sie st\u00fcrzten nach jenen Wunderquellen, und das soff und schl\u00fcrfte und schl\u00fcckerte mit \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfiger Gier. Aber es erging ihnen wie der alten Kammerjungfer, von welcher man folgendes erz\u00e4hlt: Sie hatte bemerkt, da\u00df ihre Dame ein Wunderelexier besa\u00df, das die Jugend wiederherstellt; in Abwesenheit der Dame nahm sie nun aus deren Toilette das Fl\u00e4schchen, welches jenes Elexier enthielt, statt aber nur einige Tropfen zu trinken, tat sie einen so gro\u00dfen, langen Schluck, da\u00df sie durch die h\u00f6chstgesteigerte Wunderkraft des verj\u00fcngenden Tranks nicht blo\u00df wieder jung, sondern gar zu einem ganz kleinen Kinde wurde. Wahrlich, so ging es namentlich unserem vortrefflichen Herrn Tieck, einem der besten Dichter der Schule; er hatte von den Volksb\u00fcchern und Gedichten des Mittelalters so viel eingeschluckt, da\u00df er fast wieder ein Kind wurde und zu jener lallenden Einfalt herabbl\u00fchte, die Frau v. Sta\u00ebl so sehr viele M\u00fche hatte zu bewundern. Sie gesteht selber, da\u00df es ihr kurios vorkomme, wenn eine Person in einem Drama mit einem Monolog deb\u00fctiert, welcher mit den Worten anf\u00e4ngt: \u00bbIch bin der wackere Bonifacius, und ich komme, euch zu sagen\u00ab usw.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herr Ludwig Tieck hat durch seinen Roman \u00bbSternbalds Wanderungen\u00ab und durch die von ihm herausgegebenen und von einem gewissen Wackenroder geschriebenen \u00bbHerzensergie\u00dfungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders\u00ab auch den bildenden K\u00fcnstlern die naiven rohen Anf\u00e4nge der Kunst als Muster dargestellt. Die Fr\u00f6mmigkeit und Kindlichkeit dieser Werke, die sich eben in ihrer technischen Unbeholfenheit kundgibt, wurde zur Nachahmung empfohlen. Von Raffael wollte man nichts mehr wissen, kaum einmal von seinem Lehrer Perugino, den man freilich schon h\u00f6her sch\u00e4tzte, und in welchem man noch Reste jener Vortrefflichkeiten entdeckte, deren ganze F\u00fclle man in den unsterblichen Meisterwerken des Fra Giovanni Angelico da Fiesole so andachtsvoll bewunderte. Will man sich hier einen Begriff von dem Geschmacke der damaligen Kunstenthusiasten machen, so mu\u00df man nach dem Louvre gehen, wo noch die besten Gem\u00e4lde jener Meister h\u00e4ngen, die man damals unbedingt verehrte; und will man sich einen Begriff von dem gro\u00dfen Haufen der Poeten machen, die damals in allen m\u00f6glichen Versarten die Dichtungen des Mittelalters nachahmten, so mu\u00df man nach dem Narrenhaus zu Charenton gehn.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aber ich glaube, jene Bilder im ersten Saale des Louvre sind noch immer viel zu grazi\u00f6se, als da\u00df man sich dadurch einen Begriff von dem damaligen Kunstgeschmack machen k\u00f6nnte. Man mu\u00df sich diese altitalienischen Bilder noch obendrein ins Altdeutsche \u00fcbersetzt denken. Denn man erachtete die Werke der altdeutschen Maler f\u00fcr noch weit einf\u00e4ltiger und kindlicher und also nachahmungsw\u00fcrdiger als die altitalienischen. Denn die Deutschen verm\u00f6gen ja, hie\u00df es, mit ihrem Gem\u00fct (ein Wort, wof\u00fcr die franz\u00f6sische Sprache keinen Ausdruck hat) das Christentum tiefer aufzufassen als andere Nationen, und Friedrich Schlegel und sein Freund Herr Joseph G\u00f6rres w\u00fchlten in den alten St\u00e4dten am Rhein nach den Resten altdeutscher Gem\u00e4lde und Bildwerke, die man, gleich heiligen Reliquien, blindgl\u00e4ubig verehrte. Ich habe eben den deutschen Parna\u00df jener Zeit mit Charenton verglichen. Ich glaube aber, auch hier habe ich viel zu wenig gesagt. Ein franz\u00f6sischer Wahnsinn ist noch lange nicht so wahnsinnig wie ein deutscher; denn in diesem, wie Polonius sagen w\u00fcrde, ist Methode. Mit einer Pedanterie ohnegleichen, mit einer entsetzlichen Gewissenhaftigkeit, mit einer Gr\u00fcndlichkeit, wovon sich ein oberfl\u00e4chlicher franz\u00f6sischer Narr nicht einmal einen Begriff machen kann, trieb man jene deutsche Tollheit. Der politische Zustand Deutschlands war der christlich-altdeutschen Richtung noch besonders g\u00fcnstig. \u00bbNot lehrt beten\u00ab, sagt das Spr\u00fcchwort, und wahrlich, nie war die Not in Deutschland gr\u00f6\u00dfer und daher das Volk dem Beten, der Religion, dem Christentum zug\u00e4nglicher als damals. Kein Volk hegt mehr Anh\u00e4nglichkeit f\u00fcr seine F\u00fcrsten wie das deutsche, und mehr noch als der traurige Zustand, worin das Land durch den Krieg und die Fremdherrschaft geraten, war es der jammervolle Anblick ihrer besiegten F\u00fcrsten, die sie zu den F\u00fc\u00dfen Napoleons kriechen sahen, was die Deutschen aufs unleidlichste betr\u00fcbte; das ganze Volk glich jenen treuherzigen alten Dienern in gro\u00dfen H\u00e4usern, die alle Dem\u00fctigungen, welche ihre gn\u00e4dige Herrschaft erdulden mu\u00df, noch tiefer empfinden als diese selbst, und die im verborgenen ihre kummervollsten Tr\u00e4nen weinen, wenn etwa das herrschaftliche Silberzeug verkauft werden soll, und die sogar ihre \u00e4rmlichen Ersparnisse heimlich dazu verwenden, da\u00df nicht b\u00fcrgerliche Talglichter statt adliger Wachskerzen auf die herrschaftliche Tafel gesetzt werden, wie wir solches mit hinl\u00e4nglicher R\u00fchrung in den alten Schauspielen sehen. Die allgemeine Betr\u00fcbnis fand Trost in der Religion, und es entstand ein pietistisches Hingeben in den Willen Gottes, von welchem allein die H\u00fclfe erwartet wurde. Und in der Tat, gegen den Napoleon konnte auch gar kein anderer helfen als der liebe Gott selbst. Auf die weltlichen Heerscharen war nicht mehr zu rechnen, und man mu\u00dfte vertrauensvoll den Blick nach dem Himmel wenden. Wir h\u00e4tten auch den Napoleon ganz ruhig ertragen. Aber unsere F\u00fcrsten, w\u00e4hrend sie hofften, durch Gott von ihm befreit zu werden, gaben sie auch zugleich dem Gedanken Raum, da\u00df die zusammengefa\u00dften Kr\u00e4fte ihrer V\u00f6lker dabei sehr mitwirksam sein m\u00f6chten: man suchte in dieser Absicht den Gemeinsinn unter den Deutschen zu wecken, und sogar die allerh\u00f6chsten Personen sprachen jetzt von deutscher Volkst\u00fcmlichkeit, vom gemeinsamen deutschen Vaterlande, von der Vereinigung der christlich germanischen St\u00e4mme, von der Einheit Deutschlands. Man befahl uns den Patriotismus, und wir wurden Patrioten; denn wir tun alles, was uns unsere F\u00fcrsten befehlen. Man mu\u00df sich aber unter diesem Patriotismus nicht dasselbe Gef\u00fchl denken, das hier in Frankreich diesen Namen f\u00fchrt. Der Patriotismus der Franzosen besteht darin, da\u00df sein Herz erw\u00e4rmt wird, durch diese W\u00e4rme sich ausdehnt, sich erweitert, da\u00df es nicht mehr blo\u00df die n\u00e4chsten Angeh\u00f6rigen, sondern ganz Frankreich, das ganze Land der Zivilisation, mit seiner Liebe umfa\u00dft; der Patriotismus des Deutschen hingegen besteht darin, da\u00df sein Herz enger wird, da\u00df es sich zusammenzieht wie Leder in der K\u00e4lte, da\u00df er das Fremdl\u00e4ndische ha\u00dft, da\u00df er nicht mehr Weltb\u00fcrger, nicht mehr Europ\u00e4er, sondern nur ein enger Deutscher sein will. Da sahen wir nun das idealische Flegeltum, das Herr Jahn in System gebracht; es begann die sch\u00e4bige, plumpe, ungewaschene Opposition gegen eine Gesinnung, die eben das Herrlichste und Heiligste ist, was Deutschland hervorgebracht hat, n\u00e4mlich gegen jene Humanit\u00e4t, gegen jene allgemeine Menschenverbr\u00fcderung, gegen jenen Kosmopolitismus, dem unsere gro\u00dfen Geister, Lessing, Herder, Schiller, Goethe, Jean Paul, dem alle Gebildeten in Deutschland immer gehuldigt haben. Was sich bald darauf in Deutschland ereignete, ist euch allzuwohl bekannt. Als Gott, der Schnee und die Kosaken die besten Kr\u00e4fte des Napoleon zerst\u00f6rt hatten, erhielten wir Deutsche den allerh\u00f6chsten Befehl, uns vom fremden Joche zu befreien, und wir loderten auf in m\u00e4nnlichem Zorn ob der allzulang ertragenen Knechtschaft, und wir begeisterten uns durch die guten Melodien und schlechten Verse der K\u00f6rnerschen Lieder, und wir erk\u00e4mpften die Freiheit; denn wir tun alles, was uns von unseren F\u00fcrsten befohlen wird.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In der Periode, wo dieser Kampf vorbereitet wurde, mu\u00dfte eine Schule, die dem franz\u00f6sischen Wesen feindlich gesinnt war und alles deutsch Volkst\u00fcmliche in Kunst und Leben hervorr\u00fchmte, ihr treffliches Gedeihen finden. Die romantische Schule ging damals Hand in Hand mit dem Streben der Regierungen und der geheimen Gesellschaften, und Herr A. W. Schlegel konspirierte gegen Racine zu demselben Ziel, wie der Minister Stein gegen Napoleon konspirierte. Die Schule schwamm mit dem Strom der Zeit, n\u00e4mlich mit dem Strom, der nach seiner Quelle zur\u00fcckstr\u00f6mte. Als endlich der deutsche Patriotismus und die deutsche Nationalit\u00e4t vollst\u00e4ndig siegte, triumphierte auch definitiv die volkst\u00fcmlich-germanisch-christlich-romantische Schule, die \u00bbneudeutsch-religi\u00f6s-patriotische Kunst\u00ab. Napoleon, der gro\u00dfe Klassiker, der so klassisch wie Alexander und C\u00e4sar, st\u00fcrzte zu Boden, und die Herren August Wilhelm und Friedrich Schlegel, die kleinen Romantiker, die ebenso romantisch wie das D\u00e4umchen und der gestiefelte Kater, erhoben sich als Sieger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aber auch hier blieb jene Reaktion nicht aus, welche jeder \u00dcbertreibung auf dem Fu\u00dfe folgt. Wie das spiritualistische Christentum eine Reaktion gegen die brutale Herrschaft des imperial r\u00f6mischen Materialismus war; wie die erneuerte Liebe zur heiter griechischen Kunst und Wissenschaft als eine Reaktion gegen den bis zur bl\u00f6dsinnigsten Abt\u00f6tung ausgearteten christlichen Spiritualismus zu betrachten ist; wie die Wiedererweckung der mittelalterlichen Romantik ebenfalls f\u00fcr eine Reaktion gegen die n\u00fcchterne Nachahmerei der antiken klassischen Kunst gelten kann: so sehen wir jetzt auch eine Reaktion gegen die Wiedereinf\u00fchrung jener katholisch-feudalistischen Denkweise, jenes Rittertums und Pfaffentums, das in Bild und Wort gepredigt worden und unter h\u00f6chst befremdlichen Umst\u00e4nden. Als n\u00e4mlich die alten K\u00fcnstler des Mittelalters, die empfohlenen Muster, so hoch gepriesen und bewundert standen, hatte man ihre Vortrefflichkeit nur dadurch zu erkl\u00e4ren gewu\u00dft, da\u00df diese M\u00e4nner an das Thema glaubten, welches sie darstellten, da\u00df sie in ihrer kunstlosen Einfalt mehr leisten konnten als die sp\u00e4teren glaubenlosen Meister, die es im Technischen viel weiter gebracht, da\u00df der Glauben in ihnen Wunder getan; \u2013 und in der Tat, wie konnte man die Herrlichkeiten eines Fra Angelico da Fiesole oder das Gedicht des Bruder Ottfried anders erkl\u00e4ren! Die K\u00fcnstler allnun, die es mit der Kunst ernsthaft meinten und die gottvolle Schiefheit jener Wundergem\u00e4lde und die heilige Unbeholfenheit jener Wundergedichte, kurz das unerkl\u00e4rbar Mystische der alten Werke nachahmen wollten: diese entschlossen sich, zu derselben Hippokrene zu wandern, wo auch die alten Meister ihre mirakul\u00f6se Begeisterung gesch\u00f6pft; sie pilgerten nach Rom, wo der Statthalter Christi mit der Milch seiner Eselin die schwinds\u00fcchtige deutsche Kunst wieder st\u00e4rken sollte; mit einem Worte, sie begaben sich in den Scho\u00df der alleinseligmachenden r\u00f6misch-katholisch-apostolischen Kirche. Bei mehreren Anh\u00e4ngern der romantischen Schule bedurfte es keines formellen \u00dcbergangs, sie waren Katholiken von Geburt, z. B. Herr G\u00f6rres und Herr Clemens Brentano, und sie entsagten nur ihren bisherigen freigeistigen Ansichten. Andere aber waren im Scho\u00dfe der protestantischen Kirche geboren und erzogen, z. B. Friedrich Schlegel, Herr Ludwig Tieck, Novalis, Werner, Sch\u00fctz, Carove, Adam M\u00fcller usw., und ihr \u00dcbertritt zum Katholizismus bedurfte eines \u00f6ffentlichen Akts. Ich habe hier nur Schriftsteller erw\u00e4hnt; die Zahl der Maler, die scharenweise das evangelische Glaubensbekenntnis und die Vernunft abschworen, war weit gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Wenn man nun sah, wie diese jungen Leute vor der r\u00f6misch-katholischen Kirche gleichsam Queue machten und sich in den  alten Geisteskerker wieder hineindr\u00e4ngten, aus welchem ihre V\u00e4ter sich mit so vieler Kraft befreit hatten, da sch\u00fcttelte man in Deutschland sehr bedenklich den Kopf. Als man aber entdeckte, da\u00df eine Propaganda von Pfaffen und Junkern, die sich gegen die religi\u00f6se und politische Freiheit Europas verschworen, die Hand im Spiele hatte, da\u00df es eigentlich der Jesuitismus war, welcher mit den s\u00fc\u00dfen T\u00f6nen der Romantik die deutsche Jugend so verderblich zu verlocken wu\u00dfte wie einst der fabelhafte Rattenf\u00e4nger die Kinder von Hameln: da entstand gro\u00dfer Unmut und auflodernder Zorn unter den Freunden der Geistesfreiheit und des Protestantismus in Deutschland.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ich habe Geistesfreiheit und Protestantismus zusammen genannt; ich hoffe aber, da\u00df man mich, obgleich ich mich in Deutschland zur protestantischen Kirche bekenne, keiner Parteilichkeit f\u00fcr letztere beschuldigen wird. Wahrlich, ohne alle Parteilichkeit habe ich Geistesfreiheit und Protestantismus zusammen genannt; und in der Tat, es besteht in Deutschland ein freundschaftliches Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen beiden. Auf jeden Fall sind sie beide verwandt und zwar wie Mutter und Tochter. Wenn man auch der protestantischen Kirche manche fatale Engsinnigkeit vorwirft, so mu\u00df man doch zu ihrem unsterblichen Ruhme bekennen: indem durch sie die freie Forschung in der christlichen Religion erlaubt und die Geister vom Joche der Autorit\u00e4t befreit wurden, hat die freie Forschung \u00fcberhaupt in Deutschland Wurzel schlagen und die Wissenschaft sich selbst\u00e4ndig entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. Die deutsche Philosophie, obgleich sie sich jetzt neben die protestantische Kirche stellt, ja sich \u00fcber sie heben will, ist doch immer nur ihre Tochter; als solche ist sie immer in betreff der Mutter zu einer schonenden Piet\u00e4t verpflichtet, und die Verwandtschaftsinteressen verlangten es, da\u00df sie sich verb\u00fcndeten, als sie beide von der gemeinschaftlichen Feindin, von dem Jesuitismus, bedroht waren. Alle Freunde der Gedankenfreiheit und der protestantischen Kirche, Skeptiker wie Orthodoxe, erhoben sich zu gleicher Zeit gegen die Restauratoren des Katholizismus; und wie sich von selbst versteht, die Liberalen, welche nicht eigentlich f\u00fcr die Interessen der Philosophie oder der protestantischen Kirche, sondern f\u00fcr die Interessen der b\u00fcrgerlichen Freiheit besorgt waren, traten ebenfalls zu dieser Opposition. Aber in Deutschland waren die Liberalen bis jetzt auch immer zugleich Schulphilosophen und Theologen, und es ist immer dieselbe Idee der Freiheit, wof\u00fcr sie k\u00e4mpfen, sie m\u00f6gen nun ein rein politisches oder ein philosophisches oder ein theologisches Thema behandeln. Dieses zeigt sich am offenbarsten in dem Leben des Mannes, der die romantische Schule in Deutschland schon bei ihrer Entstehung untergraben und jetzt am meisten dazu beigetragen hat, sie zu st\u00fcrzen. Es ist Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dieser Mann ist in Frankreich gar nicht bekannt, und doch gibt es wenige, denen das deutsche Volk in Hinsicht seiner geistigen Ausbildung mehr verdankt als eben ihm. Er ist vielleicht nach Lessing der gr\u00f6\u00dfte B\u00fcrger in der deutschen Literatur. Jedenfalls war er ein gro\u00dfer Mann, und er verdient, da\u00df ich nicht allzuk\u00e4rglichen Wortes ihn bespreche.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die Biographie des Mannes ist fast die aller deutschen Schriftsteller der alten Schule. Er wurde geboren im Jahre 1751 im Mecklenburgischen von armen Eltern, studierte Theologie, vernachl\u00e4ssigte sie, als er die Poesie und die Griechen kennenlernte, besch\u00e4ftigte sich ernsthaft mit diesen beiden, gab Unterricht, um nicht zu verhungern, wurde Schulmeister zu Otterndorf im Lande Hadeln, \u00fcbersetzte die Alten und lebte arm, frugal und arbeitsam bis in sein f\u00fcnfundsiebzigstes Jahr. Er hatte einen ausgezeichneten Namen unter den Dichtern der alten Schule; aber die neuen romantischen Poeten zupften best\u00e4ndig an seinem Lorbeer und sp\u00f6ttelten viel \u00fcber den altmodischen, ehrlichen Vo\u00df, der in treuherziger, manchmal sogar plattdeutscher Sprache das kleinb\u00fcrgerliche Leben an der Niederelbe besungen, der keine mittelalterlichen Ritter und Madonnen, sondern einen schlichten protestantischen Pfarrer und seine tugendhafte Familie zu Helden seiner Dichtungen w\u00e4hlte, und der so kerngesund und b\u00fcrgerlich und nat\u00fcrlich war, w\u00e4hrend sie, die neuen Troubadouren, so somnambulisch kr\u00e4nklich, so ritterlich vornehm und so genial unnat\u00fcrlich waren. Dem Friedrich Schlegel, dem berauschten S\u00e4nger der liederlich romantischen \u00bbLucinde\u00ab, wie fatal mu\u00dfte er ihm sein, dieser n\u00fcchterne Vo\u00df mit seiner keuschen \u00bbLuise\u00ab und seinem alten, ehrw\u00fcrdigen \u00bbPfarrer von Gr\u00fcnau\u00ab! Herr August Wilhelm Schlegel, der es mit der Liederlichkeit und dem Katholizismus nie so ehrlich gemeint hat wie sein Bruder, der konnte schon mit dem alten Vo\u00df viel besser harmonieren, und es bestand zwischen beiden eigentlich nur eine \u00dcbersetzer-Rivalit\u00e4t, die \u00fcbrigens f\u00fcr die deutsche Sprache von gro\u00dfem Nutzen war. Vo\u00df hatte schon vor Entstehung der neuen Schule den Homer \u00fcbersetzt, jetzt \u00fcbersetzte er mit unerh\u00f6rtem Flei\u00df auch die \u00fcbrigen heidnischen Dichter des Altertums, w\u00e4hrend Herr A.W. Schlegel die christlichen Dichter der romantisch katholischen Zeit \u00fcbersetzte. Beider Arbeiten wurden bestimmt durch die versteckt polemische Absicht: Vo\u00df wollte die klassische Poesie und Denkweise durch seine \u00dcbersetzungen bef\u00f6rdern, w\u00e4hrend Herr A.W. Schlegel die christlich-romantischen Dichter in guten \u00dcbersetzungen dem Publikum zur Nachahmung und Bildung zug\u00e4nglich machen wollte. Ja, der Antagonismus zeigte sich sogar in den Sprachformen beider \u00dcbersetzer. W\u00e4hrend Herr Schlegel immer s\u00fc\u00dflicher und zimperlicher seine Worte gl\u00e4ttete, wurde Vo\u00df in seinen \u00dcbersetzungen immer herber und derber, die sp\u00e4teren sind durch die hineingefeilten Rauheiten fast unaussprechbar, so da\u00df, wenn man auf dem blank polierten, schl\u00fcpfrigen Mahagoni-Parkett der Schlegelschen Verse leicht ausglitschte, so stolperte man ebenso leicht \u00fcber die verifizierten Marmorbl\u00f6cke des alten Vo\u00df. Endlich, aus Rivalit\u00e4t, wollte letzterer auch den Shakespeare \u00fcbersetzen, welchen Herr Schlegel in seiner ersten Periode so vortrefflich ins Deutsche \u00fcbertragen; aber das bekam dem alten Vo\u00df sehr schlecht und seinem Verleger noch schlimmer; die \u00dcbersetzung mi\u00dflang ganz und gar. Wo Herr Schlegel vielleicht zu weich \u00fcbersetzt, wo seine Verse manchmal wie geschlagene Sahne sind, wobei man nicht wei\u00df, wenn man sie zu Munde f\u00fchrt, ob man sie essen oder trinken soll: da ist Vo\u00df hart wie Stein, und man mu\u00df f\u00fcrchten, sich die Kinnlade zu zerbrechen, wenn man seine Verse ausspricht. Aber was eben den Vo\u00df so gewaltig auszeichnete, das ist die Kraft, womit er gegen alle Schwierigkeiten k\u00e4mpfte; und er k\u00e4mpfte nicht blo\u00df mit der deutschen Sprache, sondern auch mit jenem jesuitisch-aristokratischen Unget\u00fcm, das damals aus dem Walddunkel der deutschen Literatur sein mi\u00dfgestaltetes Haupt hervorreckte, und Vo\u00df schlug ihm eine t\u00fcchtige Wunde.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herr Wolfgang Menzel, ein deutscher Schriftsteller, welcher als einer der bittersten Gegner von Vo\u00df bekannt ist, nennt ihn einen nieders\u00e4chsischen Bauern. Trotz der schm\u00e4henden Absicht ist doch diese Benennung sehr treffend. In der Tat, Vo\u00df ist ein nieders\u00e4chsischer Bauer, so wie Luther es war; es fehlte ihm alles Chevalereske, alle Courtoisie, alle Grazi\u00f6sit\u00e4t; er geh\u00f6rte ganz zu jenem derb-kr\u00e4ftigen, starkm\u00e4nnlichen Volksstamme, dem das Christentum mit Feuer und Schwert gepredigt werden mu\u00dfte, der sich erst nach drei verlorenen Schlachten dieser Religion unterwarf, der aber immer noch in seinen Sitten und Weisen viel nordisch heidnische Starrheit behalten und in seinen materiellen und geistigen K\u00e4mpfen so tapfer und hartn\u00e4ckig sich zeigt wie seine alten G\u00f6tter. Ja, wenn ich mir den Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df in seiner Polemik und in seinem ganzen Wesen betrachte, so ist mir, als s\u00e4he ich den alten, ein\u00e4ugigen Odin selbst, der seine Asenburg verlassen, um Schulmeister zu werden zu Otterndorf im Lande Hadeln, und der da den blonden Holsteinern die lateinischen Deklinationen und den christlichen Katechismus einstudiert, und der in seinen Nebenstunden die griechischen Dichter ins Deutsche \u00fcbersetzt und von Thor den Hammer borgt, um die Verse damit zurechtzuklopfen, und der endlich, des m\u00fchsamen Gesch\u00e4ftes \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig, den armen Fritz Stolberg mit dem Hammer auf den Kopf schl\u00e4gt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Das war eine famose Geschichte. Friedrich, Graf von Stolberg, war ein Dichter der alten Schule und au\u00dferordentlich ber\u00fchmt in Deutschland, vielleicht minder durch seine poetische Talente als durch den Grafentitel, der damals in der deutschen Literatur viel mehr galt als jetzt. Aber Fritz Stolberg war ein liberaler Mann von edlem Herzen, und er war ein Freund jener b\u00fcrgerlichen J\u00fcnglinge, die in G\u00f6ttingen eine poetische Schule stifteten. Ich empfehle den franz\u00f6sischen Literaten, die Vorrede zu den Gedichten von H\u00f6lty zu lesen, worin Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df das idyllische Zusammenleben des Dichterbundes geschildert, wozu er und Fritz Stolberg geh\u00f6rten. Diese beiden waren endlich allein \u00fcbriggeblieben von jener jugendlichen Dichterschar. Als nun Fritz Stolberg mit Eklat zur katholischen Kirche \u00fcberging und Vernunft und Freiheitsliebe abschwor und ein Bef\u00f6rderer des Obskurantismus wurde und durch sein vornehmes Beispiel gar viele Schw\u00e4chlinge nachlockte: da trat Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df, der alte, siebzigj\u00e4hrige Mann, dem ebenso alten Jugendfreunde \u00f6ffentlich entgegen und schrieb das B\u00fcchlein: \u00bbWie ward Fritz Stolberg ein Unfreier?\u00ab Er analysierte darin dessen ganzes Leben und zeigte: wie die aristokratische Natur in dem verbr\u00fcderten Grafen immer lauernd verborgen lag; wie sie nach den Ereignissen der Franz\u00f6sischen Revolution immer sichtbarer hervortrat; wie Stolberg sich der sogenannten Adelskette, die den franz\u00f6sischen Freiheitsprinzipien entgegenwirken wollte, heimlich anschlo\u00df; wie diese Adligen sich mit den Jesuiten verbanden; wie man durch die Wiederherstellung des Katholizismus auch die Adelsinteressen zu f\u00f6rdern glaubte; wie \u00fcberhaupt die Restauration des christkatholischen feudalistischen Mittelalters und der Untergang der protestantischen Denkfreiheit und des politischen B\u00fcrgertums betrieben wurden. Die deutsche Demokratie und die deutsche Aristokratie, die sich vor den Revolutionszeiten, als jene noch nichts hoffte und diese nichts bef\u00fcrchtete, so unbefangen jugendlich verbr\u00fcdert hatten, diese standen sich jetzt als Greise gegen\u00fcber und k\u00e4mpften den Todeskampf.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Der Teil des deutschen Publikums, der die Bedeutung und die entsetzliche Notwendigkeit dieses Kampfes nicht begriffen, tadelte den armen Vo\u00df \u00fcber die unbarmherzige Enth\u00fcllung von h\u00e4uslichen Verh\u00e4ltnissen, von kleinen Lebensereignissen, die aber in ihrer Zusammenstellung ein beweisendes Ganzes bildeten. Da gab es nun auch sogenannte vornehme Seelen, die mit aller Erhabenheit \u00fcber engherzige Kleinigkeitskr\u00e4merei schrien und den armen Vo\u00df der Klatschsucht bez\u00fcchtigten. Andere, Spie\u00dfb\u00fcrger, die besorgt waren, man m\u00f6chte von ihrer eigenen Misere auch einmal die Gardine fortziehen, diese eiferten \u00fcber die Verletzung des literarischen Herkommens, wonach alle Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten, alle Enth\u00fcllungen des Privatlebens streng verboten seien. Als nun Fritz Stolberg in derselben Zeit starb und man diesen Sterbefall dem Kummer zuschrieb und gar nach seinem Tode das \u00bbLiebesb\u00fcchlein\u00ab herauskam, worin er mit fr\u00f6mmelnd christlichem, verzeihendem, echt jesuitischem Ton \u00fcber den armen verblendeten Freund sich aussprach: da flossen die Tr\u00e4nen des deutschen Mitleids, da weinte der deutsche Michel seine dicksten Tropfen, und es sammelte sich viel weichherzige Wut gegen den armen Vo\u00df, und die meisten Scheltworte erhielt er von ebendenselben Menschen, f\u00fcr deren geistiges und weltliches Heil er gestritten.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00dcberhaupt kann man in Deutschland auf das Mitleid und die Tr\u00e4nendr\u00fcsen der gro\u00dfen Menge rechnen, wenn man in einer Polemik t\u00fcchtig mi\u00dfhandelt wird. Die Deutschen gleichen dann jenen alten Weibern, die nie vers\u00e4umen, einer Exekution zuzusehen, die sich da als die neugierigsten Zuschauer vorandr\u00e4ngen, beim Anblick des armen S\u00fcnders und seiner Leiden aufs bitterste jammern und ihn sogar verteidigen. Diese Klageweiber, die bei literarischen Exekutionen so jammervoll sich geb\u00e4rden, w\u00fcrden aber sehr verdrie\u00dflich sein, wenn der arme S\u00fcnder, dessen Auspeitschung sie eben erwarteten, pl\u00f6tzlich begnadigt w\u00fcrde und sie sich, ohne etwas gesehen zu haben, wieder nach Hause trollen m\u00fc\u00dften. Ihr vergr\u00f6\u00dferter Zorn trifft dann denjenigen, der sie in ihren Erwartungen get\u00e4uscht hat. Indessen die Vossische Polemik wirkte m\u00e4chtig auf das Publikum, und sie zerst\u00f6rte in der \u00f6ffentlichen Meinung die grassierende Vorliebe f\u00fcr das Mittelalter. Jene Polemik hatte Deutschland aufgeregt, ein gro\u00dfer Teil des Publikums erkl\u00e4rte sich unbedingt f\u00fcr Vo\u00df, ein gr\u00f6\u00dferer Teil erkl\u00e4rte sich nur f\u00fcr dessen Sache. Es erfolgten Schriften und Gegenschriften, und die letzten Lebenstage des alten Mannes wurden durch diese H\u00e4ndel nicht wenig verbittert. Er hatte es mit den schlimmsten Gegnern zu tun, mit den Pfaffen, die ihn unter allen Vermummungen angriffen. Nicht blo\u00df die Kryptokatholiken, sondern auch die Pietisten, die Quietisten, die lutherischen Mystiker; kurz alle jene supernaturalistischen Sekten der protestantischen Kirche, die untereinander so sehr verschiedene Meinungen hegen, vereinigten sich doch mit gleich gro\u00dfem Ha\u00df gegen Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df, den Rationalisten. Mit diesem Namen bezeichnet man in Deutschland diejenigen Leute, die der Vernunft auch in der Religion ihre Rechte einr\u00e4umen, im Gegensatz zu den Supernaturalisten, welche sich da mehr oder minder jeder Vernunfterkenntnis ent\u00e4u\u00dfert haben. Letztere, in ihrem Hasse gegen die armen Rationalisten, sind wie die Narren eines Narrenhauses, die, wenn sie auch von den entgegengesetztesten Narrheiten befangen sind, dennoch sich einigerma\u00dfen leidlich untereinander vertragen, aber mit der grimmigsten Erbitterung gegen denjenigen Mann erf\u00fcllt sind, den sie als ihren gemeinschaftlichen Feind betrachten, und der eben kein anderer ist als der Irrenarzt, der ihnen die Vernunft wiedergeben will.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wurde nun die romantische Schule durch die Enth\u00fcllung der katholischen Umtriebe in der \u00f6ffentlichen Meinung zugrunde gerichtet, so erlitt sie gleichzeitig in ihrem eigenen Tempel einen vernichtenden Einspruch, und zwar aus dem Munde eines jener G\u00f6tter, die sie selbst dort aufgestellt. N\u00e4mlich Wolfgang Goethe trat von seinem Postamente herab und sprach das Verdammnisurteil \u00fcber die Herren Schlegel, \u00fcber dieselben Oberpriester, die ihn mit so viel Weihrauch umduftet. Diese Stimme vernichtete den ganzen Spuk; die Gespenster des Mittelalters entflohen; die Eulen verkrochen sich wieder in die obskuren Burgtr\u00fcmmer; die Raben flatterten wieder nach ihren alten Kircht\u00fcrmen; Friedrich Schlegel ging nach Wien, wo er t\u00e4glich Messe h\u00f6rte und gebratene H\u00e4hndel a\u00df; Herr August Wilhelm Schlegel zog sich zur\u00fcck in die Pagode des Brahma.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offen gestanden, Goethe hat damals eine sehr zweideutige Rolle gespielt, und man kann ihn nicht unbedingt loben. Es ist wahr, die Herren Schlegel haben es nie ehrlich mit ihm gemeint; vielleicht nur, weil sie in ihrer Polemik gegen die alte Schule auch einen lebenden Dichter als Vorbild aufstellen mu\u00dften und keinen geeigneteren fanden als Goethe, auch von diesem einigen literarischen Vorschub erwarteten, bauten sie ihm einen Altar und r\u00e4ucherten ihm und lie\u00dfen das Volk vor ihm knien. Sie hatten ihn auch so ganz in der N\u00e4he. Von Jena nach Weimar f\u00fchrt eine Allee h\u00fcbscher B\u00e4ume, worauf Pflaumen wachsen, die sehr gut schmecken, wenn man durstig ist von der Sommerhitze; und diesen Weg wanderten die Schlegel sehr oft, und in Weimar hatten sie manche Unterredung mit dem Herren Geheimerat von Goethe, der immer ein sehr gro\u00dfer Diplomat war und die Schlegel ruhig anh\u00f6rte, beif\u00e4llig l\u00e4chelte, ihnen manchmal zu essen gab, auch sonst einen Gefallen tat usw. Sie hatten sich auch an Schiller gemacht; aber dieser war ein ehrlicher Mann und wollte nichts von ihnen wissen. Der Briefwechsel zwischen ihm und Goethe, der vor drei Jahren gedruckt worden, wirft manches Licht auf das Verh\u00e4ltnis dieser beiden Dichter zu den Schlegeln. Goethe l\u00e4chelt vornehm \u00fcber sie hinweg; Schiller ist \u00e4rgerlich \u00fcber ihre impertinente Skandalsucht, \u00fcber ihre Manier, durch Skandal Aufsehen zu machen, und er nennt sie \u00bbLaffen\u00ab.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mochte jedoch Goethe immerhin vornehm tun, so hatte er nichtsdestoweniger den gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil seiner Renommee den Schlegeln zu verdanken. Diese haben das Studium seiner Werke eingeleitet und bef\u00f6rdert. Die schn\u00f6de, beleidigende Art, womit er diese beiden M\u00e4nner am Ende ablehnte, riecht sehr nach Undank. Vielleicht verdro\u00df es aber den tiefschauenden Goethe, da\u00df die Schlegel ihn nur als Mittel zu ihren Zwecken gebrauchen wollten; vielleicht haben ihn, den Minister eines protestantischen Staates, diese Zwecke zu kompromittieren gedroht; vielleicht war es gar der altheidnische G\u00f6tterzorn, der in ihm erwachte, als er das dumpfig katholische Treiben sah: \u2013 denn wie Vo\u00df dem starren ein\u00e4ugigen Odin glich, so glich Goethe dem gro\u00dfen Jupiter in Denkweise und Gestalt. Jener freilich mu\u00dfte mit Thors Hammer t\u00fcchtig zuschlagen; dieser brauchte nur das Haupt mit den ambrosischen Locken unwillig zu sch\u00fctteln, und die Schlegel zitterten und krochen davon. Ein \u00f6ffentliches Dokument jenes Einspruchs von Seiten Goethes erschien im zweiten Hefte der Goetheschen Zeitschrift \u00bbKunst und Altertum\u00ab, und es f\u00fchrte den Titel: \u00bb\u00dcber die christlich-patriotisch-neu-deutsche Kunst\u00ab. Mit diesem Artikel machte Goethe gleichsam seinen 18. Brumaire in der deutschen Literatur; denn indem er so barsch die Schlegel aus dem Tempel jagte und viele ihrer eifrigsten J\u00fcnger an seine eigne Person heranzog und von dem Publikum, dem das Schlegelsche Direktorium schon lange ein Greuel war, akklamiert wurde, begr\u00fcndete er seine Alleinherrschaft in der deutschen Literatur. Von jener Stunde an war von den Herren Schlegel nicht mehr die Rede; nur dann und wann sprach man noch von ihnen, wie man jetzt noch manchmal von Barras oder Gohier spricht; man sprach nicht mehr von Romantik und klassischer Poesie, sondern von Goethe und wieder von Goethe. Freilich es traten unterdessen einige Dichter auf den Schauplatz, die an Kraft und Phantasie diesem nicht viel nachgaben; aber sie erkannten ihn aus Courtoisie als ihr Oberhaupt, sie umgaben ihn huldigend, sie k\u00fc\u00dften ihm die Hand, sie knieten vor ihm; diese Granden des Parnassus unterschieden sich jedoch von der gro\u00dfen Menge dadurch, da\u00df sie auch in Goethes Gegenwart ihren Lorbeerkranz auf dem Haupte behalten durften. Manchmal auch frondierten sie ihn; sie \u00e4rgerten sich aber dann, wenn irgendein Geringerer sich ebenfalls berechtigt hielt, Goethen zu schelten. Die Aristokraten, wenn sie auch noch so b\u00f6se gegen ihren Souver\u00e4n gestimmt sind, werden doch verdrie\u00dflich, wenn sich auch der Plebs gegen diesen erhebt. Und die geistigen Aristokraten in Deutschland hatten w\u00e4hrend der beiden letzten Dezennien sehr gerechte Gr\u00fcnde, auf Goethe ungehalten zu sein. Wie ich selber es damals mit hinl\u00e4nglicher Bitterkeit offen gesagt habe: Goethe glich jenem Ludwig XI., der den hohen Adel unterdr\u00fcckte und den tiers \u00e9tat emporhob.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Das war widerw\u00e4rtig. Goethe hatte Angst vor jedem selbst\u00e4ndigen Originalschriftsteller und lob und pries alle unbedeutende Kleingeister; ja er trieb dieses so weit, da\u00df es endlich f\u00fcr ein Brevet der Mittelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit galt, von Goethe gelobt worden zu sein.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sp\u00e4terhin spreche ich von den neuen Dichtern, die w\u00e4hrend der Goetheschen Kaiserzeit hervortraten. Das ist ein junger Wald, dessen St\u00e4mme erst jetzt ihre Gr\u00f6\u00dfe zeigen, seitdem die hundertj\u00e4hrige Eiche gefallen ist, von deren Zweigen sie so weit \u00fcberragt und \u00fcberschattet wurden.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Es fehlte, wie schon gesagt, nicht an einer Opposition, die gegen Goethe, diesen gro\u00dfen Baum, mit Erbitterung eiferte. Menschen von den entgegengesetztesten Meinungen vereinigten sich zu solcher Opposition. Die Altgl\u00e4ubigen, die Orthodoxen, \u00e4rgerten sich, da\u00df in dem Stamme des gro\u00dfen Baumes keine Nische mit einem Heiligenbildchen befindlich war, ja, da\u00df sogar die nackten Dryaden des Heidentums darin ihr Hexenwesen trieben, und sie h\u00e4tten gern mit geweihter Axt, gleich dem heiligen Bonifazius, diese alte Zaubereiche niedergef\u00e4llt; die Neugl\u00e4ubigen, die Bekenner des Liberalismus, \u00e4rgerten sich im Gegenteil, da\u00df man diesen Baum nicht zu einem Freiheitsbaum und am allerwenigsten zu einer Barrikade benutzen konnte. In der Tat, der Baum war zu hoch, man konnte nicht auf seinen Wipfel eine rote M\u00fctze stecken und darunter die Carmagnole tanzen. Das gro\u00dfe Publikum aber verehrte diesen Baum, eben weil er so selbst\u00e4ndig herrlich war, weil er so lieblich die ganze Welt mit seinem Wohlduft erf\u00fcllte, weil seine Zweige so prachtvoll bis in den Himmel ragten, so da\u00df es aussah, als seien die Sterne nur die goldnen Fr\u00fcchte des gro\u00dfen Wunderbaums.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die Opposition gegen Goethe beginnt eigentlich mit dem Erscheinen der sogenannten falschen Wanderjahre, welche unter dem Titel \u00bbWilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre\u00ab im Jahre 1821, also bald nach dem Untergang der Schlegel, bei Gottfried Basse in Quedlinburg herauskamen. Goethe hatte n\u00e4mlich unter ebendiesem Titel eine Fortsetzung von \u00bbWilhelm Meisters Lehrjahren\u00ab angek\u00fcndigt, und sonderbarerweise erschien diese Fortsetzung gleichzeitig mit jenem literarischen Doppelg\u00e4nger, worin nicht blo\u00df die Goethesche Schreibart nachgeahmt war, sondern auch der Held des Goetheschen Originalromans sich als handelnde Person darstellte. Diese Nach\u00e4ffung zeugte nicht sowohl von vielem Geiste als vielmehr von gro\u00dfem Takte, und da der Verfasser einige Zeit seine Anonymit\u00e4t zu bewahren wu\u00dfte und man ihn vergebens zu erraten suchte, so ward das Interesse des Publikums noch k\u00fcnstlich gesteigert. Es ergab sich jedoch am Ende, da\u00df der Verfasser ein bisher unbekannter Landprediger war, namens \u00bbPustkuchen\u00ab, was auf franz\u00f6sisch omelette souffl\u00e9e hei\u00dft, ein Name, welcher auch sein ganzes Wesen bezeichnete. Es war nichts anders als der alte pietistische Sauerteig, der sich \u00e4sthetisch aufgeblasen hatte. Es ward dem Goethe in jenem Buche vorgeworfen: da\u00df seine Dichtungen keinen moralischen Zweck h\u00e4tten; da\u00df er keine edlen Gestalten, sondern nur vulg\u00e4re Figuren schaffen k\u00f6nne; da\u00df hingegen Schiller die idealisch edelsten Charaktere aufgestellt und daher ein gr\u00f6\u00dferer Dichter sei.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Letzteres, da\u00df n\u00e4mlich Schiller gr\u00f6\u00dfer sei als Goethe, war der besondere Streitpunkt, den jenes Buch hervorgerufen. Man verfiel in die Manie, die Produkte beider Dichter zu vergleichen, und die Meinungen teilten sich. Die Schillerianer pochten auf die sittliche Herrlichkeit eines Max Piccolomini, einer Thekla, eines Marquis Posa und sonstiger Schillerschen Theaterhelden, wogegen sie die Goetheschen Personen, eine Philine, ein K\u00e4thchen, ein Kl\u00e4rchen und dergleichen h\u00fcbsche Kreaturen, f\u00fcr unmoralische Weibsbilder erkl\u00e4rten. Die Goetheaner bemerkten l\u00e4chelnd, da\u00df letztere und auch die Goetheschen Helden schwerlich als moralisch zu vertreten w\u00e4ren, da\u00df aber die Bef\u00f6rderung der Moral, die man von Goethes Dichtungen verlange, keineswegs der Zweck der Kunst sei: denn in der Kunst g\u00e4be es keine Zwecke, wie in dem Weltbau selbst, wo nur der Mensch die Begriffe \u00bbZweck und Mittel\u00ab hineingegr\u00fcbelt: die Kunst, wie die Welt, sei ihrer selbst willen da, und wie die Welt ewig dieselbe bleibt, wenn auch in ihrer Beurteilung die Ansichten der Menschen unaufh\u00f6rlich wechseln, so m\u00fcsse auch die Kunst von den zeitlichen Ansichten der Menschen unabh\u00e4ngig bleiben; die Kunst m\u00fc\u00dfte daher besonders unabh\u00e4ngig bleiben von der Moral, welche auf der Erde immer wechselt, sooft eine neue Religion emporsteigt und die alte Religion verdr\u00e4ngt. In der Tat, da jedesmal nach Abflu\u00df einer Reihe Jahrhunderte immer eine neue Religion in der Welt aufkommt und, indem sie in die Sitten \u00fcbergeht, sich auch als eine neue Moral geltend macht: so w\u00fcrde jede Zeit die Kunstwerke der Vergangenheit als unmoralisch verketzern, wenn solche nach dem Ma\u00dfstabe der zeitigen Moral beurteilt werden sollen. Wie wir es auch wirklich erlebt, haben gute Christen, welche das Fleisch als teuflisch verdammen, immer ein \u00c4rgernis empfunden beim Anblick der griechischen G\u00f6tterbilder; keusche M\u00f6nche haben der antiken Venus eine Sch\u00fcrze vorgebunden; sogar bis in die neuesten Zeiten hat man den nackten Statuen ein l\u00e4cherliches Feigenblatt angeklebt; ein frommer Qu\u00e4ker hat sein ganzes Verm\u00f6gen aufgeopfert, um die sch\u00f6nsten mythologischen Gem\u00e4lde des Giulio Romano anzukaufen und zu verbrennen \u2013 wahrlich, er verdiente daf\u00fcr in den Himmel zu kommen und dort t\u00e4glich mit Ruten gepeitscht zu werden! Eine Religion, welche etwa Gott nur in die Materie setzte und daher nur das Fleisch f\u00fcr g\u00f6ttlich hielte, m\u00fc\u00dfte, wenn sie in die Sitten \u00fcberginge, eine Moral hervorbringen, wonach nur diejenigen Kunstwerke preisenswert, die das Fleisch verherrlichen, und wonach im Gegenteil die christlichen Kunstwerke, die nur die Nichtigkeit des Fleisches darstellen, als unmoralisch zu verwerfen w\u00e4ren. Ja, die Kunstwerke, die in dem einen Lande moralisch, werden in einem anderen Lande, wo eine andere Religion in die Sitten \u00fcbergegangen, als unmoralisch betrachtet werden k\u00f6nnen, z. B. unsere bildenden K\u00fcnste erregen den Abscheu eines strenggl\u00e4ubigen Moslem, und dagegen manche K\u00fcnste, die in den Haremen des Morgenlands f\u00fcr h\u00f6chst unschuldig gelten, sind dem Christen ein Greuel. Da in Indien der Stand einer Bajadere durchaus nicht durch die Sitte fletriert ist, so gilt dort das Drama \u00bbVasantasena\u00ab, dessen Heldin ein feiles Freudenm\u00e4dchen, durchaus nicht f\u00fcr unmoralisch; wagte man es aber einmal, dieses St\u00fcck im Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais aufzuf\u00fchren, so w\u00fcrde das ganze Parterre \u00fcber Immoralit\u00e4t schreien, dasselbe Parterre, welches t\u00e4glich mit Vergn\u00fcgen die Intrigenst\u00fccke betrachtet, deren Heldinnen junge Witwen sind, die am Ende lustig heuraten, statt sich, wie die indische Moral es verlangt, mit ihren verstorbenen Gatten zu verbrennen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indem die Goetheaner von solcher Ansicht ausgehen, betrachten sie die Kunst als eine unabh\u00e4ngige zweite Welt, die sie so hoch stellen, da\u00df alles Treiben der Menschen, ihre Religion und ihre Moral, wechselnd und wandelbar unter ihr hin sich bewegt. Ich kann aber dieser Ansicht nicht unbedingt huldigen; die Goetheaner lie\u00dfen sich dadurch verleiten, die Kunst selbst als das H\u00f6chste zu proklamieren und von den Anspr\u00fcchen jener ersten wirklichen Welt, welcher doch der Vorrang geb\u00fchrt, sich abzuwenden.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schiller hat sich jener ersten Welt viel bestimmter angeschlossen als Goethe, und wir m\u00fcssen ihn in dieser Hinsicht loben. Ihn, den Friedrich Schiller, erfa\u00dfte lebendig der Geist seiner Zeit, er rang mit ihm, er ward von ihm bezwungen, er folgte ihm zum Kampfe, er trug sein Banner, und es war dasselbe Banner, worunter man auch jenseits des Rheines so enthusiastisch stritt, und wof\u00fcr wir noch immer bereit sind, unser bestes Blut zu vergie\u00dfen. Schiller schrieb f\u00fcr die gro\u00dfen Ideen der Revolution, er zerst\u00f6rte die geistigen Bastillen, er baute an dem Tempel der Freiheit und zwar an jenem ganz gro\u00dfen Tempel, der alle Nationen gleich einer einzigen Br\u00fcdergemeinde umschlie\u00dfen soll; er war Kosmopolit. Er begann mit jenem Ha\u00df gegen die Vergangenheit, welchen wir in den \u00bbR\u00e4ubern\u00ab sehen, wo er einem kleinen Titanen gleicht, der aus der Schule gelaufen ist und Schnaps getrunken hat und dem Jupiter die Fenster einwirft; er endigte mit jener Liebe f\u00fcr die Zukunft, die schon im \u00bbDon Karlos\u00ab wie ein Blumenwald hervorbl\u00fcht, und er selber ist jener Marquis Posa, der zugleich Prophet und Soldat ist, der auch f\u00fcr das k\u00e4mpft, was er prophezeit, und unter dem spanischen Mantel das sch\u00f6nste Herz tr\u00e4gt, das jemals in Deutschland geliebt und gelitten hat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Der Poet, der kleine Nachsch\u00f6pfer, gleicht dem lieben Gott auch darin, da\u00df er seine Menschen nach dem eigenen Bilde erschafft. Wenn daher Karl Moor und der Marquis Posa ganz Schiller selbst sind, so gleicht Goethe seinem Werther, seinem Wilhelm Meister und seinem Faust, worin man die Phasen seines Geistes studieren kann. Wenn Schiller sich ganz in die Geschichte st\u00fcrzt, sich f\u00fcr die gesellschaftlichen Fortschritte der Menschheit enthusiasmiert und die Weltgeschichte besingt: so versenkt sich Goethe mehr in die individuellen Gef\u00fchle, oder in die Kunst, oder in die Natur. Goethe, den Pantheisten, mu\u00dfte die Naturgeschichte endlich als ein Hauptstudium besch\u00e4ftigen, und nicht blo\u00df in Dichtungen, sondern auch in wissenschaftlichen Werken gab er uns die Resultate seiner Forschungen. Sein Indifferentismus war ebenfalls ein Resultat seiner pantheistischen Weltansicht.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Es ist leider wahr, wir m\u00fcssen es eingestehn, nicht selten hat der Pantheismus die Menschen zu Indifferentisten gemacht. Sie dachten: wenn alles Gott ist, so mag es gleichg\u00fcltig sein, womit man sich besch\u00e4ftigt, ob mit Wolken oder mit antiken Gemmen, ob mit Volksliedern oder mit Affenknochen, ob mit Menschen oder mit Kom\u00f6dianten. Aber da ist eben der Irrtum: Alles ist nicht Gott, sondern Gott ist alles; Gott manifestiert sich nicht in gleichem Ma\u00dfe in allen Dingen, er manifestiert sich vielmehr nach verschiedenen Graden in den verschiedenen Dingen, und jedes tr\u00e4gt in sich den Drang, einen h\u00f6heren Grad der G\u00f6ttlichkeit zu erlangen; und das ist das gro\u00dfe Gesetz des Fortschrittes in der Natur. Die Erkenntnis dieses Gesetzes, das am tiefsinnigsten von den Saint-Simonisten offenbart worden, macht jetzt den Pantheismus zu einer Weltansicht, die durchaus nicht zum Indifferentismus f\u00fchrt, sondern zum aufopferungss\u00fcchtigsten Fortstreben. Nein, Gott manifestiert sich nicht gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig in allen Dingen, wie Wolfgang Goethe glaubte, der dadurch ein Indifferentist wurde und, statt mit den h\u00f6chsten Menschheitsinteressen, sich nur mit Kunstspielsachen, Anatomie, Farbenlehre, Pflanzenkunde und Wolkenbeobachtungen besch\u00e4ftigte: Gott manifestiert sich in den Dingen mehr oder minder, er lebt in dieser best\u00e4ndigen Manifestation, Gott ist in der Bewegung, in der Handlung, in der Zeit, sein heiliger Odem weht durch die Bl\u00e4tter der Geschichte, letztere ist das eigentliche Buch Gottes; und das f\u00fchlte und ahnte Friedrich Schiller, und er ward ein \u00bbr\u00fcckw\u00e4rtsgekehrter Prophet\u00ab, und er schrieb den \u00bbAbfall der Niederlande\u00ab, den \u00bbDrei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrigen Krieg\u00ab und die \u00bbJungfrau von Orleans\u00ab und den \u00bbTell\u00ab.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Freilich, auch Goethe besang einige gro\u00dfe Emanzipationsgeschichten, aber er besang sie als Artist. Da er n\u00e4mlich den christlichen Enthusiasmus, der ihm fatal war, verdrie\u00dflich ablehnte und den philosophischen Enthusiasmus unserer Zeit nicht begriff oder nicht begreifen wollte, weil er dadurch aus seiner Gem\u00fctsruhe herausgerissen zu werden f\u00fcrchtete: so behandelte er den Enthusiasmus \u00fcberhaupt ganz historisch, als etwas Gegebenes, als einen Stoff, der behandelt werden soll, der Geist wurde Materie unter seinen H\u00e4nden, und er gab ihm die sch\u00f6ne, gef\u00e4llige Form. So wurde er der gr\u00f6\u00dfte K\u00fcnstler in unserer Literatur, und alles, was er schrieb, wurde ein abgerundetes Kunstwerk.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Das Beispiel des Meisters leitete die J\u00fcnger, und in Deutschland entstand dadurch jene literarische Periode, die ich einst als \u00bbdie Kunstperiode\u00ab bezeichnet, und wobei ich den nachteiligen Einflu\u00df auf die politische Entwickelung des deutschen Volkes nachgewiesen habe. Keineswegs jedoch leugnete ich bei dieser Gelegenheit den selbst\u00e4ndigen Wert der Goetheschen Meisterwerke. Sie zieren unser teueres Vaterland, wie sch\u00f6ne Statuen einen Garten zieren, aber es sind Statuen. Man kann sich darin verlieben, aber sie sind unfruchtbar: die Goetheschen Dichtungen bringen nicht die Tat hervor wie die Schillerschen. Die Tat ist das Kind des Wortes, und die Goetheschen sch\u00f6nen Worte sind kinderlos. Das ist der Fluch alles dessen, was blo\u00df durch die Kunst entstanden ist. Die Statue, die der Pygmalion verfertigt, war ein sch\u00f6nes Weib, sogar der Meister verliebte sich darin, sie wurde lebendig unter seinen K\u00fcssen, aber soviel wir wissen, hat sie nie Kinder bekommen. Ich glaube, Herr Charles Nodier hat mal in solcher Beziehung etwas \u00c4hnliches gesagt, und das kam mir gestern in den Sinn, als ich, die unteren S\u00e4le des Louvre durchwandernd, die alten G\u00f6tterstatuen betrachtete. Da standen sie mit den stummen wei\u00dfen Augen, in dem marmornen L\u00e4cheln eine geheime Melancholie, eine tr\u00fcbe Erinnerung vielleicht an \u00c4gypten, das Totenland, dem sie entsprossen, oder leidende Sehnsucht nach dem Leben, woraus sie jetzt durch andere Gottheiten fortgedr\u00e4ngt sind, oder auch Schmerz \u00fcber ihre tote Unsterblichkeit: \u2013 sie schienen des Wortes zu harren, das sie wieder dem Leben zur\u00fcckg\u00e4be, das sie aus ihrer kalten, starren Regungslosigkeit erl\u00f6se. Sonderbar! diese Antiken mahnten mich an die Goetheschen Dichtungen, die ebenso vollendet, ebenso herrlich, ebenso ruhig sind und ebenfalls mit Wehmut zu f\u00fchlen scheinen, da\u00df ihre Starrheit und K\u00e4lte sie von unserem jetzigen bewegt warmen Leben abscheidet, da\u00df sie nicht mit uns leiden und jauchzen k\u00f6nnen, da\u00df sie keine Menschen sind, sondern ungl\u00fcckliche Mischlinge von Gottheit und Stein.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diese wenigen Andeutungen erkl\u00e4ren nun den Groll der verschiedenen Parteien, die in Deutschland gegen Goethe laut geworden. Die Orthodoxen waren ungehalten gegen den gro\u00dfen Heiden, wie man Goethe allgemein in Deutschland nennt; sie f\u00fcrchteten seinen Einflu\u00df auf das Volk, dem er []() durch l\u00e4chelnde Dichtungen, ja durch die unscheinbarsten Liederchen seine Weltansicht einfl\u00f6\u00dfte; sie sahen in ihm den gef\u00e4hrlichsten Feind des Kreuzes, das ihm, wie er sagte, so fatal war wie Wanzen, Knoblauch und Tabak; n\u00e4mlich so ungef\u00e4hr lautet die Xenie, die Goethe auszusprechen wagte mitten in Deutschland, im Lande, wo jenes Ungeziefer, der Knoblauch, der Tabak und das Kreuz, in heiliger Allianz \u00fcberall herrschend sind. Just dieses war es jedoch keineswegs, was uns, den M\u00e4nnern der Bewegung, an Goethe mi\u00dffiel. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, wir tadelten die Unfruchtbarkeit seines Wortes, das Kunstwesen, das durch ihn in Deutschland verbreitet wurde, das einen quietisierenden Einflu\u00df auf die deutsche Jugend aus\u00fcbte, das einer politischen Regeneration unseres Vaterlandes entgegenwirkte. Der indifferente Pantheist wurde daher von den entgegengesetztesten Seiten angegriffen; um franz\u00f6sisch zu sprechen, die \u00e4u\u00dferste Rechte und die \u00e4u\u00dferste Linke verbanden sich gegen ihn; und w\u00e4hrend der schwarze Pfaffe mit dem Kruzifix gegen ihn losschlug, rannte gegen ihn zu gleicher Zeit der w\u00fctende Sansculotte mit der Pike. Herr Wolfgang Menzel, der den Kampf gegen Goethe mit einem Aufwand von Esprit gef\u00fchrt hat, der eines besseren Zweckes wert war, zeigte in seiner Polemik nicht so einseitig den spiritualistischen Christen oder den unzufriedenen Patrioten: er basierte vielmehr einen Teil seiner Angriffe auf die letzten Ausspr\u00fcche Friedrich Schlegels, der nach seinem Fall, aus der Tiefe seines katholischen Doms, sein Wehe \u00fcber Goethe ausgerufen, \u00fcber den Goethe, \u00bbdessen Poesie keinen Mittelpunkt habe\u00ab. Herr Menzel ging noch weiter und zeigte, da\u00df Goethe kein Genie sei, sondern nur ein Talent, er r\u00fchmte Schiller als Gegensatz usw. Das geschah einige Zeit vor der Juliusrevolution, Herr Menzel war damals der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Verehrer des Mittelalters, sowohl in Hinsicht der Kunstwerke als der Institutionen desselben, er schm\u00e4hte mit unaufh\u00f6rlichem Ingrimm den Johann Heinrich Vo\u00df, pries mit unerh\u00f6rter Begeisterung den Herrn Joseph G\u00f6rres: sein Ha\u00df gegen Goethe war daher echt, und er schrieb gegen ihn aus \u00dcberzeugung, also nicht, wie viele meinten, um sich dadurch bekannt zu machen. Obgleich ich selber damals ein Gegner Goethes war, so war ich doch unzufrieden \u00fcber die Herbheit, womit Herr Menzel ihn kritisierte, und ich beklagte diesen Mangel an Piet\u00e4t. Ich bemerkte: Goethe sei doch immer der K\u00f6nig unserer Literatur; wenn man an einen solchen das kritische Messer lege, m\u00fcsse man es nie an der geb\u00fchrenden Courtoisie fehlen lassen, gleich dem Scharfrichter, welcher Karl I. zu k\u00f6pfen hatte und, ehe er sein Amt verrichtete, vor dem K\u00f6nige niederkniete und seine allerh\u00f6chste Verzeihung erbat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unter den Gegnern Goethes geh\u00f6rte auch der famose Hofrat M\u00fcllner und sein einzig treu gebliebener Freund, der Herr Professor Sch\u00fctz, Sohn des alten Sch\u00fctz. Noch einige andere, die minder famose Namen f\u00fchrten, z.B. ein Herr Spaun, der lange Zeit wegen politischer Vergehen im Zuchthause gesessen hat, geh\u00f6rten zu den \u00f6ffentlichen Gegnern Goethes. Unter uns gesagt, es war eine sehr gemischte Gesellschaft. Was vorgebracht wurde, habe ich hinl\u00e4nglich angedeutet; schwerer ist es, das besondere Motiv zu erraten, das jeden einzelnen bewogen haben mag, seine antigoetheanischen \u00dcberzeugungen \u00f6ffentlich auszusprechen. Nur von einer Person kenne ich dieses Motiv ganz genau, und da ich dieses selber bin, so will ich jetzt ehrlich gestehen: es war der Neid. Zu meinem Lobe mu\u00df ich jedoch nochmals erw\u00e4hnen, da\u00df ich in Goethe nie den Dichter angegriffen, sondern nur den Menschen. Ich habe nie seine Werke getadelt. Ich habe nie M\u00e4ngel darin sehen k\u00f6nnen wie jene Kritiker, die mit ihren feingeschliffenen Augengl\u00e4sern auch die Flecken im Monde bemerkt haben; die scharfsichtigen Leute! was sie f\u00fcr Flecken ansehen, das sind bl\u00fchende W\u00e4lder, silberne Str\u00f6me, erhabene Berge, lachende T\u00e4ler.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nichts ist t\u00f6richter als die Geringsch\u00e4tzung Goethes zugunsten des Schiller, mit welchem man es keineswegs ehrlich meinte, und den man von jeher pries, um Goethe herabzusetzen. Oder wu\u00dfte man wirklich nicht, da\u00df jene hochger\u00fchmten hochidealischen Gestalten, jene Altarbilder der Tugend und Sittlichkeit, die Schiller aufgestellt, weit leichter zu verfertigen waren als jene s\u00fcndhaften, klein weltlichen, befleckten Wesen, die uns Goethe in seinen Werken erblicken l\u00e4\u00dft? Wissen sie denn nicht, da\u00df mittelm\u00e4\u00dfige Maler meistens lebensgro\u00dfe Heiligenbilder auf die Leinwand pinseln, da\u00df aber schon ein gro\u00dfer Meister dazu geh\u00f6rt, um etwa einen spanischen Betteljungen, der sich laust, einen niederl\u00e4ndischen Bauern, welcher kotzt, oder dem ein Zahn ausgezogen wird, und h\u00e4\u00dfliche alte Weiber, wie wir sie auf kleinen holl\u00e4ndischen Kabinettbildchen sehen, lebenswahr und technisch vollendet zu malen? Das Gro\u00dfe und Furchtbare l\u00e4\u00dft sich in der Kunst weit leichter darstellen als das Kleine und Putzige. Die \u00e4gyptischen Zauberer haben dem Moses viele Kunstst\u00fccke nachmachen k\u00f6nnen, z.B. die Schlangen, das Blut, sogar die Fr\u00f6sche; aber als er scheinbar weit leichtere Zauberdinge, n\u00e4mlich Ungeziefer, hervorbrachte, da gestanden sie ihre Ohnmacht, und sie konnten das kleine Ungeziefer nicht nachmachen, und sie sagten: da ist der Finger Gottes. Scheltet immerhin \u00fcber die Gemeinheiten im \u00bbFaust\u00ab, \u00fcber die Szenen auf dem Brocken, im Auerbachskeller, scheltet auf die Liederlichkeiten im \u00bbMeister\u00ab \u2013 das k\u00f6nnt ihr dennoch alles nicht nachmachen; da ist der Finger Goethes! Aber ihr wollt das auch nicht nachmachen, und ich h\u00f6re, wie ihr mit Abscheu behauptet: wir sind keine Hexenmeister, wir sind gute Christen. Da\u00df ihr keine Hexenmeister seid, das wei\u00df ich.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goethes gr\u00f6\u00dftes Verdienst ist eben die Vollendung alles dessen, was er darstellt; da gibt es keine Partien, die stark sind, w\u00e4hrend andere schwach, da ist kein Teil ausgemalt, w\u00e4hrend der andere nur skizziert worden, da gibt es keine Verlegenheiten, kein herk\u00f6mmliches F\u00fcllwerk, keine Vorliebe f\u00fcr Einzelheiten. Jede Person in seinen Romanen und Dramen behandelt er, wo sie vork\u00f6mmt, als w\u00e4re sie die Hauptperson. So ist es auch bei Homer, so bei Shakespeare. In den Werken aller gro\u00dfen Dichter gibt es eigentlich gar keine Nebenpersonen, jede Figur ist Hauptperson an ihrer Stelle. Solche Dichter gleichen den absoluten F\u00fcrsten, die den Menschen keinen selbst\u00e4ndigen Wert beimessen, sondern ihnen selber nach eigenem Gutd\u00fcnken ihre h\u00f6chste Geltung zuerkennen. Als ein franz\u00f6sischer Gesandter einst gegen den Kaiser Paul von Ru\u00dfland erw\u00e4hnte, da\u00df ein wichtiger Mann seines Reiches sich f\u00fcr irgendeine Sache interessiere, da fiel ihm der Kaiser streng in die Rede mit den merkw\u00fcrdigen Worten: \u00bbEs gibt in diesem Reiche keinen wichtigen Mann au\u00dfer demjenigen, mit welchem Ich eben spreche, und nur solange Ich mit ihm spreche, ist er wichtig.\u00ab Ein absoluter Dichter, der ebenfalls seine Macht von Gottes Gnade erhalten hat, betrachtet in gleicher Weise diejenige Person seines Geisterreichs als die wichtigste, die er eben sprechen l\u00e4\u00dft, die eben unter seine Feder geraten, und aus solchem Kunstdespotismus entsteht jene wunderbare Vollendung der kleinsten Figuren in den Werken Homers, Shakespeares und Goethes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wenn ich etwas herbe von den Gegnern Goethes gesprochen habe, so d\u00fcrfte ich noch viel Herberes von seinen Apologisten sagen. Die meisten derselben haben in ihrem Eifer noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Torheiten vorgebracht. Auf der Grenze des L\u00e4cherlichen steht in dieser Hinsicht einer, namens Herr Eckermann, dem es \u00fcbrigens nicht an Geist fehlt. In dem Kampfe gegen Herrn Pustkuchen hat Karl Immermann, der jetzt unser gr\u00f6\u00dfter dramatischer Dichter ist, seine kritischen Sporen erworben; er hat da ein vortreffliches Schriftchen zu Tage gef\u00f6rdert. Zumeist haben sich die Berliner bei dieser Gelegenheit ausgezeichnet. Der bedeutendste K\u00e4mpe f\u00fcr Goethe war zu jeder Zeit Varnhagen von Ense, ein Mann, der Gedanken im Herzen tr\u00e4gt, die so gro\u00df sind wie die Welt, und sie in Worten ausspricht, die so kostbar und zierlich sind wie geschnittene Gemmen. Es ist jener vornehme Geist, auf dessen Urteil Goethe immer das meiste Gewicht gelegt hat. \u2013 Vielleicht ist es n\u00fctzlich, hier zu erw\u00e4hnen, da\u00df Herr Wilhelm von Humboldt bereits fr\u00fcher ein ausgezeichnetes Buch \u00fcber Goethe geschrieben hat. Seit den letzten zehn Jahren brachte jede Leipziger Messe mehrere Schriften \u00fcber Goethe hervor. Die Untersuchungen des Herrn Schubart \u00fcber Goethe geh\u00f6ren zu den Merkw\u00fcrdigkeiten der hohen Kritik. Was Herr H\u00e4ring, der unter dem Namen Willibald Alexis schreibt, in verschiedenen Zeitschriften \u00fcber Goethe gesagt hat, war ebenso bedeutend wie geistreich. Herr Zimmermann, Professor zu Hamburg, hat in seinen m\u00fcndlichen Vortr\u00e4gen die vortrefflichsten Urteile \u00fcber Goethe ausgesprochen, die man zwar sp\u00e4rlich, aber desto tiefsinniger in seinen dramaturgischen Bl\u00e4ttern angedeutet findet. Auf verschiedenen deutschen Universit\u00e4ten wurde ein Kollegium \u00fcber Goethe gelesen, und von allen seinen Werken war es vorz\u00fcglich der \u00bbFaust\u00ab, womit sich das Publikum besch\u00e4ftigte. Er wurde vielfach fortgesetzt und kommentiert, er ward die weltliche Bibel der Deutschen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ich w\u00e4re kein Deutscher, wenn ich bei Erw\u00e4hnung des \u00bbFaustes\u00ab nicht einige erkl\u00e4rende Gedanken dar\u00fcber ausspr\u00e4che. Denn vom gr\u00f6\u00dften Denker bis zum kleinsten Marqueur, vom Philosophen bis herab zum Doktor der Philosophie \u00fcbt jeder seinen Scharfsinn an diesem Buche. Aber es ist wirklich ebenso weit wie die Bibel, und wie diese umfa\u00dft es Himmel und Erde mitsamt dem Menschen und seiner Exegese. Der Stoff ist hier wieder der Hauptgrund, weshalb der \u00bbFaust\u00ab so popul\u00e4r ist; da\u00df er jedoch diesen Stoff herausgesucht aus den Volkssagen, das zeugt eben von Goethes unbewu\u00dftem Tiefsinn, von seinem Genie, das immer das N\u00e4chste und Rechte zu ergreifen wu\u00dfte. Ich darf den Inhalt des \u00bbFaust\u00ab als bekannt voraussetzen; denn das Buch ist in der letzten Zeit auch in Frankreich ber\u00fchmt geworden. Aber ich wei\u00df nicht, ob hier die alte Volkssage selbst bekannt ist, ob auch hierzulande auf den Jahrm\u00e4rkten ein graues, flie\u00dfpapiernes, schlechtgedrucktes und mit derben Holzschnitten verziertes Buch verkauft wird, worin umst\u00e4ndlich zu lesen ist: wie der Erzzauberer Johannes Faustus, ein gelehrter Doktor, der alle Wissenschaften studiert hatte, am Ende seine B\u00fccher wegwarf und ein B\u00fcndnis mit dem Teufel schlo\u00df, wodurch er alle sinnlichen Freuden der Erde genie\u00dfen konnte, aber auch seine Seele dem h\u00f6llischen Verderben hingeben mu\u00dfte. Das Volk im Mittelalter hat immer, wenn es irgendwo gro\u00dfe Geistesmacht sah, dergleichen einem Teufelsb\u00fcndnis zugeschrieben, und der Albertus Magnus, Raimund Lullus, Theophrastus Paracelsus, Agrippa von Nettesheim, auch in England der Roger Baco galten f\u00fcr Zauberer, Schwarzk\u00fcnstler, Teufelsbanner. Aber weit eigent\u00fcmlichere Dinge singt und sagt man von dem Doktor Faustus, welcher nicht blo\u00df die Erkenntnis der Dinge, sondern auch die reellsten Gen\u00fcsse vom Teufel verlangt hat, und das ist eben der Faust, der die Buchdruckerei erfunden und zur Zeit lebte, wo man anfing, gegen die strenge Kirchenautorit\u00e4t zu predigen und selbst\u00e4ndig zu forschen; \u2013 so da\u00df mit Faust die mittelalterliche Glaubensperiode aufh\u00f6rt und die moderne kritische Wissenschaftsperiode anf\u00e4ngt. Es ist in der Tat sehr bedeutsam, da\u00df zur Zeit, wo nach der Volksmeinung der Faust gelebt hat, eben die Reformation beginnt, und da\u00df er selber die Kunst erfunden haben soll, die dem Wissen einen Sieg \u00fcber den Glauben verschafft, n\u00e4mlich die Buchdruckerei, eine Kunst, die uns aber auch die katholische Gem\u00fctsruhe geraubt und uns in Zweifel und Revolutionen gest\u00fcrzt \u2013 ein anderer als ich w\u00fcrde sagen, endlich in die Gewalt des Teufels geliefert hat. Aber nein, das Wissen, die Erkenntnis der Dinge durch die Vernunft, die Wissenschaft, gibt uns endlich die Gen\u00fcsse, um die uns der Glaube, das katholische Christentum, so lange geprellt hat; wir erkennen, da\u00df die Menschen nicht blo\u00df zu einer himmlischen, sondern auch zu einer irdischen Gleichheit berufen sind; die politische Br\u00fcderschaft, die uns von der Philosophie gepredigt wird, ist uns wohlt\u00e4tiger als die rein geistige Br\u00fcderschaft, wozu uns das Christentum verholfen; und das Wissen wird Wort, und das Wort wird Tat, und wir k\u00f6nnen noch bei Lebzeiten auf dieser Erde selig werden; \u2013 wenn wir dann noch obendrein der himmlischen Seligkeit, die uns das Christentum so bestimmt verspricht, nach dem Tode teilhaftig werden, so soll uns das sehr lieb sein.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Das hat nun l\u00e4ngst schon das deutsche Volk tiefsinnig geahnt: denn das deutsche Volk ist selber jener gelehrte Doktor Faust, es ist selber jener Spiritualist, der mit dem Geiste endlich die Ungen\u00fcgbarkeit des Geistes begriffen und nach materiellen Gen\u00fcssen verlangt und dem Fleische seine Rechte wiedergibt; \u2013 doch noch befangen in der Symbolik der katholischen Poesie, wo Gott als Repr\u00e4sentant des Geistes und der Teufel als der Repr\u00e4sentant des Fleisches gilt, bezeichnete man jene Rehabilitation des Fleisches als einen Abfall von Gott, als ein B\u00fcndnis mit dem Teufel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Es wird aber noch einige Zeit dauern, ehe beim deutschen Volke in Erf\u00fcllung geht, was es so tiefsinnig in jenem Gedichte prophezeit hat, ehe es eben durch den Geist die Usurpationen des Geistes einsieht und die Rechte des Fleisches vindiziert. Das ist dann die Revolution, die gro\u00dfe Tochter der Reformation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minder bekannt als der \u00bbFaust\u00ab ist hier in Frankreich Goethes \u00bbWest-\u00f6stlicher Divan\u00ab, ein sp\u00e4teres Buch, von welchem Frau v. Sta\u00ebl noch nicht Kenntnis hatte, und dessen wir hier besonders erw\u00e4hnen m\u00fcssen. Es enth\u00e4lt die Denk- und Gef\u00fchlsweise des Orients in bl\u00fchenden Liedern und kernigen Spr\u00fcchen; und das duftet und gl\u00fcht darin wie ein Harem voll verliebter Odalisken mit schwarzen geschminkten Gasellenaugen und sehns\u00fcchtig wei\u00dfen Armen. Es ist dem Leser dabei so schauerlich l\u00fcstern zumute wie dem gl\u00fccklichen Caspar Debureau, als er in Konstantinopel oben auf der Leiter stand und de haut en bas dasjenige sah, was der Beherrscher der Gl\u00e4ubigen nur de bas en haut zu sehen pflegt. Manchmal ist dem Leser auch zumute, als l\u00e4ge er behaglich ausgestreckt auf einem persischen Teppich und rauche aus einer langr\u00f6hrigen Wasserpfeife den gelben Tabak von Turkistan, w\u00e4hrend eine schwarze Sklavin ihm mit einem bunten Pfauenwedel K\u00fchlung zuweht und ein sch\u00f6ner Knabe ihm eine Schale mit echtem Mokka-Kaffee darreicht: \u2013 den berauschendsten Lebensgenu\u00df hat hier Goethe in Verse gebracht, und diese sind so leicht, so gl\u00fccklich, so hingehaucht, so \u00e4therisch, da\u00df man sich wundert, wie dergleichen in deutscher Sprache m\u00f6glich war. Dabei gibt er auch in Prosa die allersch\u00f6nsten Erkl\u00e4rungen \u00fcber Sitten und Treiben im Morgenlande, \u00fcber das patriarchalische Leben der Araber; und da ist Goethe immer ruhig l\u00e4chelnd und harmlos wie ein Kind und weisheitsvoll wie ein Greis. Diese Prosa ist so durchsichtig wie das gr\u00fcne Meer, wenn heller Sommernachmittag und Windstille und man ganz klar hinabschauen kann in die Tiefe, wo die versunkenen St\u00e4dte mit ihren verschollenen Herrlichkeiten sichtbar werden; \u2013 manchmal ist aber auch jene Prosa so magisch, so ahnungsvoll wie der Himmel, wenn die Abendd\u00e4mmerung heraufgezogen, und die gro\u00dfen Goetheschen Gedanken treten dann hervor, rein und golden wie die Sterne. Unbeschreiblich ist der Zauber dieses Buches; es ist ein Selam, den der Okzident dem Oriente geschickt hat, und es sind gar n\u00e4rrische Blumen darunter: sinnlich rote Rosen, Hortensien wie wei\u00dfe nackte M\u00e4dchenbusen, spa\u00dfhaftes L\u00f6wenmaul, Purpurdigitalis wie lange Menschenfinger, verdrehte Krokosnasen und in der Mitte, lauschend verborgen, stille deutsche Veilchen. Dieser Selam aber bedeutet, da\u00df der Okzident seines frierend mageren Spiritualismus \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig geworden und an der gesunden K\u00f6rperwelt des Orients sich wieder erlaben m\u00f6chte. Goethe, nachdem er im \u00bbFaust\u00ab sein Mi\u00dfbehagen an dem abstrakt Geistigen und sein Verlangen nach reellen Gen\u00fcssen ausgesprochen, warf sich gleichsam mit dem Geiste selbst in die Arme des Sensualismus, indem er den \u00bbWest-\u00f6stlichen Divan\u00ab schrieb.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Es ist daher h\u00f6chst bedeutsam, da\u00df dieses Buch bald nach dem \u00bbFaust\u00ab erschien. Es war die letzte Phase Goethes, und sein Beispiel war von gro\u00dfem Einflu\u00df auf die Literatur. Unsere Lyriker besangen jetzt den Orient. \u2013 Erw\u00e4hnenswert mag es auch sein, da\u00df Goethe, indem er Persien und Arabien so freudig besang, gegen Indien den bestimmtesten Widerwillen aussprach. Ihm mi\u00dffiel an diesem Lande das Bizarre, Verworrene, Unklare, und vielleicht entstand diese Abneigung dadurch, da\u00df er bei den sanskritischen Studien der Schlegel und ihrer Herren Freunde eine katholische Hinterlist witterte. []() Diese Herren betrachteten n\u00e4mlich Hindostan als die Wiege der katholischen Weltordnung, sie sahen dort das Musterbild ihrer Hierarchie, sie fanden dort ihre Dreieinigkeit, ihre Menschwerdung, ihre Bu\u00dfe, ihre S\u00fchne, ihre Kasteiungen und alle ihre sonstigen geliebten Steckenpferde. Goethes Widerwillen gegen Indien reizte nicht wenig diese Leute, und Herr August Wilhelm Schlegel nannte ihn deshalb mit gl\u00e4sernem \u00c4rger \u00bbeinen zum Islam bekehrten Heiden\u00ab.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unter den Schriften, welche dieses Jahr \u00fcber Goethe erschienen sind, verdient ein hinterlassenes Werk von Johann Falk: \u00bbGoethe aus n\u00e4herem pers\u00f6nlichen Umgange dargestellt\u00ab, die r\u00fchmlichste Erw\u00e4hnung. Der Verfasser hat uns in diesem Buche au\u00dfer einer detaillierten Abhandlung \u00fcber den \u00bbFaust\u00ab (die nicht fehlen durfte!) die vortrefflichsten Notizen \u00fcber Goethe mitgeteilt, und er zeigte uns denselben in allen Beziehungen des Lebens ganz naturgetreu, ganz unparteiisch, mit allen seinen Tugenden und Fehlern. Hier sehen wir Goethe im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu seiner Mutter, deren Naturell sich so wunderbar im Sohne wieder abspiegelt; hier sehen wir ihn als Naturforscher, wie er eine Raupe beobachtet, die sich eingesponnen und als Schmetterling entpuppen wird; hier sehen wir ihn dem gro\u00dfen Herder gegen\u00fcber, der ernsthaft z\u00fcrnt ob dem Indifferentismus, womit Goethe die Entpuppung der Menschheit selbst unbeachtet l\u00e4\u00dft; wir sehen ihn, wie er am Hofe des Gro\u00dfherzogs von Weimar lustig improvisierend unter blonden Hofdamen sitzt, gleich dem Apoll unter den Schafen des K\u00f6nig Admetos; wir sehen ihn dann wieder, wie er mit dem Stolze eines Dalai-Lama den Kotzebue nicht anerkennen will; wie dieser, um ihn herabzusetzen, eine \u00f6ffentliche Feier zu Ehren Schillers veranstaltet; \u2013 \u00fcberall aber sehen wir ihn klug, sch\u00f6n, liebensw\u00fcrdig, eine holdselig erquickende Gestalt, \u00e4hnlich den ewigen G\u00f6ttern.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In der Tat, die \u00dcbereinstimmung der Pers\u00f6nlichkeit mit dem Genius, wie man sie bei au\u00dferordentlichen Menschen verlangt, fand man ganz bei Goethe. Seine \u00e4u\u00dfere Erscheinung war ebenso bedeutsam wie das Wort, das in seinen Schriften lebte; auch seine Gestalt war harmonisch, klar, freudig, edel gemessen, und man konnte griechische Kunst an ihm studieren wie an einer Antike. Dieser w\u00fcrdevolle Leib war nie gekr\u00fcmmt von christlicher Wurmdemut; die Z\u00fcge dieses Antlitzes waren nicht verzerrt von christlicher Zerknirschung; diese Augen waren nicht christlich s\u00fcnderhaft scheu, nicht and\u00e4chtelnd und himmelnd, nicht flimmernd bewegt: \u2013 nein, seine Augen waren ruhig wie die eines Gottes. Es ist n\u00e4mlich \u00fcberhaupt das Kennzeichen der G\u00f6tter, da\u00df ihr Blick fest ist und ihre Augen nicht unsicher hin und her zucken. Daher, wenn Agni, Waruna, Yama und Indra die Gestalt des Nala annehmen, bei Damajantis Hochzeit, da erkennt diese ihren Geliebten an dem Zwinkern seiner Augen, da, wie gesagt, die Augen der G\u00f6tter immer unbewegt sind. Letztere Eigenschaft hatten auch die Augen des Napoleon. Daher bin ich \u00fcberzeugt, da\u00df er ein Gott war. Goethes Auge blieb in seinem hohen Alter ebenso g\u00f6ttlich wie in seiner Jugend. Die Zeit hat auch sein Haupt zwar mit Schnee bedecken, aber nicht beugen k\u00f6nnen. Er trug es ebenfalls immer stolz und hoch, und wenn er sprach, wurde er immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer, und wenn er die Hand ausstreckte, so war es, als ob er mit dem Finger den Sternen am Himmel den Weg vorschreiben k\u00f6nne, den sie wandeln sollten. Um seinen Mund will man einen kalten Zug von Egoismus bemerkt haben; aber auch dieser Zug ist den ewigen G\u00f6ttern eigen, und gar dem Vater der G\u00f6tter, dem gro\u00dfen Jupiter, mit welchem ich Goethe schon oben verglichen. Wahrlich, als ich ihn in Weimar besuchte und ihm gegen\u00fcberstand, blickte ich unwillk\u00fcrlich zur Seite, ob ich nicht auch neben ihm den Adler s\u00e4he mit den Blitzen im Schnabel. Ich war nahe daran, ihn griechisch anzureden; da ich aber merkte, da\u00df er deutsch verstand, so erz\u00e4hlte ich ihm auf deutsch: da\u00df die Pflaumen auf dem Wege zwischen Jena und Weimar sehr gut schmeckten. Ich hatte in so manchen langen Wintern\u00e4chten dar\u00fcber nachgedacht, wieviel Erhabenes und Tiefsinniges ich dem Goethe sagen w\u00fcrde, wenn ich ihn mal s\u00e4he. Und als ich ihn endlich sah, sagte ich ihm, da\u00df die s\u00e4chsischen Pflaumen sehr gut schmeckten. Und Goethe l\u00e4chelte. Er l\u00e4chelte mit denselben Lippen, womit er einst die sch\u00f6ne Leda, die Europa, die Danae, die Semele und so manche andere Prinzessinnen oder auch gew\u00f6hnliche Nymphen gek\u00fc\u00dft hatte \u2013\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les dieux s'en vont. Goethe ist tot. Er starb den 22. M\u00e4rz des verflossenen Jahrs, des bedeutungsvollen Jahrs, wo unsere Erde ihre gr\u00f6\u00dften Renommeen verloren hat. Es ist, als sei der Tod in diesem Jahre pl\u00f6tzlich aristokratisch geworden, als habe er die Notabilit\u00e4ten dieser Erde besonders auszeichnen wollen, indem er sie gleichzeitig ins Grab schickte. Vielleicht gar hat er jenseits, im Schattenreich, eine Pairie stiften wollen, und in diesem Falle w\u00e4re seine fourn\u00e9e sehr gut gew\u00e4hlt. Oder hat der Tod im Gegenteil im verflossenen Jahr die Demokratie zu beg\u00fcnstigen gesucht, indem er mit den gro\u00dfen Renommeen auch ihre Autorit\u00e4ten vernichtete und die geistige Gleichheit bef\u00f6rderte? War es Respekt oder Insolenz, weshalb der Tod im vorigen Jahre die K\u00f6nige verschont hat? Aus Zerstreuung hatte er nach dem K\u00f6nig von Spanien schon die Sense erhoben, aber er besann sich zur rechten Zeit, und er lie\u00df ihn leben. In dem verflossenen Jahr ist kein einziger K\u00f6nig gestorben.

Lawrence", "The Lost Girl (Chap.14) Lyrics\n\nThe Journey Across\n\nThe train began to move. Giuseppe ran alongside, holding Ciccio's hand still; the women and children were crying and waving their handkerchiefs, the other men were shouting messages, making strange, eager gestures. And Alvina sat quite still, wonderingly. And so the big, heavy train drew out, leaving the others small and dim on the platform. It was foggy, the river was a sea of yellow beneath the ponderous iron bridge. The morning was dim and dank.\n\nThe train was very full. Next to Alvina sat a trim Frenchwoman reading L'Aiglon. There was a terrible encumbrance of packages and luggage everywhere. Opposite her sat Ciccio, his black overcoat open over his pale-grey suit, his black hat a little over his left eye. He glanced at her from time to time, smiling constrainedly. She remained very still. They ran through Bromley and out into the open country. It was grey, with shivers of grey sunshine. On the downs there was thin snow. The air in the train was hot, heavy with the crowd and tense with excitement and uneasiness. The train seemed to rush ponderously, massively, across the Weald.\n\nAnd so, through Folkestone to the sea. There was sun in the sky now, and white clouds, in the sort of hollow sky-dome above the grey earth with its horizon walls of fog. The air was still. The sea heaved with a sucking noise inside the dock. Alvina and Ciccio sat aft on the second-class deck, their bags near them. He put a white muffler round himself, Alvina hugged herself in her beaver scarf and muff. She looked tender and beautiful in her still vagueness, and Ciccio, hovering about her, was beautiful too, his estrangement gave him a certain wistful nobility which for the moment put him beyond all class inferiority. The passengers glanced at them across the magic of estrangement.\n\nThe sea was very still. The sun was fairly high in the open sky, where white cloud-tops showed against the pale, wintry blue. Across the sea came a silver sun-track. And Alvina and Ciccio looked at the sun, which stood a little to the right of the ship's course.\n\n\"The sun!\" said Ciccio, nodding towards the orb and smiling to her.\n\n\"I love it,\" she said.\n\nHe smiled again, silently. He was strangely moved: she did not know why.\n\nThe wind was cold over the wintry sea, though the sun's beams were warm. They rose, walked round the cabins. Other ships were at sea\u2014destroyers and battleships, grey, low, and sinister on the water. Then a tall bright schooner glimmered far down the channel. Some brown fishing smacks kept together. All was very still in the wintry sunshine of the Channel.\n\nSo they turned to walk to the stern of the boat. And Alvina's heart suddenly contracted. She caught Ciccio's arm, as the boat rolled gently. For there behind, behind all the sunshine, was England. England, beyond the water, rising with ash-grey, corpse-grey cliffs, and streaks of snow on the downs above. England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging. She watched it, fascinated and terrified. It seemed to repudiate the sunshine, to remain unilluminated, long and ash-grey and dead, with streaks of snow like cerements. That was England! Her thoughts flew to Woodhouse, the grey centre of it all. Home!\n\nHer heart died within her. Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off. Ciccio at her side was as nothing, as spell-bound she watched, away off, behind all the sunshine and the sea, the grey, snow-streaked substance of England slowly receding and sinking, submerging. She felt she could not believe it. It was like looking at something else. What? It was like a long, ash-grey coffin, winter, slowly submerging in the sea. England?\n\nShe turned again to the sun. But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky. The cold was beginning to soak in, moreover. She sat very still for a long time, almost an eternity. And when she looked round again there was only a bank of mist behind, beyond the sea: a bank of mist, and a few grey, stalking ships. She must watch for the coast of France.\n\nAnd there it was already, looming up grey and amorphous, patched with snow. It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light. She had imagined Boulogne gay and brilliant. Whereas it was more grey and dismal than England. But not that magical, mystic, phantom look.\n\nThe ship slowly put about, and backed into the harbour. She watched the quay approach. Ciccio was gathering up the luggage. Then came the first cry one ever hears: \"Porteur! Porteur! Want a porteur?\" A porter in a blouse strung the luggage on his strap, and Ciccio and Alvina entered the crush for the exit and the passport inspection. There was a tense, eager, frightened crowd, and officials shouting directions in French and English. Alvina found herself at last before a table where bearded men in uniforms were splashing open the big pink sheets of the English passports: she felt strange and uneasy, that her passport was unimpressive and Italian. The official scrutinized her, and asked questions of Ciccio. Nobody asked her anything\u2014she might have been Ciccio's shadow. So they went through to the vast, crowded cavern of a Customs house, where they found their porter waving to them in the mob. Ciccio fought in the mob while the porter whisked off Alvina to get seats in the big train. And at last she was planted once more in a seat, with Ciccio's place reserved beside her. And there she sat, looking across the railway lines at the harbour, in the last burst of grey sunshine. Men looked at her, officials stared at her, soldiers made remarks about her. And at last, after an eternity, Ciccio came along the platform, the porter trotting behind.\n\nThey sat and ate the food they had brought, and drank wine and tea. And after weary hours the train set off through snow-patched country to Paris. Everywhere was crowded, the train was stuffy without being warm. Next to Alvina sat a large, fat, youngish Frenchman who overflowed over her in a hot fashion. Darkness began to fall. The train was very late. There were strange and frightening delays. Strange lights appeared in the sky, everybody seemed to be listening for strange noises. It was all such a whirl and confusion that Alvina lost count, relapsed into a sort of stupidity. Gleams, flashes, noises and then at last the frenzy of Paris.\n\nIt was night, a black city, and snow falling, and no train that night across to the Gare de Lyon. In a state of semi-stupefaction after all the questionings and examinings and blusterings, they were finally allowed to go straight across Paris. But this meant another wild tussle with a Paris taxi-driver, in the filtering snow. So they were deposited in the Gare de Lyon.\n\nAnd the first person who rushed upon them was Geoffrey, in a rather grimy private's uniform. He had already seen some hard service, and had a wild, bewildered look. He kissed Ciccio and burst into tears on his shoulder, there in the great turmoil of the entrance hall of the Gare de Lyon. People looked, but nobody seemed surprised. Geoffrey sobbed, and the tears came silently down Ciccio's cheeks.\n\n\"I've waited for you since five o'clock, and I've got to go back now. Ciccio! Ciccio! I wanted so badly to see you. I shall never see thee again, brother, my brother!\" cried Gigi, and a sob shook him.\n\n\"Gigi! Mon Gigi. Tu as done regu ma lettre?\"\n\n\"Yesterday. O Ciccio, Ciccio, I shall die without thee!\"\n\n\"But no, Gigi, fr\u00e8re. You won't die.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ciccio, I shall. I know I shall.\"\n\n\"I say no, brother,\" said Ciccio. But a spasm suddenly took him, he pulled off his hat and put it over his face and sobbed into it.\n\n\"Adieu, ami! Adieu!\" cried Gigi, clutching the other man's arm. Ciccio took his hat from his tear-stained face and put it on his head. Then the two men embraced.\n\n\"Toujours \u00e0 toi!\" said Geoffrey, with a strange, solemn salute in front of Ciccio and Alvina. Then he turned on his heel and marched rapidly out of the station, his soiled soldier's overcoat flapping in the wind at the door. Ciccio watched him go. Then he turned and looked with haunted eyes into the eyes of Alvina. And then they hurried down the desolate platform in the darkness. Many people, Italians, largely, were camped waiting there, while bits of snow wavered down. Ciccio bought food and hired cushions. The train backed in. There was a horrible fight for seats, men scrambling through windows. Alvina got a place\u2014but Ciccio had to stay in the corridor.\n\nThen the long night journey through France, slow and blind. The train was now so hot that the iron plate on the floor burnt Alvina's feet. Outside she saw glimpses of snow. A fat Italian hotel-keeper put on a smoking cap, covered the light, and spread himself before Alvina. In the next carriage a child was screaming. It screamed all the night\u2014all the way from Paris to Chamb\u00e9ry it screamed. The train came to sudden halts, and stood still in the snow. The hotel-keeper snored. Alvina became almost comatose, in the burning heat of the carriage. And again the train rumbled on. And again she saw glimpses of stations, glimpses of snow, through the chinks in the curtained windows. And again there was a jerk and a sudden halt, a drowsy mutter from the sleepers, somebody uncovering the light, and somebody covering it again, somebody looking out, somebody tramping down the corridor, the child screaming.\n\nThe child belonged to two poor Italians\u2014Milanese\u2014a shred of a thin little man, and a rather loose woman. They had five tiny children, all boys: and the four who could stand on their feet all wore scarlet caps. The fifth was a baby. Alvina had seen a French official yelling at the poor shred of a young father on the platform.\n\nWhen morning came, and the bleary people pulled the curtains, it was a clear dawn, and they were in the south of France. There was no sign of snow. The landscape was half southern, half Alpine. White houses with brownish tiles stood among almond trees and cactus. It was beautiful, and Alvina felt she had known it all before, in a happier life. The morning was graceful almost as spring. She went out in the corridor to talk to Ciccio.\n\nHe was on his feet with his back to the inner window, rolling slightly to the motion of the train. His face was pale, he had that sombre, haunted, unhappy look. Alvina, thrilled by the southern country, was smiling excitedly.\n\n\"This is my first morning abroad,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n\n\"I love it here,\" she said. \"Isn't this like Italy?\"\n\nHe looked darkly out of the window, and shook his head.\n\nBut the sombre look remained on his face. She watched him. And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.\n\n\"Are you thinking of Gigi?\" she said.\n\nHe looked at her, with a faint, unhappy, bitter smile, but he said nothing. He seemed far off from her. A wild unhappiness beat inside her breast. She went down the corridor, away from him, to avoid this new agony, which after all was not her agony. She listened to the chatter of French and Italian in the corridor. She felt the excitement and terror of France, inside the railway carriage: and outside she saw white oxen slowly ploughing, beneath the lingering yellow poplars of the sub-Alps, she saw peasants looking up, she saw a woman holding a baby to her breast, watching the train, she saw the excited, yeasty crowds at the station. And they passed a river, and a great lake. And it all seemed bigger, nobler than England. She felt vaster influences spreading around, the Past was greater, more magnificent in these regions. For the first time the nostalgia of the vast Roman and classic world took possession of her. And she found it splendid. For the first time she opened her eyes on a continent, the Alpine core of a continent. And for the first time she realized what it was to escape from the smallish perfection of England, into the grander imperfection of a great continent.\n\nNear Chamb\u00e9ry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car. And secretly, she was very happy. Ciccio's distress made her uneasy. But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad. Ciccio did not trouble her very much. The sense of the bigness of the lands about her, the excitement of travelling with Continental people, the pleasantness of her coffee and rolls and honey, the feeling that vast events were taking place\u2014all this stimulated her. She had brushed, as it were, the fringe of the terror of the war and the invasion. Fear was seething around her. And yet she was excited and glad. The vast world was in one of its convulsions, and she was moving amongst it. Somewhere, she believed in the convulsion, the event elated her.\n\nThe train began to climb up to Modane. How wonderful the Alps were!\u2014what a bigness, an unbreakable power was in the mountains! Up and up the train crept, and she looked at the rocky slopes, the glistening peaks of snow in the blue heaven, the hollow valleys with fir trees and low-roofed houses. There were quarries near the railway, and men working. There was a strange mountain town, dirty-looking. And still the train climbed up and up, in the hot morning sunshine, creeping slowly round the mountain loops, so that a little brown dog from one of the cottages ran alongside the train for a long way, barking at Alvina, even running ahead of the creeping, snorting train, and barking at the people ahead. Alvina, looking out, saw the two unfamiliar engines snorting out their smoke round the bend ahead. And the morning wore away to mid-day.\n\nCiccio became excited as they neared Modane, the frontier station. His eye lit up again, he pulled himself together for the entrance into Italy. Slowly the train rolled in to the dismal station. And then a confusion indescribable, of porters and masses of luggage, the unspeakable crush and crowd at the customs barriers, the more intense crowd through the passport office, all like a madness.\n\nThey were out on the platform again, they had secured their places. Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant. They went through the passages. And there in the dirty station gang-ways and big corridors dozens of Italians were lying on the ground, men, women, children, camping with their bundles and packages in heaps. They were either emigrants or refugees. Alvina had never seen people herd about like cattle, dumb, brute cattle. It impressed her. She could not grasp that an Italian labourer would lie down just where he was tired, in the street, on a station, in any corner, like a dog.\n\nIn the afternoon they were slipping down the Alps towards Turin. And everywhere was snow\u2014deep, white, wonderful snow, beautiful and fresh, glistening in the afternoon light all down the mountain slopes, on the railway track, almost seeming to touch the train. And twilight was falling. And at the stations people crowded in once more.\n\nIt had been dark a long time when they reached Turin. Many people alighted from the train, many surged to get in. But Ciccio and Alvina had seats side by side. They were becoming tired now. But they were in Italy. Once more they went down for a meal. And then the train set off again in the night for Alessandria and Genoa, Pisa and Rome.\n\nIt was night, the train ran better, there was a more easy sense in Italy. Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions. And Alvina settled her cushion, and slept more or less till Genoa. After the long wait at Genoa she dozed off again. She woke to see the sea in the moonlight beneath her\u2014a lovely silvery sea, coming right to the carriage. The train seemed to be tripping on the edge of the Mediterranean, round bays, and between dark rocks and under castles, a night-time fairy-land, for hours. She watched spell-bound: spell-bound by the magic of the world itself. And she thought to herself: \"Whatever life may be, and whatever horror men have made of it, the world is a lovely place, a magic place, something to marvel over. The world is an amazing place.\"\n\nThis thought dozed her off again. Yet she had a consciousness of tunnels and hills and of broad marshes pallid under a moon and a coming dawn. And in the dawn there was Pisa. She watched the word hanging in the station in the dimness: \"Pisa.\" Ciccio told her people were changing for Florence. It all seemed wonderful to her\u2014wonderful. She sat and watched the black station\u2014then she heard the sound of the child's trumpet. And it did not occur to her to connect the train's moving on with the sound of the trumpet.\n\nBut she saw the golden dawn, a golden sun coming out of level country. She loved it. She loved being in Italy. She loved the lounging carelessness of the train, she liked having Italian money, hearing the Italians round her\u2014though they were neither as beautiful nor as melodious as she expected. She loved watching the glowing antique landscape. She read and read again: \"E pericoloso sporgersi,\" and \"E vietato fumare,\" and the other little magical notices on the carriages. Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them. And sympathetic Italians opposite at once asked him if they were married and who and what his bride was, and they gazed at her with bright, approving eyes, though she felt terribly bedraggled and travel-worn.\n\n\"You come from England? Yes! Nice contry!\" said a man in a corner, leaning forward to make this display of his linguistic capacity.\n\n\"Not so nice as this,\" said Alvina.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nAlvina repeated herself.\n\n\"Not so nice? Oh? No! Fog, eh!\" The fat man whisked his fingers in the air, to indicate fog in the atmosphere. \"But nice contry! Very\u2014convenient.\"\n\nHe sat up in triumph, having achieved this word. And the conversation once more became a spatter of Italian. The women were very interested. They looked at Alvina, at every atom of her. And she divined that they were wondering if she was already with child. Sure enough, they were asking Ciccio in Italian if she was \"making him a baby.\" But he shook his head and did not know, just a bit constrained. So they ate slices of sausages and bread and fried rice-balls, with wonderfully greasy fingers, and they drank red wine in big throatfuls out of bottles, and they offered their fare to Ciccio and Alvina, and were charmed when she said to Ciccio she would have some bread and sausage. He picked the strips off the sausage for her with his fingers, and made her a sandwich with a roll. The women watched her bite it, and bright-eyed and pleased they said, nodding their heads\u2014\n\n\"Buono? Buono?\"\n\nAnd she, who knew this word, understood, and replied:\n\n\"Yes, good! Buono!\" nodding her head likewise. Which caused immense satisfaction. The women showed the whole paper of sausage slices, and nodded and beamed and said:\n\n\"Se vuole ancora\u2014!\"\n\nAnd Alvina bit her wide sandwich, and smiled, and said:\n\n\"Yes, awfully nice!\"\n\nAnd the women looked at each other and said something, and Ciccio interposed, shaking his head. But one woman ostentatiously wiped a bottle mouth with a clean handkerchief, and offered the bottle to Alvina, saying:\n\n\"Vino buono. Vecchio! Vecchio!\" nodding violently and indicating that she should drink. She looked at Ciccio, and he looked back at her, doubtingly.\n\n\"Shall I drink some?\" she said.\n\n\"If you like,\" he replied, making an Italian gesture of indifference.\n\nSo she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin. She was not good at managing a bottle. But she liked the feeling of warmth it gave her. She was very tired.\n\n\"Si piace? Piace?\"\n\n\"Do you like it,\" interpreted Ciccio.\n\n\"Yes, very much. What is very much?\" she asked of Ciccio.\n\n\"Molto.\"\n\n\"Si, molto. Of course, I knew molto, from, music,\" she added.\n\nThe women made noises, and smiled and nodded, and so the train pulsed on till they came to Rome. There was again, the wild scramble with luggage, a general leave taking, and then the masses of people on the station at Rome. Roma! Roma! What was it to Alvina but a name, and a crowded, excited station, and Ciccio running after the luggage, and the pair of them eating in a station restaurant?\n\nAlmost immediately after eating, they were in the train once more, with new fellow travellers, running south this time towards Naples. In a daze of increasing weariness Alvina watched the dreary, to her sordid-seeming Campagna that skirts the railway, the broken aqueduct trailing in the near distance over the stricken plain. She saw a tram-car, far out from everywhere, running up to cross the railway. She saw it was going to Frascati.\n\nAnd slowly the hills approached\u2014they passed the vines of the foothills, the reeds, and were among the mountains. Wonderful little towns perched fortified on rocks and peaks, mountains rose straight up off the level plain, like old topographical prints, rivers wandered in the wild, rocky places, it all seemed ancient and shaggy, savage still, under all its remote civilization, this region of the Alban Mountains south of Rome. So the train clambered up and down, and went round corners.\n\nThey had not far to go now. Alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like. They were going to Ciccio's native village. They were to stay in the house of his uncle, his mother's brother. This uncle had been a model in London. He had built a house on the land left by Ciccio's grandfather. He lived alone now, for his wife was dead and his children were abroad. Giuseppe was his son: Giuseppe of Battersea, in whose house Alvina had stayed.\n\nThis much Alvina knew. She knew that a portion of the land down at Pescocalascio belonged to Ciccio: a bit of half-savage, ancient earth that had been left to his mother by old Francesco Califano, her hard-grinding peasant father. This land remained integral in the property, and was worked by Ciccio's two uncles, Pancrazio and Giovanni. Pancrazio was the well-to-do uncle, who had been a model and had built a \"villa.\" Giovanni was not much good. That was how Ciccio put it.\n\nThey expected Pancrazio to meet them at the station. Ciccio collected his bundles and put his hat straight and peered out of the window into the steep mountains of the afternoon. There was a town in the opening between steep hills, a town on a flat plain that ran into the mountains like a gulf. The train drew up. They had arrived.\n\nAlvina was so tired she could hardly climb down to the platform. It was about four o'clock. Ciccio looked up and down for Pancrazio, but could not see him. So he put his luggage into a pile on the platform, told Alvina to stand by it, whilst he went off for the registered boxes. A porter came and asked her questions, of which she understood nothing. Then at last came Ciccio, shouldering one small trunk, whilst a porter followed, shouldering another. Out they trotted, leaving Alvina abandoned with the pile of hand luggage. She waited. The train drew out. Ciccio and the porter came bustling back. They took her out through the little gate, to where, in the flat desert space behind the railway, stood two great drab motor-omnibuses, and a rank of open carriages. Ciccio was handing up the handbags to the roof of one of the big post-omnibuses. When it was finished the man on the roof came down, and Ciccio gave him and the station porter each sixpence. The station-porter immediately threw his coin on the ground with a gesture of indignant contempt, spread his arms wide and expostulated violently. Ciccio expostulated back again, and they pecked at each other, verbally, like two birds. It ended by the rolling up of the burly, black moustached driver of the omnibus. Whereupon Ciccio quite amicably gave the porter two nickel twopences in addition to the sixpence, whereupon the porter quite lovingly wished him \"buon' viaggio.\"\n\nSo Alvina was stowed into the body of the omnibus, with Ciccio at her side. They were no sooner seated than a voice was heard, in beautifully-modulated English:\n\n\"You are here! Why how have I missed you?\"\n\nIt was Pancrazio, a smallish, rather battered-looking, shabby Italian of sixty or more, with a big moustache and reddish-rimmed eyes and a deeply-lined face. He was presented to Alvina.\n\n\"How have I missed you?\" he said. \"I was on the station when the train came, and I did not see you.\"\n\nBut it was evident he had taken wine. He had no further opportunity to talk. The compartment was full of large, mountain-peasants with black hats and big cloaks and overcoats. They found Pancrazio a seat at the far end, and there he sat, with his deeply-lined, impassive face and slightly glazed eyes. He had yellow-brown eyes like Ciccio. But in the uncle the eyelids dropped in a curious, heavy way, the eyes looked dull like those of some old, rakish tom-cat, they were slightly rimmed with red. A curious person! And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced. He glanced at Alvina with slow, impersonal glances, not at all a stare. And he sat for the most part impassive and abstract as a Red Indian.\n\nAt the last moment a large black priest was crammed in, and the door shut behind him. Every available seat was let down and occupied. The second great post-omnibus rolled away, and then the one for Mola followed, rolling Alvina and Ciccio over the next stage of their journey.\n\nThe sun was already slanting to the mountain tops, shadows were falling on the gulf of the plain. The omnibus charged at a great speed along a straight white road, which cut through the cultivated level straight towards the core of the mountain. By the road-side, peasant men in cloaks, peasant women in full-gathered dresses with white bodices or blouses having great full sleeves, tramped in the ridge of grass, driving cows or goats, or leading heavily-laden asses. The women had coloured kerchiefs on their heads, like the women Alvina remembered at the Sunday-School treats, who used to tell fortunes with green little love-birds. And they all tramped along towards the blue shadow of the closing-in mountains, leaving the peaks of the town behind on the left.\n\nAt a branch-road the 'bus suddenly stopped, and there it sat calmly in the road beside an icy brook, in the falling twilight. Great moth-white oxen waved past, drawing a long, low load of wood; the peasants left behind began to come up again, in picturesque groups. The icy brook tinkled, goats, pigs and cows wandered and shook their bells along the grassy borders of the road and the flat, unbroken fields, being driven slowly home. Peasants jumped out of the omnibus on to the road, to chat\u2014and a sharp air came in. High overhead, as the sun went down, was the curious icy radiance of snow mountains, and a pinkness, while shadow deepened in the valley.\n\nAt last, after about half an hour, the youth who was conductor of the omnibus came running down the wild side-road, everybody clambered in, and away the vehicle charged, into the neck of the plain. With a growl and a rush it swooped up the first loop of the ascent. Great precipices rose on the right, the ruddiness of sunset above them. The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass. The omnibus pegged slowly up, then charged round a corner, swirled into another loop, and pegged heavily once more. It seemed dark between the closing-in mountains. The rocks rose very high, the road looped and swerved from one side of the wide defile to the other, the vehicle pulsed and persisted. Sometimes there was a house, sometimes a wood of oak-trees, sometimes the glimpse of a ravine, then the tall white glisten of snow above the earthly blackness. And still they went on and on, up the darkness.\n\nPeering ahead, Alvina thought she saw the hollow between the peaks, which was the top of the pass. And every time the omnibus took a new turn, she thought it was coming out on the top of this hollow between the heights. But no\u2014the road coiled right away again.\n\nA wild little village came in sight. This was the destination. Again no. Only the tall, handsome mountain youth who had sat across from her, descended grumbling because the 'bus had brought him past his road, the driver having refused to pull up. Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow. The big priest squeezed into his place. The 'bus wound on and on, and always towards that hollow sky-line between the high peaks.\n\nAt last they ran up between buildings nipped between high rock-faces, and out into a little market-place, the crown of the pass. The luggage was got out and lifted down. Alvina descended. There she was, in a wild centre of an old, unfinished little mountain town. The fa\u00e7ade of a church rose from a small eminence. A white road ran to the right, where a great open valley showed faintly beyond and beneath. Low, squalid sort of buildings stood around\u2014with some high buildings. And there were bare little trees. The stars were in the sky, the air was icy. People stood darkly, excitedly about, women with an odd, shell-pattern head-dress of gofered linen, something like a parlour-maid's cap, came and stared hard. They were hard-faced mountain women.\n\nPancrazio was talking to Ciccio in dialect.\n\n\"I couldn't get a cart to come down,\" he said in English. \"But I shall find one here. Now what will you do? Put the luggage in Grazia's place while you wait?\u2014\"\n\nThey went across the open place to a sort of shop called the Post Restaurant. It was a little hole with an earthen floor and a smell of cats. Three crones were sitting over a low brass brazier, in which charcoal and ashes smouldered. Men were drinking. Ciccio ordered coffee with rum\u2014and the hard-faced Grazia, in her unfresh head-dress, dabbled the little dirty coffee-cups in dirty water, took the coffee-pot out of the ashes, poured in the old black boiling coffee three parts full, and slopped the cup over with rum. Then she dashed in a spoonful of sugar, to add to the pool in the saucer, and her customers were served.\n\nHowever, Ciccio drank up, so Alvina did likewise, burning her lips smartly. Ciccio paid and ducked his way out.\n\n\"Now what will you buy?\" asked Pancrazio.\n\n\"Buy?\" said Ciccio.\n\n\"Food,\" said Pancrazio. \"Have you brought food?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ciccio.\n\nSo they trailed up stony dark ways to a butcher, and got a big red slice of meat; to a baker, and got enormous flat loaves. Sugar and coffee they bought. And Pancrazio lamented in his elegant English that no butter was to be obtained. Everywhere the hard-faced women came and stared into Alvina's face, asking questions. And both Ciccio and Pancrazio answered rather coldly, with some hauteur. There was evidently not too much intimacy between the people of Pescocalascio and these semi-townfolk of Ossona. Alvina felt as if she were in a strange, hostile country, in the darkness of the savage little mountain town.\n\nAt last they were ready. They mounted into a two-wheeled cart, Alvina and Ciccio behind, Pancrazio and the driver in front, the luggage promiscuous. The bigger things were left for the morrow. It was icy cold, with a flashing darkness. The moon would not rise till later.\n\nAnd so, without any light but that of the stars, the cart went spanking and rattling downhill, down the pale road which wound down the head of the valley to the gulf of darkness below. Down in the darkness into the darkness they rattled, wildly, and without heed, the young driver making strange noises to his dim horse, cracking a whip and asking endless questions of Pancrazio.\n\nAlvina sat close to Ciccio. He remained almost impassive. The wind was cold, the stars flashed. And they rattled down the rough, broad road under the rocks, down and down in the darkness. Ciccio sat crouching forwards, staring ahead. Alvina was aware of mountains, rocks, and stars.\n\n\"I didn't know it was so wild!\" she said.\n\n\"It is not much,\" he said. There was a sad, plangent note in his voice. He put his hand upon her.\n\n\"You don't like it?\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's lovely\u2014wonderful,\" she said, dazed.\n\nHe held her passionately. But she did not feel she needed protecting. It was all wonderful and amazing to her. She could not understand why he seemed upset and in a sort of despair. To her there was magnificence in the lustrous stars and the steepnesses, magic, rather terrible and grand.\n\nThey came down to the level valley bed, and went rolling along. There was a house, and a lurid red fire burning outside against the wall, and dark figures about it.\n\n\"What is that?\" she said. \"What are they doing?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Ciccio. \"Cosa fanno li\u2014eh?\"\n\n\"Ka\u2014? Fanno il buga'\u2014\" said the driver.\n\n\"They are doing some washing,\" said Pancrazio, explanatory.\n\n\"Washing!\" said Alvina.\n\n\"Boiling the clothes,\" said Ciccio.\n\nOn the cart rattled and bumped, in the cold night, down the high-way in the valley. Alvina could make out the darkness of the slopes. Overhead she saw the brilliance of Orion. She felt she was quite, quite lost. She had gone out of the world, over the border, into some place of mystery. She was lost to Woodhouse, to Lancaster, to England\u2014all lost.\n\nThey passed through a darkness of woods, with a swift sound of cold water. And then suddenly the cart pulled up. Some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness.\n\n\"We must get down here\u2014the cart doesn't go any further,\" said\nPancrazio.\n\"Are we there?\" said Alvina.\n\n\"No, it is about a mile. But we must leave the cart.\"\n\nCiccio asked questions in Italian. Alvina climbed down.\n\n\"Good-evening! Are you cold?\" came a loud, raucous, American-Italian female voice. It was another relation of Ciccio's. Alvina stared and looked at the handsome, sinister, raucous-voiced young woman who stood in the light of the doorway.\n\n\"Rather cold,\" she said.\n\n\"Come in, and warm yourself,\" said the young woman.\n\n\"My sister's husband lives here,\" explained Pancrazio.\n\nAlvina went through the doorway into the room. It was a sort of inn. On the earthen floor glowed a great round pan of charcoal, which looked like a flat pool of fire. Men in hats and cloaks sat at a table playing cards by the light of a small lamp, a man was pouring wine. The room seemed like a cave.\n\n\"Warm yourself,\" said the young woman, pointing to the flat disc of fire on the floor. She put a chair up to it, and Alvina sat down. The men in the room stared, but went on noisily with their cards. Ciccio came in with luggage. Men got up and greeted him effusively, watching Alvina between whiles as if she were some alien creature. Words of American sounded among the Italian dialect.\n\nThere seemed to be a confab of some sort, aside. Ciccio came and said to her:\n\n\"They want to know if we will stay the night here.\"\n\n\"I would rather go on home,\" she said.\n\nHe averted his face at the word home.\n\n\"You see,\" said Pancrazio, \"I think you might be more comfortable here, than in my poor house. You see I have no woman to care for it\u2014\"\n\nAlvina glanced round the cave of a room, at the rough fellows in their black hats. She was thinking how she would be \"more comfortable\" here.\n\n\"I would rather go on,\" she said.\n\n\"Then we will get the donkey,\" said Pancrazio stoically. And Alvina followed him out on to the high-road.\n\nFrom a shed issued a smallish, brigand-looking fellow carrying a lantern. He had his cloak over his nose and his hat over his eyes. His legs were bundled with white rag, crossed and crossed with hide straps, and he was shod in silent skin sandals.\n\n\"This is my brother Giovanni,\" said Pancrazio. \"He is not quite sensible.\" Then he broke into a loud flood of dialect.\n\nGiovanni touched his hat to Alvina, and gave the lantern to Pancrazio. Then he disappeared, returning in a few moments with the ass. Ciccio came out with the baggage, and by the light of the lantern the things were slung on either side of the ass, in a rather precarious heap. Pancrazio tested the rope again.\n\n\"There! Go on, and I shall come in a minute.\"\n\n\"Ay-er-er!\" cried Giovanni at the ass, striking the flank of the beast. Then he took the leading rope and led up on the dark high-way, stalking with his dingy white legs under his muffled cloak, leading the ass. Alvina noticed the shuffle of his skin-sandalled feet, the quiet step of the ass.\n\nShe walked with Ciccio near the side of the road. He carried the lantern. The ass with its load plodded a few steps ahead. There were trees on the road-side, and a small channel of invisible but noisy water. Big rocks jutted sometimes. It was freezing, the mountain high-road was congealed. High stars flashed overhead.\n\n\"How strange it is!\" said Alvina to Ciccio. \"Are you glad you have come home?\"\n\n\"It isn't my home,\" he replied, as if the word fretted him. \"Yes, I like to see it again. But it isn't the place for young people to live in. You will see how you like it.\"\n\nShe wondered at his uneasiness. It was the same in Pancrazio. The latter now came running to catch them up.\n\n\"I think you will be tired,\" he said. \"You ought to have stayed at my relation's house down there.\"\n\n\"No, I am not tired,\" said Alvina. \"But I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall eat something when we come to my house.\"\n\nThey plodded in the darkness of the valley high-road. Pancrazio took the lantern and went to examine the load, hitching the ropes. A great flat loaf fell out, and rolled away, and smack came a little valise. Pancrazio broke into a flood of dialect to Giovanni, handing him the lantern. Ciccio picked up the bread and put it under his arm.\n\n\"Break me a little piece,\" said Alvina.\n\nAnd in the darkness they both chewed bread.\n\nAfter a while, Pancrazio halted with the ass just ahead, and took the lantern from Giovanni.\n\n\"We must leave the road here,\" he said.\n\nAnd with the lantern he carefully, courteously showed Alvina a small track descending in the side of the bank, between bushes. Alvina ventured down the steep descent, Pancrazio following showing a light. In the rear was Giovanni, making noises at the ass. They all picked their way down into the great white-bouldered bed of a mountain river. It was a wide, strange bed of dry boulders, pallid under the stars. There was a sound of a rushing river, glacial-sounding. The place seemed wild and desolate. In the distance was a darkness of bushes, along the far shore.\n\nPancrazio swinging the lantern, they threaded their way through the uneven boulders till they came to the river itself\u2014not very wide, but rushing fast. A long, slender, drooping plank crossed over. Alvina crossed rather tremulous, followed by Pancrazio with the light, and Ciccio with the bread and the valise. They could hear the click of the ass and the ejaculations of Giovanni.\n\nPancrazio went back over the stream with the light. Alvina saw the dim ass come up, wander uneasily to the stream, plant his fore legs, and sniff the water, his nose right down.\n\n\"Er! Err!\" cried Pancrazio, striking the beast on the flank.\n\nBut it only lifted its nose and turned aside. It would not take the stream. Pancrazio seized the leading rope angrily and turned upstream.\n\n\"Why were donkeys made! They are beasts without sense,\" his voice floated angrily across the chill darkness.\n\nCiccio laughed. He and Alvina stood in the wide, stony river-bed, in the strong starlight, watching the dim figures of the ass and the men crawl upstream with the lantern.\n\nAgain the same performance, the white muzzle of the ass stooping down to sniff the water suspiciously, his hind-quarters tilted up with the load. Again the angry yells and blows from Pancrazio. And the ass seemed to be taking the water. But no! After a long deliberation he drew back. Angry language sounded through the crystal air. The group with the lantern moved again upstream, becoming smaller.\n\nAlvina and Ciccio stood and watched. The lantern looked small up the distance. But there\u2014a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.\n\n\"He is going over,\" said Ciccio.\n\nPancrazio came hurrying back to the plank with the lantern.\n\n\"Oh the stupid beast! I could kill him!\" cried he.\n\n\"Isn't he used to the water?\" said Alvina.\n\n\"Yes, he is. But he won't go except where he thinks he will go. You might kill him before he should go.\"\n\nThey picked their way across the river bed, to the wild scrub and bushes of the farther side. There they waited for the ass, which came up clicking over the boulders, led by the patient Giovanni. And then they took a difficult, rocky track ascending between banks. Alvina felt the uneven scramble a great effort. But she got up. Again they waited for the ass. And then again they struck off to the right, under some trees.\n\nA house appeared dimly.\n\n\"Is that it?\" said Alvina.\n\n\"No. It belongs to me. But that is not my house. A few steps further. Now we are on my land.\"\n\nThey were treading a rough sort of grass-land\u2014and still climbing. It ended in a sudden little scramble between big stones, and suddenly they were on the threshold of a quite important-looking house: but it was all dark.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Pancrazio, \"they have done nothing that I told them.\" He made queer noises of exasperation.\n\n\"What?\" said Alvina.\n\n\"Neither made a fire nor anything. Wait a minute\u2014\"\n\nThe ass came up. Ciccio, Alvina, Giovanni and the ass waited in the frosty starlight under the wild house. Pancrazio disappeared round the back. Ciccio talked to Giovanni. He seemed uneasy, as if he felt depressed.\n\nPancrazio returned with the lantern, and opened the big door. Alvina followed him into a stone-floored, wide passage, where stood farm implements, where a little of straw and beans lay in a corner, and whence rose bare wooden stairs. So much she saw in the glimpse of lantern-light, as Pancrazio pulled the string and entered the kitchen: a dim-walled room with a vaulted roof and a great dark, open hearth, fireless: a bare room, with a little rough dark furniture: an unswept stone floor: iron-barred windows, rather small, in the deep-thickness of the wall, one-half shut with a drab shutter. It was rather like a room on the stage, gloomy, not meant to be lived in.\n\n\"I will make a light,\" said Pancrazio, taking a lamp from the mantel-piece, and proceeding to wind it up.\n\nCiccio stood behind Alvina, silent. He had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest. She turned to him.\n\n\"It's a beautiful room,\" she said.\n\nWhich, with its high, vaulted roof, its dirty whitewash, its great black chimney, it really was. But Ciccio did not understand. He smiled gloomily.\n\nThe lamp was lighted. Alvina looked round in wonder.\n\n\"Now I will make a fire. You, Ciccio, will help Giovanni with the donkey,\" said Pancrazio, scuttling with the lantern.\n\nAlvina looked at the room. There was a wooden settle in front of the hearth, stretching its back to the room. There was a little table under a square, recessed window, on whose sloping ledge were newspapers, scattered letters, nails and a hammer. On the table were dried beans and two maize cobs. In a corner were shelves, with two chipped enamel plates, and a small table underneath, on which stood a bucket of water with a dipper. Then there was a wooden chest, two little chairs, and a litter of faggots, cane, vine-twigs, bare maize-hubs, oak-twigs filling the corner by the hearth.\n\nPancrazio came scrambling in with fresh faggots.\n\n\"They have not done what I told them, the tiresome people!\" he said. \"I told them to make a fire and prepare the house. You will be uncomfortable in my poor home. I have no woman, nothing, everything is wrong\u2014\"\n\nHe broke the pieces of cane and kindled them in the hearth. Soon there was a good blaze. Ciccio came in with the bags and the food.\n\n\"I had better go upstairs and take my things off,\" said Alvina. \"I am so hungry.\"\n\n\"You had better keep your coat on,\" said Pancrazio. \"The room is cold.\" Which it was, ice-cold. She shuddered a little. She took off her hat and fur.\n\n\"Shall we fry some meat?\" said Pancrazio.\n\nHe took a frying-pan, found lard in the wooden chest\u2014it was the food-chest\u2014and proceeded to fry pieces of meat in a frying-pan over the fire. Alvina wanted to lay the table. But there was no cloth.\n\n\"We will sit here, as I do, to eat,\" said Pancrazio. He produced two enamel plates and one soup-plate, three penny iron forks and two old knives, and a little grey, coarse salt in a wooden bowl. These he placed on the seat of the settle in front of the fire. Ciccio was silent.\n\nThe settle was dark and greasy. Alvina feared for her clothes. But she sat with her enamel plate and her impossible fork, a piece of meat and a chunk of bread, and ate. It was difficult\u2014but the food was good, and the fire blazed. Only there was a film of wood-smoke in the room, rather smarting. Ciccio sat on the settle beside her, and ate in large mouthfuls.\n\n\"I think it's fun,\" said Alvina.\n\nHe looked at her with dark, haunted, gloomy eyes. She wondered what was the matter with him.\n\n\"Don't you think it's fun?\" she said, smiling.\n\nHe smiled slowly.\n\n\"You won't like it,\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" she cried, in panic lest he prophesied truly.\n\nPancrazio scuttled in and out with the lantern. He brought wrinkled pears, and green, round grapes, and walnuts, on a white cloth, and presented them.\n\n\"I think my pears are still good,\" he said. \"You must eat them, and excuse my uncomfortable house.\"\n\nGiovanni came in with a big bowl of soup and a bottle of milk. There was room only for three on the settle before the hearth. He pushed his chair among the litter of fire-kindling, and sat down. He had bright, bluish eyes, and a fattish face\u2014was a man of about fifty, but had a simple, kindly, slightly imbecile face. All the men kept their hats on.\n\nThe soup was from Giovanni's cottage. It was for Pancrazio and him. But there was only one spoon. So Pancrazio ate a dozen spoonfuls, and handed the bowl to Giovanni\u2014who protested and tried to refuse\u2014but accepted, and ate ten spoonfuls, then handed the bowl back to his brother, with the spoon. So they finished the bowl between them. Then Pancrazio found wine\u2014a whitish wine, not very good, for which he apologized. And he invited Alvina to coffee. Which she accepted gladly.\n\nFor though the fire was warm in front, behind was very cold. Pancrazio stuck a long pointed stick down the handle of a saucepan, and gave this utensil to Ciccio, to hold over the fire and scald the milk, whilst he put the tin coffee-pot in the ashes. He took a long iron tube or blow-pipe, which rested on two little feet at the far end. This he gave to Giovanni to blow the fire.\n\nGiovanni was a fire-worshipper. His eyes sparkled as he took the blowing tube. He put fresh faggots behind the fire\u2014though Pancrazio forbade him. He arranged the burning faggots. And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.\n\n\"Basta! Basta!\" said Ciccio. But Giovanni blew on, his eyes sparkling, looking to Alvina. He was making the fire beautiful for her.\n\nThere was one cup, one enamelled mug, one little bowl. This was the coffee-service. Pancrazio noisily ground the coffee. He seemed to do everything, old, stooping as he was.\n\nAt last Giovanni took his leave\u2014the kettle which hung on the hook over the fire was boiling over. Ciccio burnt his hand lifting it off. And at last, at last Alvina could go to bed.\n\nPancrazio went first with the candle\u2014then Ciccio with the black kettle\u2014then Alvina. The men still had their hats on. Their boots tramped noisily on the bare stairs.\n\nThe bedroom was very cold. It was a fair-sized room with a concrete floor and white walls, and window-door opening on a little balcony. There were two high white beds on opposite sides of the room. The wash-stand was a little tripod thing.\n\nThe air was very cold, freezing, the stone floor was dead cold to the feet. Ciccio sat down on a chair and began to take off his boots. She went to the window. The moon had risen. There was a flood of light on dazzling white snow tops, glimmering and marvellous in the evanescent night. She went out for a moment on to the balcony. It was a wonder-world: the moon over the snow heights, the pallid valley-bed away below; the river hoarse, and round about her, scrubby, blue-dark foothills with twiggy trees. Magical it all was\u2014but so cold.\n\n\"You had better shut the door,\" said Ciccio.\n\nShe came indoors. She was dead tired, and stunned with cold, and hopelessly dirty after that journey. Ciccio had gone to bed without washing.\n\n\"Why does the bed rustle?\" she asked him.\n\nIt was stuffed with dry maize-leaves, the dry sheathes from the cobs\u2014stuffed enormously high. He rustled like a snake among dead foliage.\n\nAlvina washed her hands. There was nothing to do with the water but throw it out of the door. Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water. What a blessed relief! She sighed as she dried herself.\n\n\"It does one good!\" she sighed.\n\nCiccio watched her as she quickly brushed her hair. She was almost stupefied with weariness and the cold, bruising air. Blindly she crept into the high, rustling bed. But it was made high in the middle. And it was icy cold. It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water. She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue. The blankets were heavy, heavy. She was dazed with excitement and wonder. She felt vaguely that Ciccio was miserable, and wondered why.\n\nShe woke with a start an hour or so later. The moon was in the room. She did not know where she was. And she was frightened. And she was cold. A real terror took hold of her. Ciccio in his bed was quite still. Everything seemed electric with horror. She felt she would die instantly, everything was so terrible around her. She could not move. She felt that everything around her was horrific, extinguishing her, putting her out. Her very being was threatened. In another instant she would be transfixed.\n\nMaking a violent effort she sat up. The silence of Ciccio in his bed was as horrible as the rest of the night. She had a horror of him also. What would she do, where should she flee? She was lost\u2014lost\u2014lost utterly.\n\nThe knowledge sank into her like ice. Then deliberately she got out of bed and went across to him. He was horrible and frightening, but he was warm. She felt his power and his warmth invade her and extinguish her. The mad and desperate passion that was in him sent her completely unconscious again, completely unconscious", "http://genius.com/D-h-lawrence-the-lost-girl-chap14-annotated"], "100821": ["1000 Words

get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently-funded trials. This is our core premise, and you\u2019re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of \u2018research about research\u2019. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer.\n\nWe can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug \u2013 antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on \u2013 then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That\u2019s a very significant difference.\n\nIn 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we\u2019ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that\u2019s a very big difference.\n\nWe\u2019ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently-funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor\u2019s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3\n\nThese are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it\u2019s always possible that someone \u2013 like me, for example \u2013 could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you.\n\nTo guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We\u2019ll explore this in more detail soon (p.14), since it\u2019s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done.\n\nSystematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we\u2019re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5\n\nI am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see.\n\nThere is one last study I\u2019d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted).\n\nFries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor\u2019s drug. There is a small punch-line coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The \u2018ranges\u2019 are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages.\n\nIn Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and \u2013 I like to imagine \u2013 fairly passive-aggressive sentence:\n\nThe results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor.\n\nThis extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that\u2019s all you\u2019d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great.\n\nHow does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they\u2019re more confident their treatment is going to \u2018win\u2019; this sounds reasonable, although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there\u2019s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you\u2019re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish \u2013 an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is \u2013 for interesting reasons we shall discuss \u2013 statistical poison). And so on.\n\nBut before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand.\n\nSometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it\u2019s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.\n\nIn fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today \u2013 right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation \u2013 that still wouldn\u2019t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is \u2013 as you\u2019ve now seen \u2013 fundamentally distorted.\n\nBut there is a way ahead.\n\nWhy missing data matters\n\nReboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I\u2019d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It\u2019s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA), which governs all drugs in the UK. Millions of doses are prescribed every year, around the world. Reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a piece of paper, a prescription, saying I wanted my patient to have this drug.\n\nBut we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation \u2013 searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators \u2013 they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers.\n\nWhen all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed.\n\nIt got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients\u2019 worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn\u2019t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry \u2013 and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know \u2013 you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.\n\nIf you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.\n\nIn a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that \u2018publication bias\u2019 \u2013 the process whereby negative results go unpublished \u2013 is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters.\n\nEvidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works \u2013 or doesn\u2019t work \u2013 in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together all of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it\u2019s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn\u2019t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn\u2019t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I\u2019m misleading you, and you\u2019re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish.\n\nThe repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn\u2019t an abstract academic pursuit: it\u2019s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering.\n\nTGN1412\n\nIn March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take place in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid \u00a32,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued. One developed pneumonia. And then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. Their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. With heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives.\n\nThe Department of Health convened an Expert Scientific Group to try to understand what had happened, and from this two concerns were raised.8 Firstly: can we stop things like this from happening again? It\u2019s plainly foolish, for example, to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a \u2018first-in-man\u2019 trial at the same time, if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity. New drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process, slowly, over a day. This idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media.\n\nLess noted was a second concern: could we have foreseen this disaster? TGN1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called CD28 on the white blood cells of the immune system. It was a new and experimental treatment, and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood, and hard to model in animals (unlike, say, blood pressure, because immune systems are very variable between different species). But as the final report found, there was experience with a similar intervention: it had simply not been published. One researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier, using an antibody that attached to the CD3, CD2 and CD28 receptors. The effects of this antibody had parallels with those of TGN1412, and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell. But nobody could possibly have known that, because these results were never shared with the scientific community. They sat unpublished, unknown, when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying, destructive, avoidable ordeal.\n\nThat original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to, and it\u2019s hard to blame him as an individual, because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal. The same culture exists today. The final report on TGN1412 concluded that sharing the results of all first-in-man studies was essential: they should be published, every last one, as a matter of routine. But phase 1 trial results weren\u2019t published then, and they\u2019re still not published now. In 2009, for the first time, a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first-in-man trials get published, and how many remain hidden.9 They took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year. After four years, nine out of ten remain unpublished; after eight years, four out of five were still unpublished.\n\nIn medicine, as we shall see time and again, research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain. With every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed, quite unnecessarily, to another TGN1412. Even a huge international news story, with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds, wasn\u2019t enough to get movement, because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t share the results of basic research, such as a small first-in-man study, we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future. Was this an extreme case? Is the problem limited to early, experimental, new drugs, in small groups of trial participants? No.\n\nIn the 1980s, doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who\u2019d had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who\u2019ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who\u2019d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible, preventive measure.\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nCould anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who\u2019d had a heart attack \u2013 less than a hundred \u2013 to see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn\u2019t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll \u2013 over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely \u2013 might have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:\n\nWhen we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of \u2018publication bias\u2019. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10\n\nAs we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.\n\nBecause researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it\u2019s dangerous? No one can tell.\n\nThis is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we\u2019ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes.\n\nWhy we summarise data\n\nMissing data has been studied extensively in medicine. But before I lay out that evidence, we need to understand exactly why it matters, from a scientific perspective. And for that we need to understand systematic reviews and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. Between them, these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine. They are incredibly simple, but they were invented shockingly late.\n\nWhen we want to find out if something works or not, we do a trial. This is a very simple process, and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the Bible (Daniel 1:12, if you\u2019re interested). Firstly, you need an unanswered question: for example, \u2018Does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving?\u2019 Then you find some relevant participants, in this case, mothers about to deliver a premature baby. You\u2019ll need a reasonable number of them, let\u2019s say two hundred for this trial. Then you divide them into two groups at random, give the mothers in one group the current best treatment (whatever that is in your town), while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids. Finally, when all two hundred women have gone through your trial, you count up how many babies survived in each group.\n\nThis is a real-world question, and lots of trials were done on this topic, starting from 1972 onwards: two trials showed that steroids saved lives, but five showed no significant benefit. Now, you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed, and this is exactly that kind of situation. A doctor with a strong pre-existing belief that steroids work \u2013 perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism, by which the drug might do something useful in the body \u2013 could come along and say: \u2018Look at these two positive trials! Of course we must give steroids!\u2019 A doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say: \u2018Overall the evidence shows no benefit. Why take a risk?\u2019\n\nUp until very recently, this was basically how medicine progressed. People would write long, languorous review articles \u2013 essays surveying the literature \u2013 in which they would cite the trial data they\u2019d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion, often reflecting their own prejudices and values. Then, in the 1980s, people began to do something called a \u2018systematic review\u2019. This is a clear, systematic survey of the literature, with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic, without being biased towards any particular set of findings. In a systematic review, you describe exactly how you looked for data: which databases you searched, which search engines and indexes you used, even what words you searched for. You pre-specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review, and then you present everything you\u2019ve found, including the papers you rejected, with an explanation of why. By doing this, you ensure that your methods are fully transparent, replicable and open to criticism, providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence. It may sound like a simple idea, but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine, and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got all the trial data in one place, you can conduct something called a meta-analysis, where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet, pool all the data and get one single, summary figure, the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question. The output of this is called a \u2018blobbogram\u2019, and you can see one on the opposite page, in the logo of the Cochrane Collaboration, a global, non-profit academic organisation that has been producing gold-standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s.\n\nThis blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive. Each horizontal line is a trial: if that line is further to the left, then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives. The central, vertical line is the \u2018line of no effect\u2019: and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect, then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit. Some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines: these were smaller trials, with fewer participants, which means they are prone to more error, so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty, and therefore the horizontal line is longer. Finally, the diamond at the bottom shows the \u2018summary effect\u2019: this is the overall benefit of the intervention, pooling together the results of all the individual trials. These are much narrower than the lines for individual trials, because the estimate is much more accurate: it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients. On this blobbogram you can see \u2013 because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect \u2013 that giving steroids is hugely beneficial. In fact, it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half.\n\nThe amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented, and this happened very late in medicine\u2019s history. For many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives, but nobody knew they were effective, because nobody did a systematic review until 1989. As a result, the treatment wasn\u2019t given widely, and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily; not because we didn\u2019t have the information, but simply because we didn\u2019t synthesise it together properly.\n\nIn case you think this is an isolated case, it\u2019s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times. The diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms, or \u2018forest plots\u2019, showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase, a clot-busting drug, improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack.11\n\nLook first only at the forest plot on the left. This is a conventional forest plot, from an academic journal, so it\u2019s a little busier than the stylised one in the Cochrane logo. The principles, however, are exactly the same. Each horizontal line is a trial, and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results, with some trials showing a benefit (they don\u2019t touch the vertical line of no effect, headed \u20181\u2019) and some showing no benefit (they do cross that line). At the bottom, however, you can see the summary effect \u2013 a dot on this old-fashioned blobbogram, rather than a diamond. And you can see very clearly that overall, streptokinase saves lives.\n\nSo what\u2019s that on the right? It\u2019s something called a cumulative meta-analysis. If you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram, you can see that they are arranged in order of date. The cumulative meta-analysis on the right adds in each new trial\u2019s results, as they arrived over history, to the previous trials\u2019 results. This gives the best possible running estimate, each year, of how the evidence would have looked at that time, if anyone had bothered to do a meta-analysis on all the data available to them. From this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines, the \u2018summary effects\u2019, narrow over time as more and more data is collected, and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate. You can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago \u2013 and crucially, they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t spotted it for yourself already \u2013 to be fair, the entire medical profession was slow to catch on \u2013 this chart has devastating implications. Heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death. We had a treatment that worked, and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked, but once again we didn\u2019t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer. Half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase, I think unethically, because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked: they were deprived of effective treatments. But they weren\u2019t alone, because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time.\n\nThese stories illustrate, I hope, why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so important: we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question, not just cherry-pick the bits that we stumble upon, or intuitively like the look of. Mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses are now used almost universally, to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question.\n\nBut these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous. If one researcher or doctor \u2018cherry-picks\u2019, when summarising the existing evidence, and looks only at the trials that support their hunch, then they can produce a misleading picture of the research. That is a problem for that one individual (and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them). But if we are all missing the negative trials, the entire medical and academic community, around the world, then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works \u2013 as we must do \u2013 we are all completely misled. We get a misleading impression of the treatment\u2019s effectiveness: we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits; or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial, when in reality it did harm.\n\nNow that you understand the importance of systematic reviews, you can see why missing data matters. But you can also appreciate that when I explain how much trial data is missing, I am giving you a clean overview of the literature, because I will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews.\n\nHow much data is missing?\n\nIf you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished, you have an interesting problem: you need to prove the existence of studies you don\u2019t have access to. To work around this, people have developed a simple approach: you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed, then check to see if they have been published. Finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job, and to achieve it people have used various strategies: trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees (or \u2018institutional review boards\u2019 in the USA), for example; or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 2004.12 This was no small task. The FDA archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug. But that\u2019s not all the trials, by any means, because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there; and the information that is provided by the FDA is hard to search, and often scanty. But it is an important subset of the trials, and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing, and why. It\u2019s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies.\n\nThe researchers found seventy-four studies in total, representing 12,500 patients\u2019 worth of data. Thirty-eight of these trials had positive results, and found that the new drug worked; thirty-six were negative. The results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs, in reality. Then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature, the material available to doctors and patients. This provided a very different picture. Thirty-seven of the positive trials \u2013 all but one \u2013 were published in full, often with much fanfare. But the trials with negative results had a very different fate: only three were published. Twenty-two were simply lost to history, never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty, disorganised, thin FDA files. The remaining eleven which had negative results in the FDA summaries did appear in the academic literature, but were written up as if the drug was a success. If you think this sounds absurd, I agree: we will see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, how a study\u2019s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings.\n\nThis was a remarkable piece of work, spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers, with no stand-out bad guy. It very clearly exposed a broken system: in reality we have thirty-eight positive trials and thirty-six negative ones; in the academic literature we have forty-eight positive trials and three negative ones. Take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind: \u2018thirty-eight positive trials, thirty-six negative\u2019; or \u2018forty-eight positive trials and only three negative\u2019.\n\nIf we were talking about one single study, from one single group of researchers, who decided to delete half their results because they didn\u2019t give the overall picture they wanted, then we would quite correctly call that act \u2018research misconduct\u2019. Yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs, but with whole studies going missing, by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals, spread around the world, in both the public and private sector, we accept it as a normal part of life.13 It passes by, under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing, as routine, despite the undeniable impact it has on patients.\n\nEven more strange is this: we\u2019ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science.\n\nThis was first formally documented by a psychologist called Theodore Sterling in 1959.14 He went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time, and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result. This, he explained, was plainly fishy: it couldn\u2019t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted, because if we believed that, we\u2019d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct. If psychologists really were so great at predicting results, there\u2019d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all. In 1995, at the end of his career, the same researcher came back to the same question, half a lifetime later, and found that almost nothing had changed.15\n\nSterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context, but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries. Francis Bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked, and forgetting those when it didn\u2019t.16 Fowler in 1786 listed the cases he\u2019d seen treated with arsenic, and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures, as others might be tempted to do, but had included them.17 To do otherwise, he explained, would have been misleading.\n\nYet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine. In 1980 Elina Hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid-1970s in Finland and Sweden had been left unpublished.18 Then, in 1986, an American researcher called Robert Simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer. This was an important study, because it looked at a life-or-death question. Combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects, and knowing this, many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single \u2018alkylating agent\u2019 drug first, before moving on to full chemotherapy. Simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature, read by doctors and academics. From this, giving a single drug first looked like a great idea: women with advanced ovarian cancer (which is not a good diagnosis to have) who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer.\n\nThen Simes had a smart idea. He knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished, and he had heard that papers with less \u2018exciting\u2019 results are the most likely to go missing. To prove that this has happened, though, is a tricky business: you need to find a fair, representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted, and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published, to see if there are any embarrassing differences. There was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator (we will discuss this problem in some detail later), so instead he went to the International Cancer Research Data Bank. This contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the USA, including most of the ones funded by the government, and many others from around the world. It was by no means a complete list, but it did have one crucial feature: the trials were registered before their results came in, so any list compiled from this source would be, if not complete, at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done, and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative.\n\nWhen Simes compared the results of the published trials against the pre-registered trials, the results were disturbing. Looking at the academic literature \u2013 the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish \u2013 alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea, reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly. But when you looked only at the pre-registered trials \u2013 the unbiased, fair sample of all the trials ever conducted \u2013 the new treatment was no better than old-fashioned chemotherapy.\n\nSimes immediately recognised \u2013 as I hope you will too \u2013 that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature. Everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted, to an extent that might be hard to measure, but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care. We were seeing the positive results, and missing the negative ones. There was one clear thing we should do about this: start a registry of all clinical trials, demand that people register their study before they start, and insist that they publish the results at the end.\n\nThat was 1986. Since then, a generation later, we have done very badly. In this book, I promise I won\u2019t overwhelm you with data. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want any drug company, or government regulator, or professional body, or anyone who doubts this whole story, to have any room to wriggle. So I\u2019ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials, as briefly as possible, showing the main approaches that have been used. All of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject, so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results.\n\nOne research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of, from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug, and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature. That\u2019s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above, where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants, and found that a 50/50 split of positive and negative results turned into forty-eight positive papers and just three negative ones. This method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Lee and colleagues, for example, looked for all of the 909 trials \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002: they \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, compared with only 36 per cent of the rest.19\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Melander, in 2003, looked for all forty-two trials on five \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0antidepressants that were submitted to the Swedish drug \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all twenty-one studies with significant results were published; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published.20\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Rising et al., in 2008, found more of those distorted write-ups \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that we\u2019ll be dissecting later: they looked for all trials on two \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0years\u2019 worth of approved drugs. In the FDA\u2019s summary of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results, once those could be found, there were 164 trials. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0likely to be published in academic papers than those with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes. On top of that, four of the trials with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes changed, once they appeared in the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, to favour the drug.21\n\nIf you prefer, you can look at conference presentations: a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences, but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature.22 Studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find, or cite, and are especially hard to assess, because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research (often as little as a paragraph). And as you will see shortly, not every trial is a fair test of a treatment. Some can be biased by design, so these details matter.\n\nThe most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010, and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations \u2013 in fields as diverse as anaesthetics, cystic fibrosis, oncology, and A&E \u2013 disappear before becoming fully-fledged academic papers.23 Overwhelmingly, unflattering results are much more likely to go missing.\n\nIf you\u2019re very lucky, you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started, perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question. From the pharmaceutical industry, up until very recently, you\u2019d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain. For publicly-funded research the story is a little different, and here we start to learn a new lesson: although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry, with the result that they set the tone for the community, this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0By 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on this approach. They found that studies with significant \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0results were two and a half times more likely to get \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published than those without.24\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0A paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0triallists sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health over \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the preceding ten years, and found, again, that studies with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0significant results were more likely to be published.25\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at drug trials notified to the Finnish National \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agency, and found that 47 per cent of the positive results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, but only 11 per cent of the negative ones.26\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at all the trials that had passed through the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963: 93 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the significant results were published, but only 70 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the negative ones.27\n\nThe point being made in this blizzard of data is simple: this is not an under-researched area; the evidence has been with us for a long time, and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous.\n\nTwo French studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach: they went to ethics committees, and got lists of all the studies they had approved, and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results, before finally tracking down the published academic papers.28 The first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published; the second that they were four times as likely. In Britain, two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by NHS R&D: it\u2019s not industry research, but it\u2019s worth noting anyway. This produced an unusual result: there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers.29\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough simply to list studies. Systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far, what do we see overall?\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet, to produce a summary figure on publication bias, because they are all very different, in different fields, with different methods. This is a concern in many meta-analyses (though it shouldn\u2019t be overstated: if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo, say, and they\u2019re all using the same outcome measurement, then you might be fine just lumping them all in together).\n\nBut you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups. The most current systematic review on publication bias, from 2010, from which the examples above are taken, draws together the evidence from various fields.30 Twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations, and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 1.62 times more likely to be published. For the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started, overall, significant results were 2.4 times more likely to be published. Those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem. They are current, and they are damning.\n\nAll of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter: in the real world of medicine, published evidence is used to make treatment decisions. This problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do, so it\u2019s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice. Firstly, as we saw in the case of reboxetine, doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use, and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering, or even death. We might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments, having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs. This wastes money, ultimately depriving patients of other treatments, since funding for health care is never infinite.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. NICE, for example, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, created by the British government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. It is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug\u2019s effectiveness: NICE has no more legal right to that data than you or I do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the NHS, for millions of people. In fact, as we shall see, the MHRA and EMA (the European Medicines Agency) \u2013 the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the UK \u2013 often have access to this information, but do not share it with the public, with doctors, or with NICE. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.\n\nSo, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.\n\nAt the same time, the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded, as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them. This affects everyone, but it is especially egregious in the world of \u2018orphan diseases\u2019, medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients, because these corners of medicine are already short of resources, and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies, since the opportunities for revenue are thinner. People working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions, but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease. If the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing, then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous: perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research; perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases, and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm. Nobody can tell you.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most shamefully, when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished, we betray the patients who participated in these studies: the people who have given their bodies, and sometimes their lives, in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge, that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future. In fact, their belief is not implicit: often it\u2019s exactly what we tell them, as researchers, and it is a lie, because the data might be withheld, and we know it.\n\nSo whose fault is this?\n\nWhy do negative trials disappear?\n\nIn a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data \u2013 in stories where we can identify individuals \u2013 sometimes with the assistance of regulators. When we get to these, I hope your rage might swell. But first, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development, and in completely unrelated fields of academia, where people are motivated only by reputation, and their own personal interests.\n\nIn many respects, after all, publication bias is a very human process. If you\u2019ve done a study and it didn\u2019t have an exciting, positive result, then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn\u2019t very interesting to other researchers. There\u2019s also the issue of incentives: academics are often measured, rather unhelpfully, by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers, and the number of \u2018high-impact\u2019 studies they get into glamorous well-read journals. If negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals, and less likely to be cited by other academics, then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower. With a positive finding, meanwhile, you get a sense of discovering something new. Everyone around you is excited, because your results are exceptional.\n\nOne clear illustration of this problem came in 2010. A mainstream American psychology researcher called Daryl Bem published a competent academic paper, in a well-respected journal, showing evidence of precognition, the ability to see into the future.fn1 These studies were well-designed, and the findings were statistically significant, but many people weren\u2019t very convinced, for the same reasons you aren\u2019t: if humans really could see into the future, we\u2019d probably know about it already; and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rather than one-off findings.\n\nBut in fact the study has been replicated, though Bem\u2019s positive results have not been. At least two groups of academics have rerun several of Bem\u2019s experiments, using the exact same methods, and both found no evidence of precognition. One group submitted their negative results to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, \u2013 the very same journal that published Bem\u2019s paper in 2010 \u2013 and that journal rejected their paper out of hand. The editor even came right out and said it: we never publish studies that replicate other work.\n\nHere we see the same problem as in medicine: positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones. Every now and then, a freak positive result is published showing, for example, that people can see into the future. Who knows how many psychologists have tried, over the years, to find evidence of psychic powers, running elaborate, time-consuming experiments, on dozens of subjects \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 and then found no evidence that such powers exist? Any scientist trying to publish such a \u2018So what?\u2019 finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously, at the best of times. Even with the clear target of Bem\u2019s paper on precognition, which was widely covered in serious newspapers across Europe and the USA, the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result. Yet replicating these findings was key \u2013 Bem himself said so in his paper \u2013 so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too.\n\nPeople working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you\u2019re hoping for appears. What does that mean? Sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems; but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context, perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question. Many research findings, remember, are not absolute black-and-white outcomes, but fragile statistical correlations. Under our current system, most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet, and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research, in ways that are not immediately obvious. For example, researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they\u2019ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke, or because they\u2019ve made some kind of mistake in their methods. In fact, the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place, because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding, simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work; and you also need to be absolutely certain that you\u2019ve excluded all technical problems, to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate. These barriers to refutation may partly explain why it\u2019s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong.31\n\nPublication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research. In 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal Nature how they tried to replicate fifty-three early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments: forty-seven of the fifty-three could not be replicated.32 This study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine, because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue: researchers build theories on the back of them, trust that they\u2019re valid, and investigate the same idea using other methods. If they are simply being led down the garden path, chasing up fluke errors, then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted, and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded.\n\nThe authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem. Fluke findings, they explained, are often more likely to be submitted to journals \u2013 and more likely to be published \u2013 than boring, negative ones. We should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results; but we should also give them more opportunity.\n\nThis means changing the behaviour of academic journals, and here we are faced with a problem. Although they are usually academics themselves, journal editors have their own interests and agendas, and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit, as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly. Whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia, but this is the current situation. Journals are the gatekeepers, they make decisions on what\u2019s relevant and interesting for their audience, and they compete for readers.\n\nThis can lead them to behave in ways that don\u2019t reflect the best interests of science, because an individual journal\u2019s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence. In newspaper journalism, there is a well-known aphorism: \u2018When a dog bites a man, that\u2019s not news; but when a man bites a dog \u2026\u2019 These judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively. One study in 2003, for example, looked at the BBC\u2019s health news coverage over several months, and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear. 8,571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking; but there were three stories for every death from new variant CJD, or \u2018mad cow disease\u2019.33 Another, in 1992, looked at print-media coverage of drug deaths, and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper; but every death from MDMA received, on average, one piece of news coverage.34\n\nIf similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals, then we have a problem. But can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck, preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use? This argument is commonly deployed by industry, and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse. Luckily, this has been the subject of some research; and overall, while journals aren\u2019t blameless, it\u2019s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious public-health problem. This is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials, with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions.\n\nBut to be kind, for the sake of completeness, and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals, we can see if what they claim is true.\n\nOne survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication. One hundred and twenty-four unpublished results were identified, by following up on every study approved by a group of US ethics committees, and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results, it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected.35 Perhaps, you might say, this was a freak finding. Another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal, and see if those with negative results are rejected more often. Where this has been tried, the journals seem blameless: 745 manuscripts submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) were followed up, and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and non-significant findings.36 The same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the BMJ, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.37 Again and again, no effect was found. Some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias, if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission, to get past editors\u2019 prejudices. It\u2019s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched, although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough.\n\nThese studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice. One last option is to run an experiment, sending identical papers to various journals, but changing the direction of the results at random, to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to do very often, because it wastes a lot of people\u2019s time; but since publication bias matters, it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions.\n\nIn 1990 a researcher called Epstein created a series of fictitious papers, with identical methods and presentation, differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results. He sent them at random to 146 social-work journals: the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time, and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time, a difference that wasn\u2019t large enough to be statistically significant.38\n\nOther studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale, not submitting a paper to a journal, but rather, with the assistance of the journal, sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers: these people do not make the final decision on publication, but they do give advice to editors, so a window into their behaviour would be useful. These studies have had more mixed results. In one from 1977, sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventy-five reviewers. Some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views.39\n\nAnother study, from 1994, looked at reviewers\u2019 responses to a paper on TENS machines: these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief. Thirty-three reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified, and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their pre-existing views, though the study was small.40 Another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments; it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them.41\n\nOne final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their pre-existing beliefs (a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results, when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted). Fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers, and they were all identical, except for the results they reported: half of the reviewers got results they would like, half got results they wouldn\u2019t. Reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they\u2019d like (97 per cent vs 80 per cent), more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn\u2019t like, and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked.42\n\nOverall, though, even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains, these results don\u2019t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials. In the experiments isolating the peer reviewers, those individual referees were biased in some studies, but they don\u2019t have the last word on publication, and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world, the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems. Journals may not be entirely innocent \u2013 The Trouble With Medical Journals by Richard Smith, previously editor of the BMJ, is an excellent overview of their faults;43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies. But it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door.\n\nIn the light of all this, the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing. In various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results, because they would just be rejected by journals: 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 1998;44 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 1991;45 and so on.46 If asked why they\u2019ve failed to send in research for publication, the most common reasons researchers give are negative results, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.\n\nThis is the more abstract end of academia \u2013 largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials \u2013 but it seems that academics are mistaken, at best, about the reasons why negative results go missing. Journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results, but they are hardly absolute, and much of the problem lies in academics\u2019 motivations and perceptions.\n\nMore than that, in recent years, the era of open-access academic journals has got going in earnest: there are now several, such as Trials, which are free to access, and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report, regardless of result, and will actively solicit negative findings. Trials registers like clinicaltrials.gov will also post results. With offers like this on the table, it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to. And yet, despite this, negative results continue to go missing, with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs, even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them.\n\nYou might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld. The universities where research takes place, for example; or the regulators; or the \u2018ethics committees\u2019, which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research. Unfortunately, our story is about to take a turn to the dark side. We will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have, instead, shirked their responsibilities; and worse than that, we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients. We are about to hit some big problems, some bad people, and some simple solutions.\n\nHow ethics committees and universities have failed us\n\nBy now, you will, I hope, share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical, for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm. But the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients.\n\nPatients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves: they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion, because clinical trials almost always require that you have more check-ups on your progress, more blood tests, and more examinations; but participants may also expose themselves to more risk, or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment. People do this out of altruism, on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and so will help other patients in the future. In fact, this understanding isn\u2019t just implicit: in many trials it\u2019s explicit, because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions. If this isn\u2019t true, and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company, then the patients have been actively lied to. That is very bad news.\n\nSo what are the formal arrangements between patients, researchers and sponsors? In any sensible world, we\u2019d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors \u2013 which have a huge interest in positive results \u2013 must have no control over the data. But despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. In fact, quite the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted, without the permission of the funder. This is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business, as we shall now see.\n\nIn 2006 a paper was published in JAMA describing how common it was for researchers doing industry-funded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results.47 The study was conducted by the Nordic Cochrane Centre, and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. (If you\u2019re wondering why these two cities were chosen, it was simply a matter of practicality, and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world: the researchers applied elsewhere without success, and were specifically refused access to data in the UK.48) These trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (98 per cent), and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the now-familiar line between frightening and absurd.\n\nFor sixteen of the forty-four trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated, and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time, for any reason. This means that a company can see if a trial is going against it, and can interfere as it progresses. As we will see later (early stopping, breaking protocols, pp.186, 202), this distorts a trial\u2019s results with unnecessary and hidden biases. For example, if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results, then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit, or bury a worsening negative result. Crucially, the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn\u2019t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials, so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject \u2013 by design \u2013 to such an important flaw.\n\nEven if the study was allowed to finish, the data could still be suppressed. There were constraints on publication rights in forty of the forty-four trials, and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright (what about the patients, you might say?), or needed to approve the final publication, or both. None of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers, and in fact, none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial, or the final say on whether to publish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking a moment to think about what this means. The results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature, because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result (or trials that do produce a negative result) can be deleted from the academic record; but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed.\n\nThe paper I\u2019ve just described was published in JAMA, one of the biggest medical journals in the world. Shortly afterwards, a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the BMJ.49 Lif, the Danish pharmaceutical industry association, responded to the paper by announcing in the Journal of the Danish Medical Association that it was \u2018both shaken and enraged about the criticism, that could not be recognised\u2019. It demanded an investigation of the scientists, though it failed to say by whom, or of what. Then Lif wrote to the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty, accusing the Cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct. We can\u2019t see the letter, but the Cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious \u2013 they were accused of deliberately distorting the data \u2013 but vague, and without documents or evidence to back them up.\n\nNonetheless, the investigation went on for a year, because in academia people like to do things properly, and assume that all complaints are made in good faith. Peter G\u00f8tzsche, the director of the Cochrane centre, told the BMJ that only Lif\u2019s third letter, ten months into this process, made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee. Two months later the charges were dismissed. The Cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong. But before they were cleared, Lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked, and to the management organisation running that hospital, and sent similar letters to the Danish Medical Association, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, and so on. G\u00f8tzsche and his colleagues said that they felt \u2018intimidated and harassed\u2019 by Lif\u2019s behaviour. Lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed. So, researching in this area is not easy: it\u2019s hard to get funding, and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps.\n\nEven though the problem has been widely recognised, attempts to fix it have failed.50 The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, for example, stood up in 2001, insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data, and full control over the decision to publish. Researchers at Duke University, North Carolina, then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors, and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine. They recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia. Was this imposed? No. Sponsors continue to control the data.\n\nHalf a decade later, a major study in the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether anything had changed.51 Administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the US were asked about their contracts (to be clear, this wasn\u2019t a study of what they did; rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public). The majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were \u2018difficult\u2019. A worrying 62 per cent said it was OK for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential. This is a serious problem, as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor, which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research. Half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper, which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine, as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced (as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 6). Half said it was OK for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published, once again hindering research. A quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript. Asked about disputes, 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year.\n\nSometimes, disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments, when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical. Aubrey Blumsohn was a senior lecturer at Sheffield University, working on a project funded by Procter & Gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate.52 The aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial, led by Blumsohn\u2019s head of department, Professor Richard Eastell. After signing the contracts, P&G sent over some \u2018abstracts\u2019, brief summaries of the findings, with Blumsohn\u2019s name as first author, and some summary results tables. That\u2019s great, said Blumsohn, but I\u2019m the researcher here: I\u2019d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself. The company declined, saying that this was not their policy. Blumsohn stood his ground, and the papers were left unpublished. Then, however, Blumsohn saw that Eastell had published another paper with P&G, stating that all the researchers had \u2018had full access to the data and analyses\u2019. He complained, knowing this was not true. Blumsohn was suspended by Sheffield University, which offered him a gagging clause and \u00a3145,000, and he was eventually forced out of his job. Eastell, meanwhile, was censured by the General Medical Council, but only after a staggering delay of several years, and he remains in post.\n\nSo contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common, and they\u2019re bad news. But that\u2019s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works. They also break another vitally important contract: the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials.\n\nPeople participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future. This isn\u2019t just speculation: one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018moderate\u2019 contribution to society, and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution.53 Patients are not stupid or na\u00efve to believe this, because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials. But they are mistaken, because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished, and withheld from doctors and patients. These signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points. Firstly, they fail to tell the truth: that the person conducting the trial, or the person paying for it, may decide not to publish the results, depending on how they look at the end of the study. And worse than that, they also explicitly state a falsehood: researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future, even though the researchers know that in many cases, those results will never be published.\n\nThere is only one conclusion that we can draw from this: consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate, closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork, and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment. Despite all this regulatory theatre, which hinders good research on routine practice (as we shall see \u2013 p.232), we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data, and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine. The deceit of these consent forms is, to me, a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become. But it also, finally, poses a serious problem for the future of research.\n\nWe desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society, because trial recruitment is in crisis, and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all. In one recent study, a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target, and more than half had to be awarded an extension.54 If word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific, recruitment will become even more difficult. The answer is not to hide this problem, but rather to fix it.\n\nSo universities and ethics committees may have failed us, but there is one group of people we might expect to step up, to try to show some leadership on missing trial data. These are the medical and academic professional bodies, the Royal Colleges of General Practice, Surgery and Physicians, the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the pharmacists\u2019 organisations, the bodies representing each sub-specialty of academia, the respiratory physiologists, the pharmacologists, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and so on.\n\nThese organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine, in their codes of conduct, their aspirations, and in some cases their rules, since some have the ability to impose sanctions, and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards. We have established, I hope, beyond any doubt, that non-publication of trials in humans is research misconduct, that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world. Have these organisations used their powers, stood up and announced, prominently and fiercely, that this must stop, and that they will take action?\n\nOne has: the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a small organisation of doctors \u2013 largely working in the industry \u2013 with 1,400 members. And none of the others have bothered.\n\nNot one.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThere are several simple solutions to these problems, which fall into three categories. There is no argument against any of the following suggestions that I am aware of. The issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia, and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry. Their failure to act harms patients every day.\n\nGagging clauses\n\nIf there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses \u2013 if companies, and legislators, and academics, and university contracts departments, all believe that they are acceptable \u2013 then everything should be out in the open, prominently flagged up, so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Until they can be eradicated, where gagging clauses exist, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients should be told, at the time they are invited to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0participate in a trial, that the company sponsoring it is allowed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to hide the results if it doesn\u2019t like them. The consent form \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should also explain clearly that withholding negative results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effectiveness of the treatment being trialled, and so exposed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to unnecessary harm. Trial participants can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to gag publication, even if it doesn\u2019t exercise that right, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the academic paper; in the trial protocol; and in the publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0starts. Readers of the trial findings can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publish all negative findings, and interpret any reported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0positive findings in that light.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All university contracts should follow the same boilerplate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0format, and forbid gagging clauses. Failing that, all universities \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should be forced to prominently declare which contracts \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with gagging clauses they have permitted, and to publish those \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0clauses online for all to see, so that all can be alerted that the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0institution is producing systematically biased research, and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0discount any findings from them accordingly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0In legislation, gagging clauses should be made illegal, with no \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0possibility of quibbles. If there is a dispute about analysis or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interpretation between the people running the trial and the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0people paying for it, it should take place in the published \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, or some other public forum. Not in secret.\n\nProfessional bodies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0All professional bodies should take a clear stand on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unpublished trial data, declare it clearly as research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct, and state that it will be handled like any other \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients.That they have not done so is a stain on the reputation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of these organisations, and on their senior members.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0All research staff involved in any trial on humans should be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published in full within one year of completion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.All those responsible for withholding trial data should have \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their names prominently posted in a single database, so \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that others can be made aware of the risk of working with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them, or allowing them access to patients for research, in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0future.\n\nEthics committees\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.No person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0research project they are responsible for is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0withholding trial data from publication more than one year \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after completion. Where any researcher on a project has a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0previous track record of delayed publication of trial data, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ethics committee should be notified, and this should be taken \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into account, as with any researcher guilty of research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.No trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publication within one year of completion.\n\nHow regulators and journals have failed us\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that ethics committees, universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias, even though the selective non-publication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine. We know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers, doctors and patients make, and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death. This is not seriously disputed, so you might reasonably imagine that governments, regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it.\n\nThey have tried, and failed. Worse than simply failing, they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as \u2018fake fixes\u2019: we have seen small changes in regulations and practices, announced with great fanfare, but then either ignored or bypassed. This has given false reassurance to doctors, academics and the public that the problem has been fixed. What follows is the story of these fake fixes.\n\nRegisters\n\nThe earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials: if people are compelled to publish their protocol, in full, before they start work, then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they\u2019ve published the trials that they\u2019ve conducted. This is very useful, for a number of reasons. A trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial: how many patients they\u2019ll recruit, where they\u2019ll come from, how they\u2019ll be divided up, what treatment each group will get, and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful. Because of this, it can be used to check whether a trial was published, but also whether its methods were distorted along the way, in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated (as described in Chapter 4).\n\nThe first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 1986,55 and it was followed by a flood. In 1990 Iain Chalmers (we can call him Sir Iain Chalmers if you likefn2) published a classic paper called \u2018Underreporting Research is Scientific Misconduct\u2019,57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the UK.58 In 1992, as the Cochrane Collaboration began to gather influence, representatives of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) asked to meet Chalmers.59 After explaining the work of Cochrane, and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug, he explained very clearly to them how biased under-reporting of results harms patients.\n\nThe industry\u2019s representatives were moved, and soon they took action. Mike Wallace, the chief executive of Schering and a member of that ABPI delegation, agreed with Chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible, and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it, if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms. Wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues, and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with Cochrane. This was not a popular move, and he was reprimanded by colleagues, in particular those from other companies.\n\nBut then GlaxoWellcome followed suit, and in 1998 its chief executive, Richard Sykes, wrote an editorial in the BMJ called \u2018Being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes\u2019.60 \u2018Programmes\u2019 was the crucial word, because as we\u2019ve seen, and as we shall see in greater detail later, you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug.\n\nGlaxoWellcome set up a clinical trials registry, and Elizabeth Wager, the head of the company\u2019s medical writers group, pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research. The ABPI, seeing individual companies take the lead, saw the writing on the wall: it decided to commend GlaxoWellcome\u2019s policy to the whole industry, and launched this initiative at a press conference where Chalmers \u2013 a strong critic \u2013 sat on the same side of the table as the industry. AstraZeneca, Aventis, MSD, Novartis, Roche, Schering Healthcare and Wyeth began registering some of their trials \u2013 only the ones involving UK patients, and retrospectively \u2013 but there was movement at last.\n\nAt the same time, there was movement in America. The 1997 FDA Modernization Act created clinicaltrials.gov, a register run by the US government National Institutes of Health. This legislation required that trials should be registered, but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market, and even then, only if it was for a serious or life-threatening disease. The register opened in 1998, and the website clinicaltrials.gov went online in 2000. The entry criteria were widened in 2004.\n\nBut soon it all began to fall apart. GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham to become GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register. Iain Chalmers wrote to Jean-Paul Garnier, the chief executive of the new company, to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency: but no reply ever came. The registry website was closed, and the contents were lost (though GSK was later forced to open a new register, as part of a settlement with the US government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later). Elizabeth Wager, the author of the Good Publication Practice guidelines for drug companies, was out of a job, as her writing department at GSK was closed. Her guidelines were ignored.61\n\nFrom the moment that these registries were first suggested, and then opened, it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record, and then not publishing your study, would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing. But the first problem for the US register, which could have been used universally, was that people simply chose not to use it. The regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted, and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn\u2019t have to.\n\nIn 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) \u2013 a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world \u2013 published a policy statement, announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005, unless they had been properly registered before they began.62 They did this, essentially, to force the hand of the industry and researchers: if a trial has a positive result, then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find. Although they had no legal force, the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most: the chance of a major journal publication. By insisting on pre-registration, they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials. Everyone rejoiced: the problem had been fixed.\n\nIf you think it seems odd \u2013 and perhaps unrealistic \u2013 that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a $700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors, with no legislative power, then you\u2019d be right. Although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past, in reality it was continuing just as before, because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises. Later (pp.247, 307) we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers, which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue. But first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals, every one of which was a member of the ICMJE, after the deadline for pre-registration. Out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these high-impact academic journals, only half were adequately registered (before the trial, with the main outcome measure properly specified), and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter.63 The ICMJE editors had simply failed to keep their word.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, there were some very bizarre developments. With enormous fanfare, the European Medicines Agency created a registry of trials called EudraCT. EU legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in Europe, and many companies will tell you that they\u2019ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so. But the contents of this EU register have been kept entirely secret. I can tell you that it contains around 30,000 trials, since that figure is in the public domain, but that is literally all I know, and all anyone can know. Despite EU legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register, it remains closed. This creates an almost laughable paradox: the EU clinical trials register is a transparency tool, held entirely in secret. Since March 2011, after heavy media criticism (from me at any rate), a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called EudraPharm. As of summer 2012, although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all, at least 10,000 trials are still missing, and the search engine doesn\u2019t work properly.64 It\u2019s absolutely one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever seen, and nobody other than the EU even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register: I certainly don\u2019t, I doubt you do, and both the ICMJE and the World Health Organization have explicitly stated that EudraCT is not a meaningful register.\n\nBut new work was being done in the US, and it seemed sensible. In 2007 the FDA Amendment Act was passed. This is much tighter: it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device, at any stage of development other than \u2018first-in-man\u2019 tests, if they have any site in the US, or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market. It also imposes a startling new requirement: all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrials.gov, in abbreviated summary tables, within one year of completion, for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007.\n\nOnce again, to great fanfare, everyone believed that the problem had been fixed. But it hasn\u2019t been, for two very important reasons.\n\nFirstly, unfortunately, despite the undoubted goodwill, requiring the publication of all trials starting from \u2018now\u2019 does absolutely nothing for medicine today. There is no imaginable clinic, anywhere in the world, at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years, using only drugs that came to market since 2008. In fact, quite the opposite is true: the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten, twenty or thirty years, and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the \u2018golden era\u2019 of pharmaceutical research, when all the most widely used drugs, for all the most common diseases, were developed. Perhaps they were the \u2018low-lying fruit\u2019, plucked from the research tree, but in any case, these are the tablets we use.\n\nAnd crucially, it is for these drugs \u2013 the ones we actually use \u2013 that we need the evidence: from trials completed in 2005 or 1995. These are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind, misled by a biased sample of trials, selectively published, with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills (I am told) of Cheshire.\n\nBut there is a second, more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt: they have been widely ignored. A study published in January 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting, and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results.65 Perhaps this is not surprising: the fine for non-compliance is $10,000 a day, which sounds spectacular, until you realise that it\u2019s only $3.5 million a year, which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in $4 billion a year. And what\u2019s more, no such fine has ever been levied, throughout the entire history of the legislation.\n\nSo that, in total, is why I regard the ICMJE, the FDA and the EU\u2019s claims to have addressed this problem as \u2018fake fixes\u2019. In fact, they have done worse than fail: they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed, false reassurance that it has gone away, and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball. For half a decade now, people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday\u2019s problem, discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, and swiftly fixed.\n\nBut the problem of missing data has not gone away, and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be, in the very present day.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe ICMJE should keep its promises, the EU should be less risible, and the FDA Amendment Act 2007 should be muscularly enforced. But there are many more disappointments to come, so I will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter.\n\nBlood from a stone: trying to get data from regulators\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations, all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data, since it harms patients in large numbers around the world. We have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results, despite the public pretence to the contrary; and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials. We have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials, despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand. We have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication, despite their stated aim of protecting patients. And we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct, despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions.66\n\nWhile the published academic record is hopelessly distorted, you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials: the regulators, which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process, must surely have obligations to protect patients\u2019 safety? But this, sadly, is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us.\n\nIn this section, we will see three key failures. Firstly, the regulators may not have the information in the first place. Secondly, the way in which they \u2018share\u2019 summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby. And finally, if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided \u2013 the long-form documents, where the bodies are often buried \u2013 then regulators present bizarre barriers, blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time, even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful. Nothing of what I am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring.\n\nOne: Information is withheld from regulators\n\nParoxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as \u2018selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u2019, or SSRIs. You will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book, but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials, and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure. We will see that GSK withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant, and even withheld data about its harmful side effects, but most importantly, we will see that what it did was all entirely legal.\n\nTo understand why, we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process. Drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions: for any specific use of any drug, in any specific disease, you need a separate marketing authorisation. So, a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer, for example, but not breast cancer. That doesn\u2019t mean the drug doesn\u2019t work in breast cancer. There might well be some evidence that it\u2019s great for treating that disease too, but maybe the company hasn\u2019t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use. Doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer, if they want, because the drug is available for prescription, and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out (even though, strictly speaking, it\u2019s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer). In this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally, but \u2018off-label\u2019.\n\nThis is fairly common, as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be time-consuming and expensive. If doctors know that there\u2019s a drug which has been shown in good-quality trials to help treat a disease, it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it, just because the company hasn\u2019t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use. I\u2019ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later. But for now, what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults.\n\nThis makes sense in many cases, because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults, so the risks and benefits might be very different, and research needs to be done in children separately. But this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages. Getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business, requiring lots of paperwork, and some specific studies. Often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children, because that market is usually much smaller.\n\nBut once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing, as we have seen, it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything. So it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults, but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch; or a judgement that it should at least do no harm; or studies that suggest benefit in children, but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids; or even good studies, but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can\u2019t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children.\n\nRegulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children \u2018off-label\u2019, without adequate research, so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research, and formally seek these licences. The incentives are patent extensions, and these can be lucrative. All drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market, and become like paracetamol, which anyone can make very cheaply. If a company is given a six-month extension on a drug, for all uses, then it can make a lot more money from that medicine. This seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic, and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer. Licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money, since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already, even without a licence or good evidence, simply because there are no other options. Meanwhile, six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative, if its adult market is large enough.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers. For example, since the FDA started offering this deal, about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences, but many of them were for diseases that aren\u2019t very common in children, like stomach ulcers, or arthritis. There have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children, such as more modern medicines called \u2018large-molecule biologics\u2019. But there it is.\n\nWhen GSK applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine, an extraordinary situation came to light, triggering the longest investigation in the history of UK drugs regulation. This investigation was published in 2008, and examined whether GSK should face criminal charges.67 It turned out that what the company had done \u2013 withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see \u2013 was plainly unethical, and put children around the world at risk; but our laws are so weak that GSK could not be charged with any crime.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2002 GSK conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children.68 The first two failed to show any benefit, but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the \u2018drug label\u2019 that is sent to all doctors and patients. In fact, after these trials were completed, an internal company management document stated: \u2018it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine\u2019. In the year after this secret internal memo, 32,000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the UK alone: so, while the company knew the drug didn\u2019t work in children, it was in no hurry to tell doctors that, despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it. More trials were conducted over the coming years \u2013 nine in total \u2013 and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children.\n\nIt gets much worse than that. These children weren\u2019t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them: they were also being exposed to side effects. This should be self-evident, since any effective treatment will have some side effects, and doctors factor this in, alongside the benefits (which in this case were non-existent). But nobody knew how bad these side effects were, because the company didn\u2019t tell doctors, or patients, or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials. This was because of a loophole (on which more in a couple of pages\u2019 time): you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation. Because the use of paroxetine in children was \u2018off-label\u2019, GSK had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found.\n\nPeople had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide, though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant, because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway, as a result of their depression. There are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression, and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery, there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves, just because of the depression slowly lifting.\n\nFurthermore, suicide is a mercifully rare event, which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk. Also, suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates, because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful, so the signal you are trying to detect in the data \u2013 suicide \u2013 is going to be corrupted. Suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don\u2019t result in death are more common than suicide itself, so they should be easier to detect, but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data, because they\u2019re often not presented to doctors, and where they are, they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways, if they appear at all. Because of all these difficulties, you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children; and you would want a lot of experienced people, with a wide range of skills, all looking at the data and discussing it.\n\nIn February 2003, GSK spontaneously sent the MHRA a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine, containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverse-event data in trials the company had held, going back a decade. This analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide. But it was misleading: although it was unclear at the time, data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults, which had vastly greater numbers of participants. As a result, any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away.\n\nLater in 2003, GSK had a meeting with the MHRA to discuss another issue involving paroxetine. At the end of this meeting, the GSK representatives gave out a briefing document, explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children. They mentioned, while handing out the document, that the MHRA might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted: an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine, compared with those on dummy placebo pills.\n\nThis was vitally important side-effect data, being presented, after an astonishing delay, casually, through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel. GSK knew that the drug was being prescribed in children, and it knew that there were safety concerns in children, but it had chosen not to reveal that information. When it did share the data, it didn\u2019t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug, requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator; instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application. Although the data was given to completely the wrong team, the MHRA staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem. A flurry of activity followed: analyses were done, and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen.\n\nHow is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective, but actively dangerous? There are two sets of problems here: firstly, access for regulators; and secondly, access for doctors.\n\nThere is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes, and it\u2019s dismal to see how GSK cheerfully exploited them. As I\u2019ve mentioned, the company had no legal duty to give over the information, because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine\u2019s formally licensed uses \u2013 even though GSK knew this was widespread. In fact, of the nine studies the company conducted, only one had its results reported to the MHRA, because that was the only one conducted in the UK.\n\nAfter this episode, the MHRA and the EU changed some of their regulations, though not adequately, and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation, closing the paroxetine loophole.\n\nThis whole incident illustrates a key problem, and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book: you need all of the data in order to see what\u2019s happening with a drug\u2019s benefits, and risks. Some of the trials that GSK conducted were published in part, but that is obviously not enough: we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data, we are misled. But we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data: safety signals are often weak, subtle and difficult to detect. Suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children \u2013 even those with depression, even those on paroxetine \u2013 so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise. In the case of paroxetine, the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together.\n\nThat leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system: the results of these trials \u2013 the safety data and the effectiveness data \u2013 are given in secret to the regulator, which then sits and quietly makes a decision. This is a huge problem, because you need many eyes on these difficult problems. I don\u2019t think that the people who work in the MHRA are bad, or incompetent: I know a lot of them, and they are smart, good people. But we shouldn\u2019t trust them to analyse this data alone, in the same way that we shouldn\u2019t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone, with nobody looking over its shoulder, checking the working, providing competition, offering helpful criticism, speeding it up, and so on.\n\nThis is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data, because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done, and how. The output of a regulator is often simply a crude, brief summary: almost a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 about side effects. This is the opposite of science, which is only reliable because everyone shows their working, explains how they know that something is effective or safe, shares their methods and their results, and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data.\n\nYet for the safety and efficacy of drugs, one of the most important of all analyses done by science, we turn our back on this process completely: we allow it to happen behind closed doors, because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators. So the most important job in evidence-based medicine, and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds, is carried out alone and in secret.\n\nThis perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators. NICE, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most cost-effective, and which work best. When it does this, it\u2019s in the same boat as you or me: it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug, if a company doesn\u2019t want to release it, even though the regulators have all of that data. For \u2018single technology appraisals\u2019, on one treatment, they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant. For \u2018guidelines\u2019 on treatment in a whole area of medicine, they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals. As a result, even NICE can end up working on distorted, edited, biased samples of the data.\n\nSometimes NICE is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies: this is information that doctors and patients aren\u2019t allowed to see, despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs, or are actually taking them. But when NICE does get information in this way, it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality, leading to some very bizarre documents being published. On the opposite page, for example, is the NICE document discussing whether it\u2019s a good idea to have Lucentis, an extremely expensive drug, costing well over \u00a31,000 per treatment, that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration.\n\nAs you can see, the NICE document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored. Not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles, in case any doctor or patient should see it; absurdly, even the names of some trials are missing, preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence, or cross referencing information about them. Most disturbing of all, as you can see in the last bullet point, the data on adverse events is also censored: I\u2019m reproducing the whole page here because I worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe. This level of censorship isn\u2019t an everyday phenomenon; but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept, in professional documents that most people wouldn\u2019t bother to read.69\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we all \u2013 doctors, patients and NICE \u2013 have access to the information on trials that regulators see? This is something I asked both Kent Woods from the MHRA, and Hans Georg Eichler, Medical Director of the European Medicines Agency, in 2010. Both, separately, gave me the same answer: people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information, because they might misinterpret it, either deliberately or through incompetence. Both, separately \u2013 though I guess they must chat at parties \u2013 raised the MMR vaccine scare, as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence, creating dangerous public-health problems along the way. What if they released raw safety data, and people who don\u2019t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns, and created scares that put patients off taking life-saving medication?\n\nI accept that this is a risk, but I also believe their priorities are wrong: I think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous, and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data. Drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators\u2019 websites, in summary form.\n\nWe shall now see that this is untrue.\n\nTwo: Regulators make it hard to access the data they do have\n\nWhen exposed to criticism, drug companies often become indignant, and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed. \u2018We give everything to the regulator,\u2019 they say, \u2018and you can get it from them.\u2019 Similarly, regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website, and you will easily find all the data you need. In reality, there is a messy game, in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses, scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed.\n\nFirstly, as we\u2019ve already seen, regulators don\u2019t have all the trials, and they don\u2019t share all the ones that they do. Summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place, but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug. Even where the regulator has been given safety data for off-label uses (following the paroxetine case above) the information from these trials still isn\u2019t made publicly available through the regulator: it simply sits quietly in the regulator\u2019s files.\n\nFor example: duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use, which is usually given as an antidepressant. During a trial on its use for a completely different purpose \u2013 treating incontinence \u2013 there were apparently several suicides.70 This is important and interesting information, and the FDA holds the relevant data: it conducted a review on this issue, and came to a view on whether the risk was significant. But you cannot see any of that on the FDA website, because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence.71 The trial data was only used by the FDA to inform its internal ruminations. This is an everyday situation.\n\nBut even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators, getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky. The search functions on the FDA website are essentially broken, while the content is haphazard and badly organised, with lots missing, and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design. Once again \u2013 partly, here, through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence \u2013 it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need. Drug companies and regulators deny this: they say that if you search their websites, everything is there. So let\u2019s walk, briefly, through the process in all its infuriating glory. The case I will use was published three years ago in JAMA as a useful illustration of how broken the FDA site has become:72 replicating it today, in 2012, nothing has changed.\n\nSo: let\u2019s say we want to find the results from all the trials the FDA has, on a drug called pregabalin, in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease (a condition called \u2018diabetic peripheral neuropathy\u2019). You want the FDA review on this specific use, which is the PDF document containing all the trials in one big bundle. But if you search for \u2018pregabalin review\u2019, say, on the FDA website, you get over a hundred documents: none of them is clearly named, and not one of them is the FDA review document on pregabalin. If you type in the FDA application number \u2013 the unique identifier for the FDA document you\u2019re looking for \u2013 the FDA website comes up with nothing at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, or wise, you\u2019ll get dropped at the Drugs@FDA page: typing \u2018pregabalin\u2019 there brings up three \u2018FDA applications\u2019. Why three? Because there are three different documents, each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat. The FDA site doesn\u2019t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for, so you have to use trial and error to try to find out. That\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. I have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me: it\u2019s almost four hundred pages long, but it doesn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here. There\u2019s no executive summary at the beginning \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s no title page, no contents page, no hint of what the document is even about, and it skips randomly from one sub-document to another, all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file.\n\nIf you\u2019re a nerd, you might think: these files are electronic; they\u2019re PDFs, a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient. Any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document, it\u2019s easy: you just use the \u2018find\u2019 command: type in, say, \u2018peripheral neuropathy\u2019, and your computer will find the phrase straight off. But no: unlike almost any other serious government document in the world, the PDFs from the FDA are a series of photographs of pages of text, rather than the text itself. This means you cannot search for a phrase. Instead, you have to go through it, searching for that phrase, laboriously, by eye.\n\nI could go on. I will. There\u2019s some kind of \u2018table of contents\u2019 on the seventeenth page, but it gets the page numbers wrong. I\u2019ve finished now. There is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos. These problems aren\u2019t caused by technical issues specific to trials, and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix. This is plainly, simply, unhelpful, and the best we can hope is that it\u2019s driven by thoughtlessness.\n\nThat\u2019s a tragedy, because if you can unearth this document, and decode it, you will find that it is full of terrifying gems: perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study, in such a way that it is predestined \u2013 from the outset \u2013 to exaggerate the benefits of the drug.\n\nFor example, in the five trials on pregabalin and pain, lots of people dropped out during the study period. This is common in medical trials, as you will shortly see, and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful, or have had bad side effects. During these trials you\u2019re measuring pain at regular intervals. But if some people drop out, you\u2019re left with an important question: what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results? We know, after all, that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug.\n\nPfizer decided to use a method called \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, which means what you\u2019d expect: you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug, from just before they dropped out, and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed, after they stopped coming to follow-up appointments.\n\nThe FDA disapproved of this: it pointed out, quite correctly, that Pfizer\u2019s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is. For a fairer picture, we have to assume that the drop-outs stopped taking the drug because of side effects, so their pain score should reflect the reality, which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use. The correct level of pain to record for them is, therefore, their pain at the beginning of the study, before they had any kind of treatment (if you\u2019re interested, this is called \u2018Baseline Observation Carried Forward\u2019). The analysis was duly redone, properly, and a more modest, more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced. In this case, it turns out that using the \u2018last observation\u2019 method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. Four out of five of these trials were then published in the peer-reviewed academic literature, the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not (one trial wasn\u2019t published at all). Every single one of the published analyses used \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, the dodgy method, the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug. Not one of them acknowledges that \u2018last observation\u2019 is a technique that overstates these benefits.\n\nYou can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial: not only are some whole trials withheld from us, but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used. The devil is in the detail, and there are many dodgy trials, as we shall soon see, with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers, let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators. Furthermore, as we shall also see very shortly, there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators\u2019 summary documents and what actually happened in the trial.\n\nThis is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial: something called the Clinical Study Report (CSR). These are long pieces of work, sometimes thousands of pages, but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants; and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried. Drug companies give this study report to the regulator \u2013 though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug \u2013 so both have a copy, and both should be happy to hand it over.\n\nWe will now see what happens when you ask them.\n\nThree: Regulators withhold study reports that they do have\n\nIn 2007, researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs, orlistat and rimonabant. A systematic review, as you know, is the gold-standard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective. These are life-saving, because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment, including its side effects. But doing this requires access to all of the evidence: if some is missing, especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain, we will be left with a distorted picture.\n\nThe researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete, because negative trials are routinely left unpublished. But they also knew that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would have much of this information, since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market. Since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients, they applied to the EMA for the protocols and the study reports. That was in June 2007.\n\nIn August, the EMA responded: it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials, and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies. The researchers replied immediately, almost by return of post: there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone\u2019s commercial interests, they explained. But if there was, could the EMA please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients?\n\nWe should pause for just one moment, and think about what the EMA is doing here. It is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of Europe, with the aim of protecting the public. Doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data. The EMA has that data, but has decided that the drug companies\u2019 interests are more important. Having spoken to a lot of people in regulation, I can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking. Regulators, in my experience, are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data, and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market, and that this is enough: doctors and patients don\u2019t need to see the data, because the regulator has done all that work.\n\nThis misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors. Contrary to what some regulators seem to think, a drug is not either \u2018good\u2019 and therefore on the market, or \u2018bad\u2019 and therefore off it. A regulator makes a decision about whether it\u2019s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use, at all, ever \u2013 even if only in some very obscure circumstance, infrequently and cautiously. This bar is set pretty low, as we shall see, and lots of drugs that are on the market (in fact, the overwhelming majority) are hardly ever used.\n\nA doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision: is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now? The simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s particularly good, or the best. In fact, there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best. Maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug, so you want to try another, from a different class of drugs; maybe the patient has mild kidney failure, so you don\u2019t want to use the most popular drug, as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys; maybe you need a drug that won\u2019t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking.\n\nThese complex considerations are the reason we are OK with having a range of drugs on the market: even if some of them are less useful overall, they might be useful in specific circumstances. But we need to be able to see all of the information about them, in order to make these decisions. It is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug, and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it. Doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do.\n\nIn September 2007 the EMA confirmed to the Cochrane researchers that it wasn\u2019t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant, and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation. A serious problem had emerged. These weight-loss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout Europe, but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked, how bad the side effects were, which was more effective, or any of a whole host of other important questions. Real patients were being exposed to potential harm, in everyday prescribing decisions, through this lack of information that was enforced by the EMA.\n\nThe researchers went to the European Ombudsman with two clear allegations. Firstly, the EMA had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data; and secondly, the EMA\u2019s brief, dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified, because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results, other than the data on safety and effectiveness, which doctors and patients obviously need to access. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the EMA, and would last more than three years.\n\nIt took four months for the EMA to respond, and over the next year it simply reiterated its position: as far as it was concerned, any kind of information the disclosure of which would \u2018unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies\u2019 was commercially confidential. The study reports, it said, might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug. The researchers responded that this was unlikely, but was in any case of marginal importance, as part of a much more important and pressing situation: \u2018As a likely consequence of [the] EMA\u2019s position, patients would die unnecessarily, and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs.\u2019 They regarded the EMA\u2019s position as ethically indefensible. More than that, they said, the EMA had a clear conflict of interest: this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments. The EMA had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone\u2019s reasonable commercial interests, and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients.\n\nThen, almost two years into this process, the EMA changed tack. Suddenly, it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients. This argument hadn\u2019t been raised by the EMA before, but it\u2019s also not true. There may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants\u2019 odd presentations, or on possible side effects, but these were all in the same appendix, and could easily be removed.\n\nThe EU Ombudsman\u2019s conclusions were clear: the EMA had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information. He made a preliminary finding of maladministration. After doing that, he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the EMA, but he decided to do so anyway. His report is damning. The EMA had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest, and exposed patients to harm. The Ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself, and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information, nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs. The EMA\u2019s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue, and it had overestimated the work this would have involved: specifically, he explained, removing any personal data, where it did sometimes appear, would be easy.\n\nThe Ombudsman told the EMA to hand over the data, or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn\u2019t. Amazingly, the EMA, the drugs regulator covering the whole of Europe, still refused to hand over the documents. During this delay, people certainly suffered unnecessarily, and some possibly also died, simply for want of information. But the behaviour of the EMA then deteriorated even further, into the outright surreal. Any scrap of the company\u2019s thinking about how to run the trial, it argued, which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols, was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans. This was true, the EMA said, even though the drugs were already on the market, and the information was from final clinical trials, at the very end of the commercial drug-development process. The researchers responded that this was perverse: they knew that withheld data is often negative, so if anything, any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market, if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the end of it. The EMA also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk, stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this. To me this is \u2013 if you can forgive me \u2013 a slightly contemptuous attitude, especially given what happens in the next paragraph. It\u2019s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment, then they will make worse decisions, exposing patients to unnecessary harm. Furthermore, it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket \u2018yes or no\u2019 edict and summary from a regulator. This is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant, but it\u2019s also true of any drug, and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed.\n\nThen, in 2009, one of the two drugs, rimonabant, was taken off the market, on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide. This, at the same time that the EMA was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients.\n\nAnd then the EMA suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information.\n\nIn case it needs reiterating, let me remind you that the first trial appears in the Bible, Daniel 1:12, and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time, all trials are essentially identical experiments, generic across any field, with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago. There is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property.\n\nThis was now a farce. The researchers opened all barrels. The EMA was in breach of the Declaration of Helsinki, the international code of medical ethics, which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public. The researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data, and so did the EMA. Patients would die if the EMA continued to withhold data. There was nothing of serious commercial value in there. The EMA\u2019s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate. The EMA was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain.\n\nIt was now August 2009, and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs, from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public. They weren\u2019t alone. The French \u2018prescribers\u2019 bulletin\u2019 Prescrire was trying at the same time to get the EMA\u2019s documents on rimonabant. It was sent some unhelpful documents, including the rather remarkable \u2018Final Assessment Report\u2019, from the Swedish agency that had handled the drug\u2019s approval much earlier. You can read this PDF in full online. Or rather, you can\u2019t. On the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like \u2013 the document the EMA sent to one of France\u2019s most respected journals for doctors.73 I think it tells a rather clear story, and to add to the insult, there are sixty pages of this in total.\n\nIn the meantime, the Danish Medical Authority had handed over fifty-six study reports to Cochrane (though it still needed more from the EMA); a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the Danish government, which had seen no problem with commercial information (there was none), nor administrative hassle (it was minimal), nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information (which is laughable). This was chaos. The EMA \u2013 which you may remember was responsible for EudraCT, the transparency tool that is held in secret \u2013 was going out on a very peculiar limb. It seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients. As we shall see, sadly, this level of secrecy is its stock in trade.\n\nBut now we come to the end of this particular road for the EMA. It handed the full, final study reports over to the Ombudsman, reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial. Once he had had these documents in his hand, his final opinion came swiftly. There was no commercial data here. There was no confidential patient information here. Hand it over to the public, now. The EMA, at glacial pace, agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers, doctors and patients who needed it. The Ombudsman\u2019s final ruling was published at the end of November 2010.74 The initial complaint was made in June 2007. That is a full three and a half years of fighting, obstruction and spurious arguments from the EMA, during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients.\n\nAfter this precedent had been set, things had to shift at the EMA; it was forced to revise its approach, and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy (this window has just been shut down, in 2013, as you will read in the Afterword). But even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial: the EMA often doesn\u2019t hold all the modules, of all the reports, for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved. And it only holds records for the most recent few years, which is hopelessly incomplete, since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades. In fact, this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the Cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the Ombudsman. They applied for documents on antidepressants: a good place to start, since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years (though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine). What happened next was even more bizarre than the EMA\u2019s three-year battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant.\n\nThe researchers put in their request to the EMA, but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries, rather than by the EMA centrally. These local authorisations were then \u2018copied\u2019 to all other nations. The MHRA, the UK drugs regulator, held the information the researchers wanted, so they would have to approach it for a copy. The researchers dutifully wrote to the MHRA, asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine, and then waited patiently. Finally the answer came: the MHRA explained that it would be happy to hand over this information, but there was a problem.\n\nThe documents had all been shredded.75\n\nThis was in keeping, it explained, with the agency\u2019s retention policy, which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific, historical or political interest, and the files didn\u2019t meet those criteria. Let\u2019s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be. The SSRI antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data, and that should be enough on its own, but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter, one of them \u2013 paroxetine \u2013 was involved in an unprecedented, four-year-long investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against GSK. That investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the MHRA has ever conducted into drug safety: in fact, it was the largest investigation the MHRA has ever conducted, of any kind, ever. Quite apart from that, these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy. But the MHRA shredded them all the same, feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific, historical or political interest.76\n\nI can only leave you there.\n\nWhere are we so far?\n\nThe missing data saga is long and complex, and involves patients around the world being put at risk, and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent. Since we are almost at the end of it, this is a good moment to gather together what we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nTrials are frequently conducted, but then left unpublished, and so are unavailable to doctors and patients. Only half of all trials get published, and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones. This means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give. Since there is no way to compensate for this missing data, we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe.\n\nThis is research misconduct on a grand, international scale. The reality of the problem is universally recognised, but nobody has bothered to fix it:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Ethics committees allow companies and individual \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trials on human participants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*University administrators and ethics committees permit \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0control the data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Registers have never been enforced.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Academic journals continue to publish trials that were \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unregistered, despite pretending that they won\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Regulators have information that would be vital to improve \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patient care, but are systematically obstructive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information that they do have;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don\u2019t \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0see.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Governments have never implemented laws compelling \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0companies to publish data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Doctors\u2019 and academics\u2019 professional bodies have done nothing.\n\nWhat to do about all this?\n\nYou will need to wait, because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come.\n\nTrying to get trial data from drug companies: the story of Tamiflu\n\nGovernments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called Tamiflu. In the UK alone we have spent several hundred million pounds \u2013 the total figure is not yet clear \u2013 and so far we\u2019ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs. I\u2019m very sorry if you have the flu, because it\u2019s horrid being ill; but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours (though Tamiflu does do this, fairly satisfactorily). We have spent this money to reduce the rate of \u2018complications\u2019: a medical euphemism, meaning pneumonia and death.\n\nLots of people seem to think Tamiflu will do this. The US Department of Health and Human Services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions. The European Medicines Agency said it would reduce complications. The Australian drugs regulator said so too. Roche\u2019s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent.77 But what is the evidence that Tamiflu really will reduce complications? Answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the Cochrane Collaboration, which you will remember is the vast and independent non-profit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year. In 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic, and an enormous amount of money was being spent on Tamiflu. Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group to update its earlier reviews on the drug.\n\nCochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications. But then a Japanese paediatrician called Keiji Hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. This wasn\u2019t in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted underneath the Tamiflu review on the Cochrane website.\n\nYou\u2019ve summarised the data from all the trials, he explained, but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite, an industry-funded meta-analysis led by an author called Kaiser. This, \u2018the Kaiser paper\u2019, summarises the findings of ten earlier trials, but from these ten trials, only two have ever been published in the scientific literature. For the remaining eight, your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary, industry source. That\u2019s not reliable enough.\n\nIn case it\u2019s not immediately obvious, this is science at its best. The Cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. Cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. And, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. Tom Jefferson is an editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. He realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the Kaiser data. He said so, without any defensiveness, and then set about getting the information in a straight, workpersonlike fashion. This began a three-year battle, which is still not resolved, but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible.\n\nFirst, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper, asking for more information. In reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files, and that they should contact Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu. So naturally they wrote to Roche and asked for the data.\n\nThis is where the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some data, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was an impossibility for any serious scientist: it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency. More than this, the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues, in that it would have required the Cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader: it included a clause saying that on signing it, the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement; and more than that, they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed. Roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about trial data, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Jefferson asked for clarification, and never received a reply.\n\nThen, in October 2009, the company changed tack: they would like to hand the data over, they explained, but another meta-analysis was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given them the study reports, so Cochrane couldn\u2019t have them. This was a simple non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups shouldn\u2019t all work on the same question. In fact, quite the opposite: replication is the cornerstone of good science. Roche\u2019s excuse made no sense. Jefferson asked for clarification, but never received a reply.\n\nOne week later, unannounced, Roche sent seven short documents, each around a dozen pages long. These contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the Kaiser meta-analysis. This was a start, but it didn\u2019t contain anything like enough information for Cochrane to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials.\n\nAt the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. Firstly, there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations. The FDA said there were no benefits on complications, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in charge of public health in the USA \u2013 some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks) said it did reduce complications. The Japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the EMA said there was a benefit. In a sensible world, we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet, because all would have access to the same information. Of course, there is also room for occasional, reasonable disagreement, especially where there are close calls: this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug, so that they can make their own judgements.\n\nMeanwhile, reflecting these different judgements, Roche\u2019s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions, depending on what the local regulator had said. It\u2019s na\u00efve, perhaps, to expect consistency from a drug company, but from this and other stories it\u2019s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory, rather than any consistent review of the evidence.\n\nIn any case, now that their interest had been piqued, the Cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases. Roche\u2019s global safety database held 2,466 neuropsychiatric adverse events, of which 562 were classified as \u2018serious\u2019. But the FDA database for the same period held only 1,805 adverse events in total. The rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom, and where, but even allowing for that, this was odd.\n\nIn any case, since Roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review, the Cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished Kaiser data from their analysis, because the details could not be verified in the normal way. People cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren\u2019t clear: the devil is often in the detail, as we shall see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment.\n\nThis is particularly important with Tamiflu, because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal, and that published accounts were incomplete, to say the least. On closer examination, for example, the patients participating were clearly unusual, to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients. In the published accounts, patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients, suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough, fatigue, and so on. We don\u2019t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice, but when these tests are done \u2013 for surveillance purposes \u2013 then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with \u2018flu\u2019 will actually be infected with the influenza virus, and most of the year only one in eight will really have it. (The rest are sick from something else, maybe just a common cold virus.)\n\nTwo thirds of the trial participants summarised in the Kaiser paper tested positive for flu. This is bizarrely high, and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated, because it is being tested on perfect patients, the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus. In normal practice, which is where the results of these trials will be applied, doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with \u2018flu-like illness\u2019, which is all you can realistically do in a clinic. Among these real patients, many will not actually have the influenza virus. This means that in the real world, the benefits of Tamiflu on flu will be diluted, and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don\u2019t actually have flu virus in their systems. This, in turn, means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance, in comparison with any benefits. That is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal, everyday, realistic patients: if they are not, their findings may not be relevant to the real world.\n\nSo the Cochrane review was published without the Kaiser data in December 2009, alongside some explanatory material about why the Kaiser results had been excluded, and a small flurry of activity followed. Roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online, and committed to make full study reports available (it still hasn\u2019t done so).\n\nWhat Roche posted was incomplete, but it began a journey for the Cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial, and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief, published academic papers. At the core of every trial is the raw data: every single record of blood pressure of every patient, the doctors\u2019 notes describing any unusual symptoms, investigators\u2019 notes, and so on. A published academic paper is a short description of the study, usually following a set format: an introductory background; a description of the methods; a summary of the important results; and then finally a discussion, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design, and the implications of the results for clinical practice.\n\nA clinical study report, or CSR, is the intermediate document that stands between these two, and can be very long, sometimes thousands of pages.78 Anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents, but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them. They contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on.\n\nThese documents are split into different sections, or \u2018modules\u2019. Roche has shared only \u2018module 1\u2019, for only seven of the ten study reports Cochrane has requested. These modules are missing vitally important information, including the analysis plan, the randomisation details, the study protocol (and the list of deviations from that), and so on. But even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial.\n\nFor example, looking at the two papers out of ten in the Kaiser review which were published, one says: \u2018There were no drug-related serious adverse events,\u2019 and the other doesn\u2019t mention adverse events. But in the \u2018module 1\u2019 documents on these same two studies, there are ten serious adverse events listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to Tamiflu.79\n\nAnother published paper describes itself as a trial comparing Tamiflu against placebo. A placebo is an inert tablet, containing no active ingredient, that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine. But the CSR for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule, whereas the placebos were grey and ivory. The \u2018placebo\u2019 tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid, a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty.80 Nobody has any clear idea of why, and it\u2019s not even mentioned in the academic paper; but it seems that this was not actually an inert, dummy pill placebo.\n\nSimply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject; but in the case of Tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible. For example, Roche Shanghai informed the Cochrane group of one large trial (ML16369), but Roche Basel seemed not to know of its existence. But by setting out all the trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest \u2018phase 3\u2019 trial \u2013 one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market \u2013 was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents.fn3\n\nThere were other odd discrepancies. Why, for example, was one trial on Tamiflu published in 2010, ten years after it was completed?82 Why did some trials report completely different authors, depending on where they were being discussed?83 And so on.\n\nThe chase continued. In December 2009 Roche had promised: \u2018full study reports will also be made available on a password-protected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses\u2019. This never happened. Then an odd game began. In June 2010 Roche said: Oh, we\u2019re sorry, we thought you had what you wanted. In July it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality (you may remember this from the EMA saga). This was an odd move: for most of the important parts of these documents, privacy is no issue at all. The full trial protocol, and the analysis plan, are both completed before any single patient is ever touched. Roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports. It simply continued to withhold them.\n\nThen in August 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands, betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions. Firstly, it insisted on seeing the Cochrane reviewers\u2019 full analysis plan. Fine, they said, and posted the whole protocol online. Doing so is completely standard practice at Cochrane, as it should be for any transparent organisation, and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin. There were few surprises, since all Cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway. Roche continued to withhold its study reports (including, ironically, its own protocols, the very thing it demanded Cochrane should publish, and that Cochrane had published, happily).\n\nBy now Roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. Suddenly, the company began to raise odd personal concerns. It claimed that some Cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. \u2018Certain members of Cochrane Group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors,\u2019 it announced, \u2018are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.\u2019 This is an astonishing state of affairs, where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all; but still Roche refused to hand over the study reports.\n\nThen it complained that the Cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to Roche staff. I was one of the people copied in on these interactions, and I believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do. Roche\u2019s excuses had become perverse, and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports. It\u2019s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on Roche\u2019s refusal to release the data, and this is an important matter of public health, both for the individual case of this Tamiflu data, and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information.\n\nThen things became even more perverse. In January 2011 Roche announced that the Cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need. This was simply untrue. In February it insisted that all the studies requested were published (meaning academic papers, now shown to be misleading on Tamiflu). Then it declared that it would hand over nothing more, saying: \u2018You have all the detail you need to undertake a review.\u2019 But this still wasn\u2019t true: it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over \u2018within a few days\u2019 in December 2009, a year and a half earlier.\n\nAt the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen: it\u2019s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk, it said, not academics. Now, this claim fails on two important fronts. Firstly, as with many other drugs, we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data. In January 2012 Roche claimed that it \u2018has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process\u2019. But the EMA never received this information for at least fifteen trials. This was because the EMA had never requested it.\n\nAnd that brings us on to our final important realisation: regulators are not infallible. They make outright mistakes, and they make decisions which are open to judgement, and should be subject to second-guessing and checking by many eyes around the world. In the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail, behind closed doors, but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of \u2018many eyes\u2019 perfectly.\n\nRosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug, and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective.84 Diabetes is common, and more people develop the disease every year. Sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar, and diabetes drugs, alongside dietary changes, are supposed to fix this. Although it\u2019s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home, we don\u2019t control these figures for their own sake: we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of real-world outcomes, like heart attack and death, both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes.\n\nRosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999, and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour. In that first year, Dr John Buse from the University of North Carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings. The drug\u2019s manufacturer, GSK, made direct contact in an attempt to silence him, then moved on to his head of department. Buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents. To cut a long story short, after wading through documents for several months, in 2007 the US Senate Committee on Finance released a report describing the treatment of Dr Buse as \u2018intimidation\u2019.\n\nBut we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data. In 2003 the Uppsala Drug Monitoring Group of the World Health Organization contacted GSK about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems. GSK conducted two internal meta-analyses of its own data on this, in 2005 and 2006. These showed that the risk was real, but although both GSK and the FDA had these results, neither made any public statement about them, and they were not published until 2008.\n\nDuring this delay, vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug, but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007, when cardiologist Professor Steve Nissen and colleagues published a landmark meta-analysis. This showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone. Since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems, and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk, that finding was big potatoes. His findings were confirmed in later work, and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted, all around the world.\n\nNow, my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner, because as perverse as it sounds, doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort. For example, a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills, and be unable to take them any longer. Once this has happened, it may be worth trying a less effective drug, if it is at least better than nothing.\n\nThe concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors, visible only to regulators. In fact, Nissen\u2019s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement. In 2004, when GSK was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children, the UK conducted an unprecedented four-year-long investigation, as we saw earlier. But in the US, the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud, the settlement of which, alongside a significant payout, required GSK to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website.\n\nProfessor Nissen used the rosiglitazone data, when it became available, found worrying signs of harm, and published this to doctors, which is something that the regulators had never done, despite having the information years earlier. (Though before doctors got to read it, Nissen by chance caught GSK discussing a copy of his unpublished paper, which it had obtained improperly.85)\n\nIf this information had all been freely available from the start, regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions, but crucially, doctors and patients could have disagreed with them, and made informed choices. This is why we need wider access to full CSRs, and all trial reports, for all medicines, and this is why it is perverse that Roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on Tamiflu.\n\nAstonishingly, a paper published in April 2012 by regulators from the UK and Europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing, to a limited extent, within limits, for some studies, with caveats, at the appropriate juncture, and in the fullness of time.86 Before feeling any sense of enthusiasm, we should remember that this is a cautious utterance, wrung out after the dismal fights I have already described; that it has not been implemented; that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data; and that in any case, regulators do not have all the trial data anyway. But it is an interesting start.\n\nTheir two main objections \u2013 if we accept their goodwill at face value \u2013 are interesting, because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data. Firstly, they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data: to this, again, I say, \u2018Let them,\u2019 because these foolish analyses should be conducted, and then rubbished, in public.\n\nWhen UK hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public, doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged: the crude figures can be misinterpreted, after all, because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence, and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours; and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway, so some hospitals might look unusually good, or bad, simply through the play of chance. Initially, to an extent, these fears were realised: there were a few shrill, unfair stories, and people overinterpreted the results. Now, for the most part, things have settled down, and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading. For drug data, where there is so much danger from withheld information, and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses, and so many other academics happy to criticise them, releasing the data is the only healthy option.\n\nBut secondly, the EMA raises the spectre of patient confidentiality, and hidden in this concern is one final prize.\n\nSo far I have been talking about access to trial reports, summaries of patients\u2019 outcomes in trials. There is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality, and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable \u2013 a lengthy medical description of one person\u2019s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial, perhaps \u2013 these can easily be removed, since they appear in a separate part of the document. These CSRs should undoubtedly, without question, be publicly available documents, and this should be enforced retrospectively, going back decades, to the dawn of trials.\n\nBut all trials are ultimately run on individual patients, and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study. While I would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website \u2013 it would be easy for patients to be identifiable, from many small features of their histories \u2013 it is surprising that patient-level data is almost never shared with academics.\n\nSharing data of individual patients\u2019 outcomes in clinical trials, rather than just the final summary result, has several significant advantages. Firstly, it\u2019s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices. In the VIGOR trial on the painkiller Vioxx, for example, a bizarre reporting decision was made.87 The aim of the study was to compare Vioxx against an older, cheaper painkiller, to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems (this was the hope for Vioxx), and also if it caused more heart attacks (this was the fear). But the date cut-off for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems. This had the result of making the risks look less significant, relative to the benefits, but it was not declared clearly in the paper, resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed. If the raw data on patients was shared, games like these would be far easier to spot, and people might be less likely to play them in the first place.\n\nOccasionally \u2013 with vanishing rarity \u2013 researchers are able to obtain raw data, and re-analyse studies that have already been conducted and published. Daniel Coyne, Professor of Medicine at Washington University, was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin, a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis, after a four-year-long fight.88 The original academic publication on this study, ten years earlier, had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol (we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments), and changed the main statistical analysis strategy (again, a huge source of bias). Coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol; and when he did, he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug. It was a peculiar outcome, as he himself acknowledges: \u2018As strange as it seems, I am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients, and I didn\u2019t even participate in the trial.\u2019 There is room, in my view, for a small army of people doing the very same thing, reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed, in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols.\n\nData sharing would also confer other benefits. It allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data, and to better investigate \u2013 for example \u2013 whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect. It would also allow cautious \u2018subgroup analyses\u2019, to see if a drug is particularly useful, or particularly useless, in particular types of patients.\n\nThe biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a meta-analysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper. Let\u2019s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug, and another reports survival at seven years. To combine these two in a meta-analysis, you\u2019d have a problem. But if you were doing the meta-analysis with access to individual patient data, with treatment details and death dates for all of them, you could do a clean combined calculation for three-year survival.\n\nDarby S, McGale P, Correa C, Taylor C, Arriagada R, Clarke M, Cutter D, Davies C, Ewertz M, Godwin J, Gray R, Pierce L, Whelan T, Wang Y, Peto R.Albain K, Anderson S, Arriagada R, Barlow

to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration. The summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration, between vast numbers of people, and on vast numbers of patients, producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nThe process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale. Here, for example, is the author list on an academic paper from the Lancet in November 2011: it\u2019s reporting an immense, definitive, and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes, using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials. The author list is printed in four-point font size (though I suspect that might go wrong in the e-book edition \u2026) because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it. I typed each of them in by hand for you.\n\nThis is what medicine should look like. An honest list of all the people involved, free access to information, and all the data pooled together, giving the most accurate information we can manage, to inform real decisions, and so prevent avoidable suffering and death.\n\nWe are a very, very long way away from there.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nWe urgently need to improve access to trial data. In addition to the previous suggestions, there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information, and so improve patient care.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The results of all trials conducted on humans must be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0made available within one year of completion, in summary \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0table form if academic journal publication has not occurred. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This requires the creation of a body that is charged with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0twelve months; and primary legislation that is enforced, as a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0matter of urgency, internationally, with stiff penalties for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transgression. In my view these penalties should include fines, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but also prison terms for those who are found to be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0responsible for withholding trial data, as patients are harmed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by this process.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.All systematic reviews \u2013 such as Cochrane reviews \u2013 that draw \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0together trial results on any clinical question should also \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0include a section on the trials which they know have been \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0conducted, but whose results are being withheld. This should \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0state: which completed trials have not reported results; how \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0many patients\u2019 worth of information there is in each unreported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trial; the names of the organisations and the individuals who \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are withholding the data; the efforts the reviewers have made \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to get the information from them. This is trivial extra work, as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0review teams already attempt to access this kind of data. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Documenting this will draw attention to the problem, and make \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for harming patient care in each area of medicine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All clinical study reports should also be made publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available, for all the trials that have ever been conducted on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0humans. This will be cheap, as the only costs are in finding one \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paper copy, scanning it and placing it online, perhaps with a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0check to remove confidential patient information. There is a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0being withheld, distorting what we know about treatments in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0widespread current use. Many of these documents will be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulators. We need legislation compelling the industry to hand \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them over. Our failure to fix this is costing lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0We need to work on new methods for academics to extract \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0summary information from these documents, as they are more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0detailed than published academic papers. The Cochrane group \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working on Tamiflu have made great progress here, learning as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0they go, and this field will need manuals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.\u00a0We should work towards all triallists having an obligation to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0share patient-level data wherever possible, with convenient \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0online data warehouses,89 and streamlined systems \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access, in order to conduct pooled analyses and double-check \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results reported in published trials.\n\nNone of this is difficult, or impossible. Some of it is technical, for which I apologise. The field of missing data is a tragic and strange one.

FBI agents Subaru Okiya, Jodie Starling and Andre Camel discuss the latest updates about the Black Organization.\n\nJODIE STARLING: And? Why did you have us check if anyone was following us and come here? Surely you didn't just want to show us your improved talent for disguises.\n\nSUBARU OKIYA: No. This morning I received a message from Kir. Mizunashi Rena.\n\nANDRE CAMEL & JODIE: Yes?\n\nANDRE: Then they don't know you're alive.\n\nSUBARU: Probably not.\n\nSubaru takes his phone out.\n\nSUBARU: But her message contained only three letters.\n\nJODIE: Three letters?\n\nANDRE: Was it an abbreviation?\n\nSUBARU: No. It's the name of a liquor you're very familiar with. R-U-M. Rum. Subaru holds his phone up for everyone. One of their code names.\n\nJodie and Andre are startled.\n\nJODIE: Rum?\n\nSUBARU: When I was in the Organization, I heard the name a couple of times. It seems he's their boss's close adviser.\n\nANDRE: A-A close adviser?\n\nJODIE: But we haven't heard anything about that.\n\nCUT TO: Teitan Elementary School\n\nSUBARU: (On Conan's radio transmitter) Since she sent only one word, it was probably an urgent message. She couldn't afford to tell you. In any case, tell James someone big is on the move. Someone bigger than Gin.\n\nCUT TO: Opening Credits\n\nCONAN EDOGAWA: (Narrating) Three First Discoverers: Part One!\n\nCUT TO: Walkway\n\nMITSUHIKO TSUBURAYA: By the way, did you see yesterday's Tokyo Derby?\n\nGENTA KOJIMA: The Spirits versus Noirs match, right?\n\nAYUMI YOSHIDA: I did! Hide got a hat trick, right?\n\nMITSUHIKO: That's right! It's no wonder he's their star player!\n\nAI HAIBARA: Rum? \"Datcha\"?\n\nLUM INVADER: Darling...\n\nCONAN: Not the comic character, the liquor. You know, the stuff pirates drink.\n\nAI: I have no idea what you mean. I told you before. I don't know much about the liquor.\n\nCONAN: R-Right... (Thinking) To get information on Rum, close adviser to the Black Organization's boss, we'll need to wait to hear from Mizunashi Rena-san, who's infiltrated the Organization, or ask undercover public safety officer Amuro-san...\n\nAI: But, I know the Organization's number two code name is Rum.\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) Number two?!\n\nAI: At the very least, that's what I heard while I was there. I never met them, though.\n\nCONAN: Wh-What were they like? Are they a man or a woman?\n\nAI: I said I never met them. While I was in the Organization, I heard all kinds of descriptions. A large brawny man. An effeminate man. An old man. Some people claimed they were all his doubles.\n\nCONAN: \"A large brawny man, an effeminate man, and an old man\"..\n\nAI: Hey! Don't tell me Rum's searching for me.\n\nCONAN: N-No.. The Organization uses types of liquors for all its code names, right? I was just wondering if there was someone named \"Rum\"..\n\nGENTA: What about Rum?\n\nAI & CONAN: What?\n\nGENTA: You were just talking about it.\n\nMITSUHIKO: That Rum is looking for someone.\n\nAYUMI: Tell me. I'm curious.\n\nCONAN: What? Uh- Rum.. Rum.. Ramune!\n\nGENTA, MITSUHIKO & AYUMI: Ramune?!\n\nCONAN: I bet you're thirsty after playing soccer in the park. So I was looking to see if the shop over there was selling ramune.\n\nMITSUHIKO: Ah, you mean the drink?\n\nGENTA: Normal juice is fine.\n\nCONAN: Y-Yeah..\n\nAYUMI: Huh? That kid is still there.\n\nAI: What kid?\n\nAYUMI: Look. The boy standing in the other street. He was standing there on our way to the park. He was staring into the distance then, too.\n\nMITSUHIKO: What is he looking at?\n\nGENTA: Maybe someone's about to fall from a high place.\n\nCONAN: Let's ask him.\n\nEVERYONE: Yes!\n\nEveryone runs across the alleyway to question the kid.\n\nCONAN: (He's looking at an apartment?) Hey, you. What are you..?\n\nTHE KID: (Cries) The lady.. They killed the lady!\n\nEVERYONE: Yes?!\n\nCONAN: Did you see someone kill her?\n\nTHE KID: No, but she told me. Three men were going to visit the lady's apartment. If she doesn't come out after they leave, she's probably been killed, so I should call the police.\n\nAI: So the woman..\n\nTHE KID: She's not coming out! It's been about thirty minutes since the third man left.\n\nMITSUHIKO: Did you call the police?\n\nTHE KID: Not yet. I'm too scared.\n\nCONAN: Do you remember what the three men looked like?\n\nTHE KID: Y-Yeah.. There was a really big man, a young guy with a hair like a girl, and an old man with white hair.\n\nCONAN: (Shocked. Thinking) What?\n\nAI: (Narrating) \"A large brawny man. An effeminate man. An old man.\"\n\nCONAN: (Whispering) Hey! Do you think..?!\n\nAI: It's too much of a coincidence. But Rum always had a special trait. The description of his appearance were varied, but the trait was always the same. I can't remember what it was..\n\nCONAN: In any case, show us to the woman's room. It's that apartment, right?\n\nTHE KID: Okay.\n\nConan runs to the apartment. Others follow him. They walk upstairs.\n\nMITSUHIKO: What's your relationship with the woman?\n\nGENTA: Is she a relative?\n\nTHE KID: No. I don't know her.\n\nEVERYONE: What?\n\nCONAN: She's a total stranger?\n\nTHE KID: Yeah. She'd talk to me when I was playing alone in the park. Since I moved here, I didn't have any friends.\n\nAYUMI: But your parents know about the lady, right?\n\nTHE KID: No. I don't have a dad nor mom.\n\nMITSUHIKO: Really?\n\nTHE KID: Yeah. While I was on a trip, they got involved in a \"robin murder.\"\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) A robbery and murder.\n\nTHE KID: I'm staying with my uncle, but he's too busy to play with me.\n\nAI: So after seeing how lonely you were, the woman decided to play with you.\n\nTHE KID: Yeah. I asked to come to her house to play before, but she wouldn't let me. But today she made an exception and invited me. She writes stories for TV shows.\n\nThe kid rings the doorbell.\n\nTHE KID: She told me all about the story she was going to write.\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) She's a scriptwriter?\n\nThe kid rings the doorbell again.\n\nTHE KID: Ma'am!\n\nThe kid rings the doorbell twice more.\n\nMITSUHIKO: There's no answer.\n\nGENTA: Excuse me.\n\nGenta grabs the door handle.\n\nGENTA: It's unlocked!\n\nTHE KID: You can't go in! She told me if she didn't come out, I should let the police handle it and stay outside!\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) Does that mean..? (Conan opens the door. A lady's corpse is hung on the ceiling.) I knew it.\n\nAyumi screams.\n\nTHE KID: Ma'am! Ma'am!\n\nCONAN: Don't come in! Haibara, call the police.\n\nAI: Got it.\n\nMITSUHIKO: Should we call an ambulance, too?\n\nCONAN: No, look around her feet. If this were really a suicide, there would be a stool or something by her feet. Since that's something, it means someone killed her and made this look like a suicide. It was probably one of the three men this kid saw. If it's about thirty minutes since the third man left, we're too late.\n\nMITSUHIKO: No..\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) That's odd, though. (Conan steps inside the room.) Even though he was panicked enough to forget the stool, there are no signs he left the room in a hurry. And I don't see the Yoshikawa lines left behind when a strangulation victim struggles. I'd understand if he struggled her to putting her into sleep. But who would plan that much and forget the stool? (Conan notices a white envelope.) An envelope? (He picks up the envelope. The envelope sender reads \"Tohto Bank.\") A bank envelope. It's new, too. Which means in the wallet on the desk.. There should be the money she withdrew. But there's barely anything in here. (Conan picks up the bank ATM paper.) All that's inside is the bank's ATM usage details. According to this, she withdrew 500,000 yen three hours ago. But the money's nowhere to be found. Which means he killed her for the money.\n\nAI: In any case, it's clear this sloppy crime wasn't their work.\n\nCONAN: Yeah.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: I see.. So you were watching this apartment at the woman's request, and after three men came and left, you came here to find her like this?\n\nTHE KID: Y-Yeah.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: The deceased is scriptwriter Komai Yasue-san.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes, sir.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: If this is murder, we'll have to find people among her associates, who may have resented her and call them in for a lineup with this kid.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: We have the names of the three people the victim was meeting here today.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Yes?\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: They're in the scheduling software installed in the computer on the desk. This afternoon she met Sakaba Ronbei, Habanaka Kuramichi, and Shibakaru Denji.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Really?\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes. It's written on the notebook in the drawer and calendar, so it's probably correct. Also, we can't find the 500,00 yen the victim withdrew from the bank today anywhere.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: So they killed her for the money, make it look like a suicide, and ran. Find out who they are and call the station.\n\nThe kid looks downstairs, scared.\n\nAYUMI: What's wrong?\n\nTHE KID: Th-They're here.. The three men who came to the woman's room are here!\n\nGENTA: S-Seriously?\n\nCONAN: Can you point them out while keeping your face hidden behind the railing?\n\nTHE KID: O-Okay.. Let's see..\n\nCONAN: Did you find them?\n\nTHE KID: Yeah.. The stocky man over there, that long-haired man to the side, and the old man behind him.\n\nCONAN: Inspector Megure! (He whispered into his ears.)\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Got it. Takagi-kun.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes, sir!\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Give me a break, officer. I just came to check out the incident in the neighborhood. Why am I being questioned?\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: We're just passers-by.\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Or do we look like wanted men?\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: No, a witness saw you visiting the victim's apartment between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, the presumed time of her death. The witness also said the victim Komai Yasue-san asked him to watch the apartment because one of the three men coming to visit may kill her.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Kill her? Isn't this a suicide?\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: A suicide?\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Normally a hanging is a suicide..\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: How do you know the victim hung herself?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Uh, well..\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: It seems I can't hide it. I am Shibakaru Denji.  We became drinking buddies after a chance meeting at a bar. This photo proves it. She said she was worried so I came to talk, but I had no idea it had driven her to suicide..\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: So she was already dead when you arrived?\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: Yes, so I have no idea what she was concerned about. If you want to know, try asking these two. Not that I know who these are.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Hey!.. I came to get the money she borrowed. We're old friends, so I lent her a bunch of money. But now I need that money, so I asked for it back.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Was the amount 500,000 yen?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: What? H-How did you know that?\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: (Thinking) So this is the man who took the money.\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Excuse me.. I'm actually a producer at TV Tohto. I hired Komai-san to write a script for this fall's special mystery program. She said the script was ready, so I came to pick it up.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Where was the script?\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: It was just at the door, so I took it and gave it to my AD.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Was she already hanging then?\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Yes.. I don't know what was worrying her, but the script was due, so I didn't have time to think about it.\n\nCONAN: Yeah, but.. wouldn't you normally call the police if you saw that? Why didn't you?\n\nAI: He's right. No matter what you had to do..\n\nGENTA: You'd call the cops..\n\nMITSUHIKO: Especially if you knew the victim..\n\nAYUMI: Why didn't you?\n\nCONAN: Surely you didn't have a reason you couldn't call the police.\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: N-No..\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Mind your own business, kid!\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Who is that boy in the glasses?\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: Mind your own business.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: They were the first ones to discover the body. Though it seems like you're the actual first discoverers. In any case, we'd like you separately, so come inside one at a time.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Oh. I've got an alibi!\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: An alibi?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: The money was supposed to be deposited by 2:00 PM, but when I checked the ATM, there was no money. So I came here to get it myself.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: I see.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: I got scared when I saw her dead body, so I rushed back to the ATM. I had to pay off my card today, so I was forced to use the money I had.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: How is that an alibi?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: ATMs have security cameras. If you compare the time between when I left and came back, with how long it takes to get from here to the bank and back, you'll know I didn't have time to kill her.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: That's not quite an alibi, but it will help the investigation.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Is the bank nearby?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Yeah, it's pretty close.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: I'll go with him to the bank to check.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Thanks.\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: Is is all right if I smoke while we wait? I've got a portable ashtray.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: Go ahead, but the wind's picked up. Don't scatter the ashes.\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: All right.\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) That's a huge flame.\n\nKuramichi Habanaka coughs by the smoke.\n\nDENJI SHIBAKARU: Sorry, did I get you with the smoke?\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: No, it's all right.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: (Whispering) You really don't know the order in which they came from?\n\nTHE KID: No. I know it's them, though.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: We'll need to question them more.\nI see. He was really on the ATM's security camera footage?\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: Yes.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: We can smoke? I'll have one, too.\n\nDetective Takagi walks up to Inspector Megure.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: (Whispering) But, sir, he was away from the ATM for forty minutes. It's hardly an alibi. It takes less than twenty minutes to get there and back.\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: (Whispering) Then why didn't he mention it?\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: (Whispering) He nearly escaped a few times. I think he may have been after that.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Damn it.\n\nKURAMICHI HABANAKA: Would you like to use mine?\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Thanks. Sheesh. You don't need to glare. I won't try to escape any more. It was just a joke. Oh- uh.. Sh-Shall we get these interviews over with?\n\nINSPECTOR MEGURE: All right. You're first.\n\nRONPEI SAKABA: Who, me?! Fine. Go easy on me.\n\nCONAN: (Thinking) I see.\n\nCUT TO: Ending Credits\n\nCUT TO: Episode Preview\n\nAI: Figure anything out?\n\nCONAN: Yeah. The person who caused this incident and the name of that kid.\n\nCONAN: Hey, Detective Takagi. I think you should search the room harder.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: What?\n\nCONAN: There's definitely 500,000 yen in there somewhere.\n\nDETECTIVE TAKAGI: What?\n\nCONAN: Also..

Mithraism and the Religions of the Empire by\u00a0Franz\u00a0Cumont", "The Mysteries Of Mithra - Mithraism and the Religions of the Empire Lyrics\n\nMITHRAISM AND THE RELIGIONS OF THE EMPIRE\n\nTHE acts of the Oriental martyrs bear eloquent testimony to the intolerance of the national clergy of the Persia of the Sassanids; and the Magi of the ancient empire, if they were not persecutors, at least constituted an exclusive caste, and possibly even a privileged race. The priests of Mithra afford no evidence of having assumed a like attitude. Like the Judaism of Alexandria, Mazdaism. had been softened in Asia Minor by the Hellenic civilization. Transported into a strange world, it was compelled to accommodate itself to the usages and ideas there prevailing; and the favor with which it was received encouraged it to persevere in its policy of conciliation. The Iranian gods who accompanied Mithra in his peregrinations were worshipped in the Occident under Greek and Latin names; the Avestan yazata assumed there the guise of the immortals enthroned on Olympus, and these facts are in themselves sufficient to prove that far from exhibiting hostility toward the ancient Gr\u00e6co-Roman beliefs, the Asiatic religion sought to accommodate itself to them, in appearance at least. A pious mystic could, without renouncing his faith, dedicate a votive inscription to the Capitoline triad,--Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva; he merely invested these divine names\n\nFig. 40.\nTAUROCTONOUS MITHRA\nIn the possession of Mr. S.

The left hand of the god, which has been broken off, apparently grasps a horn and not the nostrils of the bull. In all probability partly restored, it being scarcely possible that the dadophori could both have held upright torches. (T. et M., Fig. 418, p. 483.)\n\n\n\nwith a different meaning from their ordinary acceptation. If the injunction to refrain from participating in other Mysteries, which is said to have been imposed upon Mithraic initiates, was ever obeyed it was not long able to withstand the syncretic tendencies of imperial paganism. For in the fourth century the \"Fathers of the Fathers\" were found performing the highest offices of the priesthood. in temples of all sorts.\n\nEverywhere the sect knew how to adapt itself with consummate skill to the environment in which it lived. In the valley of the Danube it exercised on the indigenous cult an influence that presupposes a prolonged contact between them. In the region of the Rhine, the Celtic divinities were worshipped in the crypts of the Persian god, or at least alongside of them. Thus, the Mazdean theology, according to the country in which it flourished, was colored with variable tints, the precise gradations of which it is now impossible for us to follow. But these dogmatic shadings merely diversified the subordinate details of the religion, and never imperilled its fundamental unity. There is not the slightest evidence that these deviations of a flexible doctrine provoked heresies. The concessions which it made were matters of pure form. In reality, Mithraism having arrived in the Occident in its full maturity, and even showing signs of decrepitude, no longer assimilated the elements that it borrowed from the surrounding life. The only influences that profoundly modified its character were those to which it was subjected in its youth amidst the populations of Asia.\n\nThe close relation in which Mithra stood to certain gods of this country is explained not only by the natural affinity which united all Oriental immigrants in opposition to the paganism of Greece and Rome. The ancient religious hostility of the Egyptians and Persians persisted even in Rome under the emperors, and the Iranian Mysteries appear to have been separated from those of Isis by secret rivalry if not by open opposition. On the other hand, they associated readily with the Syrian cults that had emigrated with them from Asia and Europe. Their doctrines, thoroughly imbued with Chald\u00e6an theories, must have presented a striking resemblance to that of the Semitic religions. Jupiter Dolichenus, who was worshipped simultaneously with Mithra in Commagene, the land of his origin, and who like the latter remained a pre\u00ebminently military divinity, is found by his side in all the countries of the Occident. At Carnuntum in Pannonia, a mithr\u00e6um and a dolichenum 1 adjoined each other. Baal, the lord of the heavens, was readily identified with Ormazd, who had become Jupiter-C\u00e6lus, and Mithra was easily likened to the solar god of the Syrians. Even the rites of the two liturgies appear to have offered some resemblances. As in Commagene, so also in Phrygia, Mazdaism had sought a common ground of understanding with the religion of the country. In the union of Mithra and An\u00e2hita the counterpart was found of the intimacy between the great indigenous divinities Attis and Cybele, and this harmony between the two sacred couples persisted in Italy. The most ancient mithr\u00e6um known to us was contiguous to the metroon 1 of Ostia, and we have every reason to believe that the worship of the Iranian god and that of the Phrygian goddess were conducted in intimate communion with each other throughout the entire extent of the empire. Despite the profound differences of their character, political reasons drew them together. In conciliating the priests of the Mater Magna, the sectaries of Mithra obtained the support of a powerful and officially recognized clergy, and so shared in some measure in the protection afforded it by the State. Further, since men only were permitted to take part in the secret ceremonies of the Persian liturgy, other Mysteries to which women were admitted must have formed some species of alliance with the former, to make them complete. The Great Mother succeeded thus to the place of An\u00e2hita; she had her Matres or \"Mothers,\" as Mithra had his \"Fathers\"; and her initiates were known among one another as \"Sisters,\" just as the votaries of her associate called one another \"Brothers.\"\n\nThis alliance, fruitful generally in its results, was especially profitable to the ancient cult of Pessinus, now naturalized at Rome. The loud pomp of its festivals was a poor mask of the vacuity of its doctrines, which no longer satisfied the aspirations of its devotees. Its gross theology was elevated by the adoption of certain Mazdean beliefs. There can be scarcely any doubt that the practice of the taurobolium, with the ideas of purification and immortality appertaining to it, had passed under the Antonines from the temples of An\u00e2hita into those of the Mater Magna. The barbarous custom of allowing the blood of a victim slaughtered on a latticed platform to fall down upon the mystic lying in a pit below, was probably practised in Asia from time immemorial. According to a wide-spread notion among primitive peoples, the blood is the vehicle of the vital energy, and the person who poured it upon his body and moistened his tongue with it, believed that he was thereby endowed with the courage and strength of the slaughtered animal. This sacred bath appears to have been administered in Cappadocia in a great number of sanctuaries, and especially in those of M\u00e2, the great indigenous divinity, and in those of An\u00e2hita. These goddesses, to whom the bull was consecrated, had been generally likened by the Greeks to their Artemis Tauropolos, and the ritualistic baptism practised in their cult received the name of tauropolium (\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u1f79\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was transformed by the popular etymology into taurobolium (\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u1f79\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).\n\nBut under the influence of the Mazdean beliefs regarding the future life, a more profound significance was attributed to this baptism of blood. In taking it the devotees no longer imagined they acquired the strength of the bull; it was no longer a renewal of physical strength that the life-sustaining liquid was now thought to communicate, but a renovation, temporary or even perpetual, of the human soul.\n\nWhen, under the empire, the taurobolium was introduced into Italy, it was not quite certain at the outset what Latin name should be given the goddess in whose honor it was celebrated. Some saw in her a celestial Venus; others compared her to Minerva, because of her warlike character. But the priests of Cybele soon introduced the ceremony into their liturgy,--evidently with the complicity of the official authorities, for nothing in the ritual of this recognized cult could be modified without the authorization of the quindecemvirs. Even the emperors are known to have granted privileges to those who performed this hideous sacrifice for their salvation, though their motives for this special favor are not clearly apparent. The efficacy which was attributed to this bloody purification, the eternal new birth that was expected of it, resembled the hopes which the mystics of Mithra attached to the immolation of the mythical bull. 1 The similarity of these doctrines is quite naturally explained by the identity of their origin. The taurobolium, like many rites of the Oriental cults, is a survival of a savage past which a spiritualistic theology had adapted to moral ends. It is a characteristic fact that the first immolations of this kind that we know to have been performed by the clergy of the Phrygian goddess took place at Ostia, where the metroon, as we saw above, adjoined a Mithraic crypt.\n\nThe symbolism of the Mysteries certainly saw in the Magna Mater the nourishing Earth which the Heavens yearly fecundated. So the Gr\u00e6co-Roman divinities which they adopted changed in character on entering their dogmatic system. Sometimes, these gods were identified with the Mazdean heroes, and the barbaric legends then celebrated the new exploits which they had performed. Sometimes, they were considered the agents that produced the various transformations of the universe. Then, in the center of this pantheon, which had again become naturalistic, as it was at its origin, was placed the Sun, for he was the supreme lord that governed the movements of all the planets and even the revolutions of the heavens themselves,--the one who suffused with his light and his heat all of life here below. This conception, astronomical in its origin, predominated more and more according as Mithra entered into more intimate relations with Greek thought\n\nMithra slaying the bull.

(T. et M., p. 449.)\n\nand became a more faithful subject of the Roman state.\n\nThe worship of the Sun, the outcome of a sentiment of recognition for its daily benefactions, augmented by the observation of its tremendous r\u00f4le in the cosmic system, was the logical upshot of paganism. When critical thought sought to explain the sacred traditions and discovered in the popular gods the forces and elements of nature, it was obliged perforce to accord a predominant place to the star on which the very existence of our globe depended. \"Before religion reached the point where it proclaimed that God should be sought in the Absolute and the Ideal, that is to say, outside the world, one cult only was reasonable and scientific and that was the cult of the Sun.\" 1 From the time of Plato and Aristotle, Greek philosophy regarded the celestial bodies as animate and divine creatures; Stoicism furnished new arguments in favor of this opinion; while Neo-Pythagorism and Neo-Platonism insisted still more emphatically on the sacred character of the luminary which is the ever-present image of the intelligible God. These beliefs, approved by the thinkers, were widely diffused by literature, and particularly by the works in which romantic fiction served to envelop genuinely theological teachings.\n\nIf heliolatry was in accord with the philosophical doctrines of the day, it was not less in conformity with its political tendencies. We have essayed to show the connection which existed between the worship of the emperors and that of the Sol invictus. When the C\u00e6sars of the third century pretended to be gods descended from heaven to the earth, the justification of their imaginary claims had as its corollary the establishment of a public worship of the divinity from whom they believed themselves the emanations. Heliogabalus had claimed for his Baal of Emesa the supremacy over the\n\nFig. 42.\nMITHRAIC CAMEO (RED JASPER).\nPrincipal face: In the center, the tauroctonous Mithra, with the dog, the scorpion, the two torchbearers, etc. Reverse: A lion with a bee in his mouth; above, seven stars surrounded by magic Greek inscriptions.

The eccentricities and violences of this unbalanced man resulted in the lamentable wreck of his undertaking; but it answered to the needs of the time and was soon taken up again with better success. Near the Flaminian Way, to the east of the Field of Mars, Aurelian consecrated a colossal edifice to the tutelary god that had granted him victory in Syria. The religion of state that he constituted must not be confounded with Mithraism. Its imposing temple, its ostentatious ceremonies, its quadrennial games, its pontifical clergy, remind us of the great sanctuaries of the Orient and not of the dim caves in which the Mysteries were celebrated.\n\n\nFig. 43.\nSOL THE SUN-GOD.\nInstalled by Mithra as the governor of the world. To the right the globe of power. ( T. et M. p. 202.)\nNevertheless, the Sol invictus, whom the emperor had intended to honor with a pomp hitherto unheard of, could well be claimed as their own by the followers of Mithra.\n\nThe imperial policy gave the first place in the official religion to the Sun, of which the sovereign was the emanation, just as in the Chald\u00e6an speculations propagated by the Mithraists the royal planet held sway over the other stars. On both sides, the growing tendency was to see in the brilliant star that illuminated the universe the only God, or at least the sensible image of the only God, and to establish in the heavens a monotheism in imitation of the monarchy that ruled on earth. Macrobius (400 A.D.), in his Saturnalia, has learnedly set forth that the gods were ultimately reducible to a single Being considered under different aspects, and that the multiple names by which they were worshipped were the equivalent of that of Helios (the Sun). The theologian Vettius Agorius Pr\u00e6textatus who defended this radical syncrasy was not only one of the highest dignitaries of the empire, but one of the last chiefs of the Persian Mysteries.\n\nMithraism, at least in the fourth century, had therefore as its end and aim the union of all gods and all myths in a vast synthesis,--the foundation of a new religion in harmony with the prevailing philosophy and political constitution of the empire. This religion would have been as far removed from the ancient Iranian Mazdaism as from Gr\u00e6co-Roman paganism, which accorded the sidereal powers a minimal place only. It had in a measure traced idolatry back to its origin, and discovered in the myths that obscured its comprehension the deification of nature.\n\nBreaking with the Roman principle of the nationality of worship, it would have established the universal domination of Mithra, identified with the invincible Sun. Its adherents hoped, by concentrating all their devotion upon a single object, to impart new cohesion to the disintegrated beliefs. Solar pantheism was the last refuge of conservative spirits, now menaced by a revolutionary propaganda that aimed at the annihilation of the entire ancient order of things.\n\nAt the time when this pagan monotheism sought to establish its ascendency in Rome, the struggle between the Mithraic Mysteries and Christianity had long begun. The propagation of the two religions had been almost contemporaneously conducted, and their diffusion had taken place under analogous conditions. Both from the Orient, they had spread because of the same general reasons, viz., the political unity and the moral anarchy of the empire. Their diffusion had been accomplished with like rapidity, and toward the close of the second century they both numbered adherents in the most distant parts of the Roman world. The sectaries of Mithra might justly lay claim to the hyperbolic utterance of Tertullian: \"Hesterni sumus et vestra omnia implevimus.\" If we consider the number of the monuments that the Persian religion has left us, one may easily ask whether in the epoch of the Severi its adepts were not more numerous than the disciples of Christ. Another point of resemblance between the two antagonistic creeds was that at the outset they drew their proselytes chiefly from the inferior classes of society; their propaganda was at the origin essentially popular; unlike the philosophical sects, they addressed their endeavors less to cultivated minds than to the masses, and consequently appealed more to sentiment than to reason.\n\nBut by the side of these resemblances considerable differences are to be remarked in the methods of procedure of the two adversaries. The initial conquests of Christianity were favored by the Jewish diaspora, and it first spread in the countries inhabited by Israelitic colonies. It was therefore chiefly in the countries washed by the Mediterranean that its communities developed. They did not extend their field of action outside the cities, and their multiplication is due in great part to missions undertaken with the express purpose of \"instructing the nations.\" The extension of Mithraism, on the other hand, was essentially a natural product of social and political factors; namely, of the importation of slaves, the transportation of troops, and the transfer of public functionaries. It was in government circles and in the army that it counted its greatest number of votaries,--that is, in circles where very few Christians could be found because of their aversion to official paganism. Outside of Italy, it spread principally along the frontiers and simultaneously gained a foothold in the cities and in the country. It found its strongest points of support in the Danubian provinces and in Germany, whereas Christianity made most rapid progress in Asia Minor and Syria. The spheres of the two religious powers, therefore, were not coincident, and they could accordingly long grow and develop without coming directly into conflict. It was in the valley of the Rhone, in Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where the two competitors were most firmly established, that the rivalry, during the third century, became particularly brisk between the bands of Mithra's worshippers and the disciples of Christ.\n\nThe struggle between the two rival religions was the more stubborn as their characters were the more alike. The adepts of both formed secret conventicles, closely united, the members of which gave themselves the name of \"Brothers.\" 1 The rites which they practised offered numerous analogies. The sectaries of the Persian god, like the Christians, purified themselves by baptism; received, by a species of confirmation, the power necessary to combat the spirits of evil; and expected from a Lord's Supper salvation of body and soul. Like the latter, they also held Sunday sacred, and celebrated the birth of the Sun on the 25th of December, the same day on which Christmas has been celebrated, since the fourth century at least. They both preached a categorical system of ethics, regarded asceticism as meritorious, and counted among their principal virtues abstinence and continence, renunciation and self-control. Their conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were similar. They both admitted the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones, situate in the upper regions, and of a Hell peopled by demons, situate in the bowels of the earth. They both placed a Flood at the beginning of history; they both assigned as the source of their traditions a primitive revelation; they both, finally, believed in the immortality of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead, consequent upon a final conflagration of the universe.\n\nWe have seen that the theology of the Mysteries made of Mithra a \"mediator\" equivalent to the Alexandrian Logos. Like him, Christ also was a \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, an intermediary between his celestial father and men, and like him he also was one of a trinity. These resemblances were certainly not the only ones that pagan exegesis established between the two religions, and the figure of the tauroctonous god reluctantly immolating his victim that he might\n\n\nFig. 44.\nTHE PASSION OF THE GOD.\nThe Dying Alexander, so called. Type of a group of sculptures from the school of Pergamon, dating from the second century before Christ. The idealized portrait of Alexander as solar god has been discovered in the head of the celebrated Mithraic statue of the Capitol (see Fig. 4, page p. 21), and the facial expressions of dolor, pathos, and compassion which characterize this work are shared by all the more important representations of the Mithraic sacrifice. The present sculpture has been partly restored, and it is therefore impossible to determine absolutely whether it originally formed part of an Asiatic group of the tauroctonous Mithra. (T. et M., Introduction, p. 182.) create and save the human race, was certainly compared to the picture of the redeemer sacrificing his own person for the salvation of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, the ecclesiastical writers, reviving a metaphor of the prophet Malachi, contrasted the \"Sun of justice\" with the \"invincible Sun,\" and consented to see in the dazzling orb which illuminated men a symbol of Christ, \"the light of the world.\" Should we be astonished if the multitudes of devotees failed always to observe the subtle distinctions of the doctors, and if in obedience to a pagan custom they rendered to the radiant star of day the homage which orthodoxy reserved for God? In the fifth century, not only heretics, but even faithful followers, were still wont to bow their heads toward its dazzling disc as it rose above the horizon, and to murmur the prayer, \"Have mercy upon us.\"\n\nThe resemblances between the two hostile churches were so striking as to impress even the minds of antiquity. From the third century, the Greek philosophers were wont to draw parallels between the Persian Mysteries and Christianity which were evidently entirely in favor of the former. The Apologists also dwelt on the analogies between the two religions, and explained them as a Satanic travesty of the holiest rites of their religion. If the polemical works of the Mithraists had been preserved, we should doubtless have heard the same accusation hurled back upon their Christian adversaries.\n\nWe cannot presume to unravel to-day a question which divided contemporaries and which shall doubtless forever remain insoluble. We are too imperfectly acquainted with the dogmas and liturgies of Roman Mazdaism, as well as with the development of primitive Christianity, to say definitely what mutual influences were operative in their simultaneous evolution. But be this as it may, resemblances do not necessarily suppose an imitation. Many correspondences between the Mithraic doctrine and the Catholic faith are explicable by their common Oriental origin. Nevertheless, certain ideas and certain ceremonies must necessarily have passed from the one cult to the other; but in the majority of cases we rather suspect this transference than clearly perceive it.\n\nApparently the attempt was made to discern in the legend of the Iranian hero the counterpart of the life of Jesus, and the disciples of the Magi probably drew a direct contrast between the Mithraic worship of the shepherds, the Mithraic communion and ascension, and those of the Gospels. The rock of generation, which had given birth to the genius of light, was even compared to the immovable rock, emblem of Christ, upon which the Church was founded; and the crypt in which the bull had perished was made the counterpart of that in which Christ is said to have been born at Bethlehem. 1 But this strained parallelism could result in nothing but a caricature. It was a strong source of inferiority for Mazdaism that it believed in only a mythical redeemer. That unfailing wellspring of religious emotion supplied by the teachings and the passion of the God sacrificed on the cross, never flowed for the disciples of Mithra.\n\nOn the other hand, the orthodox and heretical liturgies of Christianity, which gradually sprang up during the first centuries of our era, could find abundant inspiration in the Mithraic Mysteries, which of all the pagan religions offered the most affinity with Christian institutions. We do not know whether the ritual of the sacraments and the hopes attaching to them suffered alteration through the influence of Mazdean dogmas and practices. Perhaps the custom of invoking the Sun three times each day,--at dawn, at noon, and at dusk,--was reproduced in the daily prayers of the Church, and it appears certain that the commemoration of the Nativity was set for the 25th of December, because it was at the winter solstice that the rebirth of the invincible god, 1 the Natalis invicti, was celebrated. In adopting this date, which was universally distinguished by sacred festivities, the ecclesiastical\n\n\n\n\nFig. 45.\nBAS-RELIEF OF MAYENCE.\nMithra drawing his bow; and the god of the winds.\n\nauthority purified in some measure the profane usages which it could not suppress.\n\nThe only domain in which we can ascertain in detail the extent to which Christianity imitated Mithraism is that of art. The Mithraic sculpture, which had been first developed, furnished the ancient Christian marble-cutters with a large number of models, which they adopted or adapted. For example, they drew inspiration from the figure of Mithra causing the living waters to leap forth by the blows of his arrows, 1 to create the figure of Moses smiting with his rod the rock of Horeb (Fig. 45). Faithful to an inveterate tradition, they even reproduced the figures of cosmic divinities, like the Heavens and the Winds, the worship of which the new faith had expressly proscribed; and we find on the sarcophagi, in miniatures, and even on the portals of the Romance Churches, evidences of the influence exerted by the imposing compositions that adorned the sacred grottos of Mithra.\n\nIt would be wrong, however, to exaggerate the significance of these likenesses. If Christianity and Mithraism offered profound resemblances, the principal of which were the belief in the purification of souls and the hope of a beatific resurrection, differences no less essential separated them. The most important was the contrast of their relations to Roman paganism. The Mazdean Mysteries sought to conciliate paganism by a succession of adaptations and compromises; they endeavored to establish monotheism while not combating polytheism, whereas the Church was, in point of principle, if not always in practice, the unrelenting antagonist of idolatry in any form. The attitude of Mithraism was apparently the wiser; it gave to the Persian religion greater elasticity and powers of adaptation, and it attracted toward the tauroctonous god all who stood in dread of a painful rupture with ancient traditions and contemporaneous society. The preference must therefore have been given by many to dogmas that satisfied their aspirations for greater purity and a better world, without compelling them to detest the faith of their fathers and the State of which they were citizens. As the Church grew in power despite its persecutors, this policy of compromise first assured to Mithraism much tolerance and afterward even the favor of the public authorities. But it also prevented it from freeing itself of the gross and ridiculous superstitions which complicated its ritual and its theology; it involved it, in spite of its austerity, in an equivocal alliance with the orgiastic cult of the beloved of Attis; and it compelled it to carry the entire weight of a chimerical and odious past. If Romanized Mazdaism had triumphed, it would not only have preserved from oblivion all the aberrations of pagan mysticism, but would also have perpetuated the erroneous doctrine of physics on which its dogmatism reposed. The Christian doctrine, which broke with the cults of nature, remained exempt from these impure associations, and its liberation from every compromising attachment assured it an immense superiority. Its negative value, its struggle against deeply-rooted prejudices, gained for it as many souls as did the positive hopes which it promised. It performed the miraculous feat of triumphing over the ancient world in spite of legislation and the imperial policy, and the Mithraic Mysteries were promptly abolished the moment the protection of the State was withdrawn and transformed into hostility.\n\nMithraism reached the apogee of its power toward the middle of the third century, and it appeared for a moment as if the world was on the verge of becoming Mithraic. But the first invasions of the barbarians, and especially the definitive loss of Dacia (275 A.D.), soon after followed by that of the Agri Decumates, administered a terrible blow to the Mazdean sect, which was most powerful in the periphery of the orbis Romanus. In all Pannonia, and as far as Virunum, on the frontiers of Italy, its temples were sacked. By way of compensation, the authorities, menaced by the rapid progress of Christianity, renewed their support to the most redoubtable adversary that they could oppose to it. In the universal downfall the army was the only institution that remained standing, and the C\u00e6sars created by the legions were bound perforce to seek their support in the favored religion of their soldiers. In 273 A.D., Aurelian founded by the side of the Mysteries of the tauroctonous god a public religion, which he richly endowed, in honor of the Sol invictus. Diocletian, whose court with its complicated hierarchy, its prostrations before its lord, and its crowds of eunuchs, was, by the admission of contemporaries, an imitation of the court of the Sassanids, was naturally inclined to adopt doctrines of Persian origin, which flattered his despotic instincts. The emperor and the princes whom he had associated with himself, meeting in conference at Carnuntum in 307 A.D., restored there one of the temples of the celestial protector of their newly-organized empire. 1 The Christians believed, not without some appearance of reason, that the Mithraic clergy were the instigators of the great persecutions under Galerius. In the Roman empire as in Iran, a vaguely monistic heliolatry appeared on the verge of becoming the sole, intolerant religion of state. But the conversion of Constantine shattered the hopes which the policy of his predecessors had held out to the worshippers of the sun. Although he did not persecute the beliefs which he himself had shared, 2 they ceased to constitute a recognized cult and were tolerated only. His successors were outspokenly hostile. To latent defiance succeeded open persecution. Christian polemics no longer restricted its attacks to ridiculing the legends and practices of the Mazdean Mysteries, nor even to taunting them for having as their founders the irreconcilable enemies of Rome; it now stridently demanded the total destruction of idolatry, and its exhortations were promptly carried into effect. When a rhetorician 1 tells us that under Constantius no one longer dared to look at the rising or setting sun, that even farmers and sailors refrained from observing the stars, and tremblingly held their eyes fixed upon the ground, we have in these emphatic declarations a magnified echo of the fears that then filled all pagan hearts.\n\nThe proclamation of Julian the Apostate (331-363 A.D.) suddenly inaugurated an unexpected turn in affairs. A philosopher, seated on the throne by the armies of Gaul, Julian had cherished from childhood a secret devotion for Helios. He was firmly convinced that this god had rescued him from the perils that menaced his youth; he believed that he was entrusted by him with a divine mission, and regarded himself as his servitor, or rather as his spiritual son. He dedicated to this celestial \"king\" a discourse in which the ardor of his faith transforms in places a cold theological dissertation into an inflamed dithyrambic, and the fervor of his devotion for the star that he worshipped never waned to the moment of his death.\n\nThe young prince had been presumably drawn to the Mysteries by his superstitious predilection for the supernatural. Before his accession, perhaps even from youth, he had been introduced secretly into a Mithraic conventicle by the philosopher Maximus of Ephesus. The ceremonies of his initiation must have made a deep impression on his feelings. He imagined himself thenceforward under the special patronage of Mithra, in this life and in that to come. As soon as he had cast aside his mask and openly proclaimed himself a pagan, he called Maximus to his side, and doubtless had recourse to extraordinary ablutions and purifications to wipe out the stains which he had contracted in receiving the baptism and the communion of the Christians. Scarcely had he ascended the throne (361 A.D.) than he made haste to introduce the Persian cult at Constantinople; and almost simultaneously the first taurobolia were celebrated at Athens.\n\nOn all sides the sectaries of the Magi lifted their heads. At Alexandria the patriarch George, in attempting to erect a church on the ruins of a mithr\u00e6um, provoked a sanguinary riot. Arrested by the magistrates, he was torn from his prison and cruelly slain by the populace on the 24th of December, 361, the eve of the Natalis invicti. The emperor contented himself with addressing a paternal remonstrance to the city of Serapis.\n\nBut the Apostate soon met his death in the historic expedition against the Persians, to which he had possibly been drawn by the secret desire to conquer the land which had given him his faith and by the assurance that his tutelary god would accept his homage rather than that of his enemies. Thus perished this spasmodic attempt at reaction, and Christianity, now definitively victor, addressed itself to the task of extirpating the erroneous doctrine that had caused it so much anxiety. Even before the emperors had forbidden the exercise of idolatry, their edicts against astrology and magic furnished an indirect means of attacking the clergy and disciples of Mithra. In 371 A.D., a number of persons who cultivated occult practices were implicated in a pretended conspiracy and put to death. The mystagogue Maximus himself perished as the victim of an accusation of this kind.\n\nIt was not long before the imperial government legislated formally and directly against the disgraced sect. In the provinces, popular uprisings frequently anticipated the interference of the magistrates. Mobs sacked the temples and committed them to the flames, with the complicity of the authorities. The ruins of the mithr\u00e6ums bear witness to the violence of their devastating fury. Even at Rome, in 377 A.D., the prefect Gracchus, seeking the privilege of baptism, offered as a pledge of the sincerity of his conversion the \"destruction, shattering, and shivering,\" 1 of a Mithraic crypt, with all the statues that it contained. Frequently, in order to protect their grottoes from pillage by making, them inaccessible, the priests walled up the entrances, or conveyed their sacred images to well-protected hiding-places, convinced that the tempest\n\n\nFig. 46.\nCHAINED SKELETON.\nDiscovered in the ruins of a Mithraic temple at Sarrebourg, in Lorraine. (T. et M., p. 519.)\n\n\n\nthat had burst upon them was momentary only, and that after their days of trial their god would cause again to shine forth the light of final triumph. On the other hand, the Christians, in order to render places contaminated by the presence of a dead body ever afterward unfit for worship, sometimes slew the refractory priests of Mithra and buried them in the ruins of their sanctuaries, now forever profaned (Fig. 46).\n\nThe hope of restoration was especially tenacious at Rome, which remained the capital of paganism. The aristocracy, still faithful to the traditions of their ancestors, supported the religion with their wealth and prestige. Its members loved to deck themselves with the titles of \"Father and Herald of Mithra Invincible,\" and multiplied the offerings and the foundations. They redoubled their generosity toward him when Gratian in 382 A.D. despoiled their temples of their wealth. A great lord recounts to us in poor verses how he had restored a splendid crypt erected by his grandfather near the Flaminian Way, boasting that he was able to dispense with public subsidies of any kind. 1 The usurpation of Eugenius appeared for a moment to bring on the expected resurrection. The prefect of the pr\u00e6torium, Nicomachus Flavianus, celebrated solemn taurobolia and renewed in a sacred cave the Mysteries of the \"associate god\" (deum comitem) of the pretender. But the victory of Theodosius, 394 A.D., shattered once and for all the hopes of these belated partisans of the ancient Mazdean belief.\n\nA few clandestine conventicles may, with stubborn persistence, have been held in the subterranean retreats of the palaces. The cult of the Persian god possibly existed as late as the fifth century in certain remote cantons of the Alps and the Vosges. For example, devotion to the Mithraic rites long persisted in the tribe of the Anauni, masters of a flourishing valley, of which a narrow defile closed the mouth. But little by little its last disciples in the Latin countries abandoned a religion tainted with moral as well as political decadence. It maintained its ground with greater tenacity in the Orient, the land of its birth. Driven out of the rest of the empire, it found a refuge in the countries of its origin, where its light only slowly flickered out.\n\nNevertheless, the conceptions which Mithraism had diffused throughout the empire during a period of three centuries were not destined to perish with it. Some of them, even those most characteristic of it, such as its ideas concerning Hell, the efficacy of the sacraments, and the resurrection of the flesh, were accepted even by its adversaries; and in disseminating them it had simply accelerated their universal domination. Certain of its sacred practices continued to exist also in the ritual of Christian festivals and in popular usage. Its fundamental dogmas, however, were irreconcilable with orthodox Christianity, outside of which only they could maintain their hold. Its theory of sidereal influences, alternately condemned and tolerated, was carried down by astrology to the threshold of modern times; but it was to a religion more powerful than this false science that the Persian Mysteries were destined to bequeath. along with their hatred of the Church, their cardinal ideas and their influence over the masses.\n\nManich\u00e6ism, although the work of a man and not the product of a long evolution, was connected with these Mysteries by numerous affinities. The tradition according to which its original founders had conversed in Persia with the priests of Mithra may be inexact in form, but it involves nevertheless a profound truth. Both religions had been formed in the Orient from a mixture of the ancient Babylonian mythology with Persian dualism, and had afterward absorbed Hellenic elements. The sect of Manich\u00e6us spread throughout the empire during the fourth century, at the moment when Mithraism was expiring, and it was called to assume the latter's succession. Mystics whom the polemics of the Church against paganism had shaken but not converted were enraptured with the new conciliatory faith which suffered Zoroaster and Christ to be simultaneously worshipped. The wide diffusion which the Mazdean beliefs with their mixture of Chald\u00e6ism had enjoyed, prepared the minds of the empire for the reception of the new heresy. The latter found its way made smooth for it, and this is the secret of its sudden expansion. Thus renewed, the Mithraic doctrines were destined to withstand for centuries all persecutions, and rising again in a new form in the Middle Ages to shake once more the ancient Roman world.", "http://genius.com/Franz-cumont-the-mysteries-of-mithra-mithraism-and-the-religions-of-the-empire-annotated"], "462323": ["Names of People (Chapter 1) by\u00a0Marcel\u00a0Proust", "Names of People (Chapter 1) Lyrics\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER ONE\n\nNAMES OF PEOPLE: THE DUCHESSE DE GUERMANTES \u2014 SAINT-LOUP AT DONCI\u00c8RES \u2014 MME.

Every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced even silence with a strained attention. And as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a Fran\u00e7oise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was \u2018so well respected on all sides\u2019 and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I, who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one\u2019s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went straight to Fran\u00e7oise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The \u2018sensibility\u2019 claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. Fran\u00e7oise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still a \u2018temperature,\u2019 and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Fran\u00e7oise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a day\u2019s journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a king\u2019s ransom, not if you were to offer her millions \u2014 a pure hypothesis \u2014 and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and \u2018usual offices\u2019) was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it is high time now that the reader should be told \u2014 and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air \u2014 was a flat forming part of the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy M\u00e9lusine should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive \u2018restorations\u2019 of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year \u2014 like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them \u2014 enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied\u2019s marriage, brings back to me that mauve \u2014 so delicate, almost too bright, too new \u2014 with which the billowy scarf of the young Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when my first nurse \u2014 knowing no more, probably, than I know to-day in whose honour it had been composed \u2014 sang me to sleep with that old ditty, Gloire \u00e0 la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran Mar\u00e9chal de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid\u2019s bosom swell with pride, stopped in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to remark: \u201cA fine child that!\u201d and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born \u2014 from the accounts given me by other people. But more recently I find in the period of that name\u2019s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And, with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place \u2014 right at the end of that \u2018Guermantes way\u2019 along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my parents the course of the Vivonne \u2014 to that land of bubbling streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions \u2014 in the realm of topographical science \u2014 required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in \u2018adrianople\u2019 and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this H\u00f4tel de Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin\u2019s chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes had become \u2014 as the Louvre might have been in days gone by \u2014 a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme. de Guermantes in a wing of the H\u00f4tel. It was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour \u2014 whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord \u2014 is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemaker\u2019s, for instance, or a tailor\u2019s, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a \u2018Comtesse\u2019 who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter\u2019s lodge (with, by the coachman\u2019s side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter\u2019s children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to Fran\u00e7oise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the Guermantes (to whom Fran\u00e7oise regularly alluded as the people \u2018below,\u2019 or \u2018downstairs\u2019) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma\u2019s hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: \u201cLook at that, now; a pair of holy Sisters; that\u2019ll be for downstairs, surely;\u201d or, \u201cOh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the Duke will have been out with his gun!\u201d\u2014 until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: \u201cThey\u2019re having company down below; gay doings, I\u2019ll be bound;\u201d whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the keenest interest in Fran\u00e7oise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. For Fran\u00e7oise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible \u2014 though by no means legible \u2014 to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running \u2018aside,\u2019 but not so that we could catch her words. She called this practice \u2014 which, she imagined, must be infuriating, \u2018mortifying\u2019 as she herself put it,\u2018vexing\u2019 to us \u2014\u2018saying low masses all the blessed day.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last rites accomplished, Fran\u00e7oise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank \u2018her\u2019 young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: \u201cCome, ma\u2019am, a drop more of the grape; it\u2019s d\u2019licious to-day,\u201d and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in \u2018this wretched kitchen.\u2019 Dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Combray, Combray!\u201d she cried. And the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the Southerner? \u201cAh, Combray, when shall I look on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then he makes out I don\u2019t come quick enough; you\u2019d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you\u2019re a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray; maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in Franchise\u2019s affections. Having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour\u2019s attention, in order to bid her good day. The coquetry of the young girl that Fran\u00e7oise had once been softened and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe Mamma\u2019s orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her \u2018a whole chapter\u2019 from the Mistress. She pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: \u201cA fine pair, eh!\u201d though what she actually muttered was: \u201cWhat an old rattle-trap!\u201d but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, I dare say, only you don\u2019t care for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: \u201cTastes differ, you know; simplicity\u2019s the rule in this house,\u201d shut the window again in case Mamma should come in. These \u2018you\u2019 who might have had more horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right in saying \u2018you\u2019 since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Fran\u00e7oise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed \u2014 with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece \u2014 the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it can be understood that Fran\u00e7oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my father\u2019s claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called \u2018wearying,\u2019 wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by Corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s wearying had soon been cured by none other than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. \u201cVery good class, those Juliens,\u201d (for Fran\u00e7oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) \u201cvery worthy people; you can see it written on their faces.\u201d Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. This new friend of Fran\u00e7oise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A waistcoat-maker first of all, with the \u2018chit of a girl\u2019 whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies\u2019 fashions and become a seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker\u2019s workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien\u2019s presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the \u2018regular establishment\u2019 was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help Fran\u00e7oise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time, and without underrating his value to Fran\u00e7oise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien\u2019s (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was convinced that Jupien\u2019s life would soon be cut short. Kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of Fran\u00e7oise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to put up with understudies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Fran\u00e7oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for Mamma\u2019s answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we \u2018did not have\u2019 any particular thing, it was because we had \u2018no wish\u2019 for it. If she made such a point of other people\u2019s knowing that we \u2018had money\u2019 (for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply \u2018have money,\u2019 \u2018fetch water\u2019), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other\u2019s attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly \u2014 otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her \u2018every conceivable insult\u2019\u2014 Fran\u00e7oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,\u201d began my father\u2019s valet; \u201cI had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army with one of the Baron de Guermantes\u2019s stud grooms. Does your mother know you\u2019re out?\u201d added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: \u201cAlways the same, that Victor!\u201d And she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin \u2014 if remotely \u2014 to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce against the clergy. Fran\u00e7oise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess must be connected with all that lot,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. \u201cI can\u2019t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the Duke. It\u2019s the same kindred, anyway. Ay, they\u2019re a great family, the Guermantes!\u201d she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single word \u2018great\u2019 to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. \u201cI wonder now if it wouldn\u2019t be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at Algiers, too.\u201d My mother and I long asked ourselves who this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that Fran\u00e7oise meant by the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 the town of Angers. What is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. Fran\u00e7oise, who knew the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. \u201cI meant to talk to their butler about it. What is it again you call him?\u201d she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: \u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s Antoine you call him!\u201d as though Antoine had been a title. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who could tell me, but he\u2019s quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you\u2019d say they\u2019d cut his tongue out, or that he\u2019d forgotten to learn to speak. He makes no response when you talk to him,\u201d went on Fran\u00e7oise, who used \u2018make response\u2019 in the same sense as Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, quite untruthfully, \u201cso long as I know what\u2019s boiling in my pot, I don\u2019t bother my head about what\u2019s in other people\u2019s. Whatever he is, he\u2019s not a Catholic. Besides, he\u2019s not a courageous man.\u201d (This criticism might have led one to suppose that Fran\u00e7oise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. \u2018Courageous\u2019 meant simply a hard worker.) \u201cThey do say, too, that he\u2019s thievish as a magpie, but it doesn\u2019t do to believe all one hears. The servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no better,\u201d concluded Fran\u00e7oise, who, in furnishing the name \u2018Antoine\u2019 with a feminine ending that would designate the butler\u2019s wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. If so, she was not far wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of olden days of whom Fran\u00e7oise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: \u201cBut one thing sure and certain is that it\u2019s the Duchess that has Guermantes Castle. And it\u2019s she that is the Lady Mayoress down in those parts. That\u2019s always something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can well believe that it is something,\u201d came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think so, do you, my boy, you think it\u2019s something? Why, for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it\u2019s just thank you for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you wouldn\u2019t see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I\u2019m sure a family who\u2019ve got something to go on with, like Monsieur and Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they\u2019re free to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off retiring? They\u2019ve got everything they want. Why wait till they\u2019re dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I\u2019d have of it at home in my brother\u2019s poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel you\u2019re alive; you haven\u2019t all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat must indeed be fine!\u201d exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in the household than my father\u2019s valet, he used to talk to Fran\u00e7oise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. And Fran\u00e7oise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the \u2018housekeeper,\u2019 that peculiar tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a \u2018Highness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt any rate one knows what one\u2019s about, there, and what time of year it is. It isn\u2019t like here where you won\u2019t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you would at Christmas, and I can\u2019t hear so much as the tiniest ang\u00e9lus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. Down there, you can hear every hour; there\u2019s only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: \u2018My brother will be coming in from the field now,\u2019 and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. But here it\u2019s daytime and it\u2019s nighttime, and you go to bed, and you can\u2019t say any more than the dumb beasts what you\u2019ve been about all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather M\u00e9s\u00e9glise is a fine place, too, Madame,\u201d broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention M\u00e9s\u00e9glise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, is it?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names \u2014 M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is M\u00e9s\u00e9glise;\u201d she went on with a tinkling laugh, \u201cbut how did you ever come to hear tell of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did I hear of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise? But it\u2019s a well-known place; people have told me about it \u2014 yes, over and over again,\u201d he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you, it\u2019s better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since Eulalie\u2019s death Fran\u00e7oise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to \u2018put on airs.\u2019 It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her \u2018trifle\u2019 from my aunt. As for the latter, Fran\u00e7oise never left off singing her praises\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of Madame?\u201d asked the young footman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, with Mme. Octave \u2014 oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise used the word \u2018pity\u2019 in the sense given it by Labruy\u00e8re.) \u201cIt was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years.\u201d (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for Fran\u00e7oise belonged to an epoch when the words \u2018damages\u2019 was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) \u201cAh, I can tell you, people didn\u2019t go empty away from that house. As his reverence the Cur\u00e9 has told us, many\u2019s the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: \u2018You know, Fran\u00e7oise, I can eat nothing myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if I could.\u2019 They weren\u2019t for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. If you\u2019d only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasn\u2019t that much of her. She would never listen to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it wasn\u2019t in that house that you\u2019d have to gobble down your dinner. She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it\u2019s been just the same again to-day; we haven\u2019t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her \u2018dancing.\u2019 \u201cI can tell you frankly,\u201d the young footman assured her, \u201cthat I never saw the like.\u201d He said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the butler muttered, \u201cbut that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other evening that he\u2019s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it.\u201d There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father\u2019s immediately turning him out of the house. But the philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Fran\u00e7oise to expect that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. \u201cSo long as the world goes round, look, there\u2019ll be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding.\u201d In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as Fran\u00e7oise in reckoning the duration of the latter\u2019s dinner) had been saying:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat on earth can they be doing? They\u2019ve been at least two hours at their dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rang timidly three or four times. Fran\u00e7oise, \u2018her\u2019 footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, Fran\u00e7oise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got the jumps to-day, surely,\u201d going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Fran\u00e7oise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth\u2019s surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in his \u2018Harmonies in Blue and Silver,\u2019 so the name Guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: \u201cShe is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d No doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it became all the more essential that I should be able to explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s house, were I one of her friends, were I to penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my father\u2019s friend had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in the Faubourg Saint-Germain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess\u2019s parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the Presence of Our Lord\u2019s Body in the Host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-German, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs \u2014 endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa \u2014 without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them. And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien\u2019s shop, whereupon Jupien, to the Duke\u2019s indignation, demanded compensation. \u201cIf it were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cit is an outrage on this fellow\u2019s part to claim a penny from us.\u201d But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what \u2018good\u2019 the Duchess had ever done. And yet she did do good, but \u2014 since one cannot do good to everybody at once \u2014 the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the Duke \u2014 and this over a considerable area \u2014 to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called him \u2018M. Norpois,\u2019 not being certain of his name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois next!\u201d exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him as \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 instead of \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan\u2019s or courtier\u2019s shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no bargain about my father\u2019s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s footmen was in the habit of talking to Fran\u00e7oise, I picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-night there\u2019s a big party with a Chinese shadow show at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s,\u201d said the footman, \u201cbut we shan\u2019t be going, because at five o\u2019clock Madame is taking the train to Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Due d\u2019Aumale; but it\u2019ll be the lady\u2019s maid and valet that are going with her. I\u2019m to stay here. She won\u2019t be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won\u2019t, that\u2019s four times already she\u2019s written to Madame la Duchesse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you won\u2019t be going down to Guermantes Castle this year?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we shan\u2019t be going there: it\u2019s because of the Duke\u2019s rheumatics, the doctor says he\u2019s not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but we\u2019ve been there every year till now, right on to January. If the hot pipes aren\u2019t ready, perhaps Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de Guise, but nothing\u2019s settled yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe go now and then to the Op\u00e9ra, usually on the evenings when the Princesse de Parme has her box, that\u2019s once a week; it seems it\u2019s a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes Madame\u2019s friends take, one one night, another another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke\u2019s cousin\u2019s lady. She\u2019s sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you\u2019ve got to run upstairs again now, have you?\u201d went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat Fran\u00e7oise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. \u201cYou enjoy good health, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, if it wasn\u2019t for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain I can still get along\u201d (\u2018on the plain\u2019 meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where Fran\u00e7oise had no objection to walking, in other words \u2018on a plane surface\u2019) \u201cbut it\u2019s these stairs that do me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France, be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Fran\u00e7oise, to whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally called Prince d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, would at once exclaim: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, that is!\u201d and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise learned also from the Prince d\u2019Agrigente\u2019s valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac, and that it was practically settled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of Parme, of Guermantes-Baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but, in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person\u2019s life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from Fran\u00e7oise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, \u2018A.J.\u2019 Well, somehow or other, this A. J. found himself entitled to a stall at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of Ph\u00e8dre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a sense of melancholy that I realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything. It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No deep-lying soul inhabited it any more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera, I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken, but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or \u2018big business\u2019 a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy banker\u2019s son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his double) say with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know the number; it was my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin\u2019s box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to \u2018my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box,\u2019 so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word \u2018box\u2019 and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the Greek warrior in the hour of battle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from Ph\u00e8dre which I could not quite remember. In the form in which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water\u2019s brink. And, after all, this excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a single foot\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive \u2014 avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little caf\u00e9s, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck \u2014 like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see \u2014 the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark background, the bent profile of the Due d\u2019Aumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming \u201cMonseigneur must allow me to take his coat,\u201d to which the Prince replied, \u201cOh, come, come! Really, Madame d\u2019Ambresac.\u201d She took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon\u2019s nest. Over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the Princess\u2019s eyes. The beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Guermantes,\u201d said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word \u2018Princesse\u2019 with a string of P\u2019s, to shew that a title like that was absurd. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been sparing with her pearls. I\u2019m sure, if I had as many as that, I wouldn\u2019t make such a display of them; it doesn\u2019t look at all well, not to my mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed, with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess in her palaces in Munich and in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): \u201cDo have one, won\u2019t you?\u201d What mattered that to me? I should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: \u201cThanks; I should like a cherry.\u201d And I should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from Le Mari de la D\u00e9butante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganan\u00e7ay,\u201d came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now, because the act ofPh\u00e8dre in which Berma was playing was due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess, ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Za\u00efre, or perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row I saw that the soft halcyon\u2019s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was \u2014 downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist\u2019s part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. Ph\u00e8dre, the \u2018Declaration Scene,\u2019 Berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,  Ph\u00e8dre and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when, ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of Ph\u00e8dre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay the thought of perfection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne and Hippolyte. It was not that the players \u2014 they were the same, by the way \u2014 did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations bade the voice: \u201cBe gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo\u201d; or else, \u201cnow wax furious,\u201d and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: \u201cBe majestic.\u201d But each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. At this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She\u2019s too old; she can\u2019t play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just corne on to the stage. And then \u2014 oh, the miracle \u2014 like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life \u2014 the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as Ph\u00e8dre, which I had myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne or Hippolyte I had been able to distinguish, but Ph\u00e8dre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. Berma\u2019s voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of Aricie or Ism\u00e8ne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma\u2019s arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o\u00ee water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. So Berma\u2019s interpretation was, around Racine\u2019s work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I had come to her with too strong a desire. Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought to it the ideas of \u2018beauty,\u2019 \u2018breadth of style,\u2019 \u2018pathos\u2019 and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a \u2018correct\u2019 face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. It asks itself: \u201cIs that good? Is what I am feeling just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength?\u201d And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for \u2018breadth of interpretation.\u2019 And for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was precisely what Berma\u2019s acting shewed me. This was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars, Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of \u2018nobility of interpretation,\u2019 of \u2018originality,\u2019 and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to myself: \u201cAt last I am listening to Berma.\u201d And the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: \u201cWell, I do not admire this.\u201d But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of Berma\u2019s acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This genius of which Berma\u2019s rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing more?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from Ph\u00e8dre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the author\u2019s other works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of Ph\u00e8dre. Not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and Berma\u2019s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? But Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate Berma\u2019s attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterday\u2019s impression had refused to afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have said to one of my schoolfellows: \u201cCertainly, I put Berma first!\u201d not without a confused feeling that Berma\u2019s genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a \u2018first\u2019 place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s box. The Princess was in the act \u2014 by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void \u2014 of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the Jockey Club \u2014 who at that moment, and among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I should most have liked to be \u2014 the familiar \u2018good evening\u2019 of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her \u2018exaggerations\u2019 (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as \u2018dressed up,\u2019 and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the Princess\u2019s head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively British. But different as their two costumes were, after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little \u2018tailor-made\u2019 in her cousin\u2019s way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an \u2018arrangement\u2019 supposed to suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of raven\u2019s feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s presence on this occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which \u2014 for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge \u2014 she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes, lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s), M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the same evening. \u201cPerhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose to hear Berma,\u201d thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: \u201cThe Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society.\u201d For myself, who derived from the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Cond\u00e9 what I imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre than that of the greatest critic in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded that their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering along the Guermantes way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Cond\u00e9, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousin\u2019s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk \u2014 and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking \u2014 a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the Duchess\u2019s usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so often sought to evoke from the woods of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On coming home from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique I had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin\u2019s box. I would follow the course which Fran\u00e7oise had told me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had long held and which Albertine\u2019s coldness, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de Guermantes at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association \u2014 exclusive of every other feminine form \u2014 with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the difference \u2014 never twice, as it happened, the same \u2014 between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair \u2014 all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the Ph\u00e8dre evening, acknowledged my salute, which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird\u2019s beak that I saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycook\u2019s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his \u2018day out\u2019 stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme. Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions\u2019 losing their importance for me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which Fran\u00e7oise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence, for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the European colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to Fran\u00e7oise. My parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than Fran\u00e7oise to my person, still I should have been no better off. Fran\u00e7oise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had \u2018a place of their own\u2019 but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated with the words of Fran\u00e7oise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mother\u2019s deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had entered our service she had acquired \u2014 as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired \u2014 the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were \u2018employers\u2019 after all. This alteration in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019\u00bb character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a Pharaoh or a Doge \u2014 and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had dismissed Fran\u00e7oise, to keep the same servant. For various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like \u2018the lower orders\u2019 or \u2018the servant class.\u2019 But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing Fran\u00e7oise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to Fran\u00e7oise, I never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it, or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than Fran\u00e7oise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than Fran\u00e7oise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering one\u2019s head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by Fran\u00e7oise); I ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When Fran\u00e7oise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with Fran\u00e7oise so different from that on which I used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, Fran\u00e7oise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. So far it was only Fran\u00e7oise that was revealed, and of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one\u2019s social relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future\u2019s secret. For the present only Fran\u00e7oise was concerned. Did she sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint Jupien\u2019s girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether Fran\u00e7oise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information \u2014 a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me \u2014 me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner \u2014 and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I would then tell Fran\u00e7oise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, Fran\u00e7oise, borrowing the expression from her daughter\u2019s vocabulary, used to remark that I was \u2018dippy.\u2019 She did not approve of this; she said that I was always \u2018balancing,\u2019 for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as \u2018where there isn\u2019t a will.\u2019 I should never have had the heart to leave Paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the \u2018Guermantes\u2019 that she was \u2014 this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which \u2014 as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see \u2014 indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six o\u2019clock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. \u201cOh! What a bore!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. \u201cI have just had a week\u2019s leave, and I shan\u2019t be off duty again for another week.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can\u2019t recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition ground, where there\u2019s a show just starting; you\u2019ll find it beastly crowded. No, you\u2019d better go to the H\u00f4tel de Flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It \u2018makes\u2019 quite an \u2018old-world residence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word \u2018makes\u2019 for \u2018has the air of,\u2019 because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the \u2018turns of speech\u2019 that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. \u201cBesides,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe hotel I mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that.\u201d But to me, less of an artist than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed gaze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; you\u2019re quite pale; and here am I like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won\u2019t have the heart to look at, even. I know the room they\u2019ll put you in; personally I find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won\u2019t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You mustn\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; I don\u2019t feel the same myself, but I can put myself in your place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he resumed; \u201cI assure you that I fully understand; I feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched,\u201d he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, \u201cwhen I think that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you won\u2019t want to read if you\u2019re feeling like that. And I shan\u2019t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I\u2019ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRun along and light the fire in my quarters,\u201d he called to a trooper who passed us. \u201cHurry up; get a move on!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell me all about yourself presently. We\u2019ll go up to my room; we mustn\u2019t hang about too long on the square, there\u2019s the devil of a draught; I don\u2019t feel it now myself, but you aren\u2019t accustomed to it, I\u2019m afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work; have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your talent I\u2019m sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it\u2019s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, won\u2019t. There, and I\u2019ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are in safe keeping. I never part from them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must just say a word to the Captain,\u201d whispered Saint-Loup. \u201cBe a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It\u2019s the second on the right, on the third floor; I\u2019ll be with you in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at Donci\u00e8res, and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de la R\u00e9publique. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup\u2019s room. I stood for a moment outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited. Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup\u2019s watch, which could not be far away. This tick changed its place every moment \u2018for I could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in Saint-Loup\u2019s fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the Grand\u2019place of Donci\u00e8res. Let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the \u2018other person\u2019 with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person\u2019s hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like L boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard \u2014 sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window \u2014 be it barracks, church, or town hall \u2014 is only so much scenery. If one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,\u201d I said to him; \u201chow jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam; \u2014 a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019d rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself?\u201d Saint-Loup asked me, smiling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it,\u201d I pleaded; \u201cyou know it\u2019s not possible, and you know how wretched I shall be over there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood! You flatter me!\u201d he replied. \u201cIt occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd he has given you leave?\u201d I cried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe hadn\u2019t the slightest objection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! I adore him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner,\u201d he went on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were several times interrupted by one or other of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends\u2019 coming in. He drove them all out again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here. Buzz off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begged him to let them stay\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. Besides, I don\u2019t want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments I\u2019ve been looking forward to. But you mustn\u2019t think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We have a major here who is a splendid chap. He\u2019s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldn\u2019t fail to appreciate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the officer who\u2019s given me leave to stay here to-night?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; thank God! The man you \u2018adore\u2019 for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he\u2019s a freemason and doesn\u2019t go to confession. The Prince de Borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is pretty fair cheek, when all\u2019s said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn\u2019t been for the Napoleonic wars. Not that he hasn\u2019t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where he\u2019s neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called Prince,\u201d added Robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the Empire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon\u2019s beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out \u2014 in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin \u2014 of Robert\u2019s face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt\u2019s. I saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude \u2014 the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup\u2019s window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought as of absent \u2014 or dead \u2014 friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at Donci\u00e8res, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup\u2019s batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill \u2014 the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun\u2019s rays, which, an hour later, when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I must bring into contact with its environment that \u2018Self\u2019 which I rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company \u2014 neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the Alps to find that the act \u2014 as a rule not noticed \u2014 of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass \u2014 of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory \u2014 offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug. The walls held the room in \u00e0 close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply \u201cNow you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours,\u201d while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I could easily come in barefoot, and\u2019 the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. We awake, look at our watch, see \u2018four o\u2019clock\u2019; it is only four o\u2019clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor\u2019s orb of gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on several occasions \u2014 and I mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea \u2014 the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard the band, I was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of looking on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one\u2019s dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief \u2018absence\u2019 to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less \u2018good\u2019 night. But already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which \u2018auto-suggestions\u2019 prepare \u2014 like witches \u2014 the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: \u201cIt is seven o\u2019clock,\u201d she will find us awake and ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried. Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of sleep is called \u2018sleeping like lead,\u2019 and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one\u2019s mind, one\u2019s personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover one\u2019s own self rather than any other? Why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterday\u2019s that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one\u2019s hand? What is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption \u2014 whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening \u2014 after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep \u2014 must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky \u2014 but discouraged by the chill \u2014 of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially possible \u2014 I knew that it was extremely difficult for him \u2014 I should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What can I do to help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for action\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d I asked him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must leave you, I\u2019m afraid; we\u2019re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen it\u2019s been a great bother to you, coming here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you understand, I don\u2019t like to seem to be abusing the privilege.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you\u2019ll be training, it would interest me immensely, and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the d\u00e9min\u00e9ralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustn\u2019t go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as they\u2019ve passed I think you\u2019ll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in the military theories which Saint-Loup\u2019s friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the caf\u00e9s in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec, after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good night\u2019s rest. Good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel! As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the \u2018romances\u2019 beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. These thoughts carried me far\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for Robert \u2014 he being engaged on some duty or other \u2014 outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup\u2019s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass to Paris, they had seen supping in the Caf\u00e9 de la Paix with the Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s and the Prince d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. And on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress \u2014 the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade \u2014 they had introduced the idea of a \u2018tone\u2019 which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. \u201cHe can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday morning in the All\u00e9e des Acacias; now he\u2019s got some style on a horse!\u201d replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in Robert\u2019s squadron, and to whom he had said how d\u2019ye do \u2018most civilly,\u2019 while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker\u2019s direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, my brother saw him at the Paix,\u201d said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; \u201cmy brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn\u2019t fit him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat was the waistcoat like?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the \u2018old soldiers\u2019 (sons of the soil who had never heard of the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the \u2018stripes\u2019 in the regiment, manners like no one\u2019s else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon \u2018lay-down\u2019 in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was the height of my pack.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome off it, old chap, you don\u2019t expect us to believe that; it couldn\u2019t have been the height of your pack,\u201d interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a \u2018learned beggar,\u2019 and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, so it wasn\u2019t the height of my pack, wasn\u2019t it? You measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at it as if he\u2019d have liked to put him in clink. But you needn\u2019t think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We\u2019ll see what the \u2018Capstan\u2019 has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he\u2019ll say nothing, but you may be sure he won\u2019t be pleased. But there\u2019s nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he\u2019s got thirty of \u2019em and more at home, at his house in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you hear that, old man? From our blasted corporal-dog?\u201d asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did I hear it? From his batman; what d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Now you\u2019re talking. That\u2019s a chap who knows when he\u2019s well off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should say so! He\u2019s got more in his pocket than I have, certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. He wasn\u2019t getting his grub properly, he says. Along comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: \u2018I want him to be properly fed, d\u2019you hear,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I don\u2019t care what it costs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of Bergotte\u2019s novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of a welcome\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At seven o\u2019clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert\u2019s garrison. But a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things. And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. The life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magician\u2019s wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. Whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been as far wrong over direction as over distance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the \u2018everlasting fire,\u2019 an influx (worthy of some Numbering of the People Before Bethlehem such as the old Flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where \u2014 for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when I arrived \u2014 they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers\u2019 plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went straight \u2014 at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues \u2014 towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in \u2018primitive\u2019 paintings, with pointed ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup\u2019s table was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am going to say, but I shan\u2019t be a second. I keep on forgetting to ask you when I\u2019m in the barracks; isn\u2019t that Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s photograph that you have on your table?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; my good aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that she was; I\u2019d forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they\u2019re looking at us; another time will do; it isn\u2019t at all important.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right; go on as long as you like. They can wait.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no; I do want to be polite to them; they\u2019re so nice; besides, it doesn\u2019t really matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know that worthy Oriane, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018worthy Oriane,\u2019 as he might have said, \u2018that good Oriane,\u2019 did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018excellent,\u2019 \u2018worthy\u2019 are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative \u2018that,\u2019 indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. The word \u2018good\u2019 does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon \u201cDo you see much of her?\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on her for months,\u201d or \u201cI shall be seeing her on Tuesday,\u201d or \u201cShe must be getting on, now, you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because we\u2019re living in her house now, in Paris, and I\u2019ve been hearing the most astounding things\u201d (I should have been hard put to it to say what) \u201cabout her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, don\u2019t you know, from a \u2014 how shall I put it \u2014 from a Balzacian point of view; but you\u2019re so clever you can see what I mean; I don\u2019t need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn\u2019t any idea that I know you, has she?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say; I haven\u2019t seen her since the summer, because I haven\u2019t had any leave since she\u2019s been in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was going to say is this: I\u2019ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same she\u2019s by no means stupid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know that, as a rule, I don\u2019t care about your advertising the good opinion you\u2019re kind enough to hold of me; I\u2019m not conceited. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could let her know \u2014 if you would even exaggerate a trifle \u2014 what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I will, if that\u2019s all you want me to do; it\u2019s not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if that\u2019s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I\u2019m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it\u2019s so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to frame \u2014 with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so forth \u2014 questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, I\u2019m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn\u2019t discuss the things that will give one\u2019s friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn\u2019t want any explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot only should I have done it, I will do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNext time I\u2019m in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shall see; I dare say she won\u2019t want to see me, though. I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t say that; it\u2019s everything in the world, because now I can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a discussion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew Robert: \u201cBut, I say, we mustn\u2019t keep them waiting any longer, and I\u2019ve mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but I\u2019m afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we were to call each other tu?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of happiness!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you \u2014 tu I mean; you begin first \u2014 ever so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn\u2019t do anything about Mme. de Guermantes if you\u2019d rather not, this is quite enough for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can do both.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, Robert! Listen to me a minute,\u201d I said to him later while we were at dinner. \u201cOh, it\u2019s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, I can\u2019t think why \u2014 you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite sure you know who\u2019 I mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, what do you take me for, a village idiot?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to give me her photograph, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I should have to ask her permission first,\u201d was his answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this I hated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I was touched to see how differently Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter\u2019s responses and to the attitude of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once, remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: \u201cYou told me that before, at Balbec.\u201d I was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten it for the moment,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut you\u2019ll remember as I go on.\u201d \u201cNo, really; I swear you\u2019re mistaken. You\u2019ve never told me. Do go on.\u201d And throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the stuff of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a \u2018mentality,\u2019 as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup\u2019s cousins had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as Victor Hugo\u2019s or Alfred de Vigny\u2019s, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fellow? Oh, he\u2019s not like Saint-Loup, he\u2019s a regular devil,\u201d my new friend informed me; \u201che\u2019s not even straight about it. At first, he used to say: \u2018Just wait a little, there\u2019s a man I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision.\u2019 But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; I don\u2019t know what to think of him now). His family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d I suggested, turning half towards Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, \u201cthat the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One is the man of one\u2019s idea. There are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: \u201cDuroc! Duroc all over!\u201d I had no idea what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: \u201cGibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards.\u201d And to me: \u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd as an idea,\u201d I went on, \u201cis a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished, \u201cThat\u2019s one in the eye for you, my boys,\u201d exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a tight-rope. \u201cWhat were you going to say, Gibergue?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve often thought so myself,\u201d replied Saint-Loup; \u201cthey have several points in common, but you\u2019ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn\u2019t got.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: \u201cYou\u2019re the cleverest man I know, do you hear?\u201d He corrected himself, and added: \u201cYou and Elstir. \u2014 You don\u2019t mind my bracketing him with you, I hope. You understand \u2014 punctiliousness. It\u2019s like this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: \u2018You are the greatest novelist of the century \u2014 you and Stendhal.\u2019 Excessive punctiliousness, don\u2019t you know, and at heart an immense admiration. No? You don\u2019t admit Stendhal?\u201d he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. \u201cOh, good! I see you\u2019re on my side; Bloch can\u2019t stand Stendhal. I think it\u2019s idiotic of him. The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don\u2019t you think? I am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in theChartreuse, answer me?\u201d he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. \u201cMosca? Fabrice?\u201d I answered timidly that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was going on to explain: \u201cBut Mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic,\u201d I heard Robert cry: \u201cBravo!\u201d actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: \u201cOh, perfect! Admirable! You really are astounding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all Robert\u2019s friends and to Robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me \u201ceven from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d I knew that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. However this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him \u2014 in the tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain Israelites \u2014 that their colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism \u2014 to a certain kind of Dreyfusism, at least \u2014 the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment; \u201cfor he\u2019s a sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,\u201d he turned to me, \u201cMajor Duroc, the lecturer on military history I was telling you about; there\u2019s a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so I\u2019m told. And I should have been surprised to hear that he wasn\u2019t, for he\u2019s not only a brilliantly clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of Saint-Loup\u2019s faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. \u201cIt is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive me an example or two, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not very easy to explain,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in. \u201cYou read, let us say, that this or that Corps has tried . . . but before we go any further, the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. If it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy\u2019s, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. You can understand that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical context,\u201d he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. \u201cWhile the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which was a classic feint in Napoleon\u2019s wars.) On the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has been it will continue to be. A painter doesn\u2019t make a studio out of any old room; so you don\u2019t make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But, once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi, Leipzig, Cannae. I can\u2019t say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commander\u2019s part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae. Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that\u2019s a thing that will crop up if there\u2019s ever another war. It\u2019s no more obsolete than the Iliad. I must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy. They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in my life at Donci\u00e8res, with regard to these officers whom I used to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, Legrandin\u2019s brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left Donci\u00e8res I should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou interest me \u2014 I beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously,\u201d I said to Saint-Loup, \u201cbut tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied. I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can\u2019t tell you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon\u2019s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his divination \u2014 like Mme. de Th\u00e8bes (you follow me?)\u2014 which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I\u2019ve been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal \u2014 no, I know you\u2019re not well, I apologise! \u2014 well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it doesn\u2019t much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician Poincar\u00e9 is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the Field Service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSaint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next Field Service will shew signs of this evolution,\u201d put in my other neighbour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine,\u201d said Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. \u201cPerhaps I may have underestimated the importance of the rules; I don\u2019t know. They do change, that must be admitted. But in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you,\u201d he remarked to me. \u201cAfter all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past. With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be so touchy,\u201d I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. \u201cI was listening to you quite eagerly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak,\u201d his friend went on, \u201cI shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Froeschviller and Wissembourg.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has brains,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme. de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am jealous, furious,\u201d Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which I had been having with his friend. \u201cIs it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? Well, I suppose he\u2019s everything now, and no one else is to have a look in!\u201d Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, \u201cthat the influence of environment is not so important as people think . . . \u201d I intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse myself by adding: \u201cAs, in fact, I was saying the other day . . . \u201d But I had reckoned without the reverse side of Robert\u2019s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory, Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; environment is of no importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe real influence is that of one\u2019s intellectual environment! One is the man of one\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll men with similar ideas are alike,\u201d he informed me, with a challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not arrive at Saint-Loup\u2019s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one\u2019s entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one\u2019s body. Only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: \u201cPerhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me: \u2018Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here.\u2019\u201d It was not in the firmament alone that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte\u2019s account, or else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to myself: \u201cA fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de Guermantes.\u201d A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. One day I said to myself: \u201cPerhaps there will be a letter to-night;\u201d and on entering the dining-room I found courage to ask Saint-Loup:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have had any news from Paris?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he replied gloomily; \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at Donci\u00e8res, or have sailed for the Indies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. But what a torture \u2014 keener than that of having to keep silence \u2014 to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! Robert asked himself: \u201cWhat can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me.\u201d And he reproached himself. Thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: \u201cThe letter! The letter!\u201d After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at Donci\u00e8res, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a lady\u2019s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, Robert\u2019s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Donci\u00e8res, no longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: \u201cI hear her; you shan\u2019t . . . you shan\u2019t. . . . \u201d He awoke. He had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was an idiotic dream,\u201d he concluded, still quite breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at Easter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shan\u2019t be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo Balbec? But you didn\u2019t go there till August.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know; but next year they\u2019re making me go there earlier, for my health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. \u201cShe is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she is a sublime creature. You can\u2019t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls\u2019 Day at Bruges. \u2018Nice\u2019 of her, don\u2019t you think? If you ever do meet her you\u2019ll see what I mean; she has a greatness. . . . \u201d And, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: \u201cThere is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the poet merging into the priest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by Elstir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of Japanese art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which Elstir\u2019s pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me of his lady\u2019s projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, if you don\u2019t mind. Just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the painter I met at Balbec?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou remember how much I admired his work?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI do, quite well; and the letter we sent him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, one of the reasons \u2014 not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason \u2014 why I should like to meet the said lady \u2014 you do know who\u2019 I mean, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I do. How involved you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by Elstir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, I never knew that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cElstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldn\u2019t you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she won\u2019t refuse, and then ask her if she\u2019ll let me come and see the picture without you, since you won\u2019t be there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll answer for her; I\u2019ll make a special point of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope it\u2019s not your departure that you two are plotting together,\u201d one of Robert\u2019s friends said to me. \u201cYou know, if Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn\u2019t make any difference, we shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but we\u2019ll do all we can to make you forget his absence.\u201d As a matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert\u2019s mistress would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under Napoleon III\u2019s barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the hairdresser, through whose books the Prince\u2019s account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. Having learned of Saint-Loup\u2019s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man\u2019s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barber\u2019s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to Robert again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at Donci\u00e8res, or if I should come there again at any time, even although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy on earth,\u201d they went on, after insisting that I should stay, \u201cdon\u2019t you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! Besides you\u2019re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. If, in the place of one of the generals whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as Galliffet or N\u00e9grier, one of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends, with a contemptuous: \u201cBut N\u00e9grier is one of the feeblest of our general officers,\u201d put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. \u201cBetter even than N\u00e9grier? But in what respect; give me an example?\u201d I should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d\u2019Etat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself was \u2014 he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern \u2014 not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been confirmed by the Emperor \u2014 one of what were known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as \u2018touched-up\u2019 Counts \u2014 and who had besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 and was a nephew of the Sovereign\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I, whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain\u2019s placid countenance, one caught a trace of Napoleon I\u2014 if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask \u2014 the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by Marshal X\u2014 \u2014 confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at Donci\u00e8res, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain\u2019s table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger\u2019s name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him \u2018my dear fellow.\u2019 Belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the Prince de Borodino \u2014 not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally \u2014 regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies, and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a Fould\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of Donci\u00e8res, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-major\u2019s office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Mass\u00e9na. When he chose the cloth for his squadron\u2019s breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men\u2019s rations. And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue S\u00e8vres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the Prince had at Donci\u00e8res, it may be as well to add these few words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officer\u2019s wife sang like a Conservatoire medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtal\u00e8s, and the Murats, and people like that. \u201cBut,\u201d they said to themselves, \u201che\u2019s just a captain, after all; he\u2019s only too glad to get us to come. Still, he\u2019s a real friend, you know.\u201d But when M. de Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the Donci\u00e8res theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between Paris and Donci\u00e8res, she might make use of it to speak to me. In short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmother\u2019s case, Paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke \u2014 occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit \u2014 the Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: \u201cI hear you!\u201d; the ever infuriated servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound \u2014 the sound of distance overcome \u2014 and the voice of the dear one speaks to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. A real presence indeed that voice so near \u2014 in actual separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This afternoon, alas, at Donci\u00e8res, the miracle did not occur. When I reached the post office, my grandmother\u2019s call had already been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost \u2014 more than any but a few human voices can ever have been \u2014 of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Donci\u00e8res altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when I should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). \u201cGranny!\u201d I cried to her, \u201cGranny!\u201d and would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. \u201cSpeak to me!\u201d but then it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went on vainly repeating: \u201cGranny, Granny!\u201d as Orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was Captain de Borodino\u2019s nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter\u2019s distant passage. And yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert\u2019s brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between Donci\u00e8res and Paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the truth of what you\u2019re saying, or that you aren\u2019t thinking of leaving us just yet,\u201d said Saint-Loup, smiling; \u201cbut pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there\u2019s a risk of my not seeing you; I\u2019m going out to luncheon, I\u2019ve got leave from the Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house I\u2019m going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word \u2018trunks\u2019 recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night. Finally I got my connexion. \u201cIs that you, Granny?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, with a strong English accent, answered: \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know your voice.\u201d Neither did I recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. And then all was explained. The young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the \u2018old soldiers,\u2019 who were watching the regiment parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any chance?\u201d I asked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s gone on parade, sir,\u201d said the old soldier\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never saw him,\u201d said the graduate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never saw him,\u201d exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, \u201cyou never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure he\u2019s cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that, officer\u2019s cloth, my word!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you\u2019re a wonder, you are; officer\u2019s cloth,\u201d replied the young graduate, who, reported \u2018sick in quarters,\u2019 was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. \u201cThis officer\u2019s cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir?\u201d asked the old soldier angrily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches\u2019 being made of officer\u2019s cloth, but, being a Breton, coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden, having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying \u2018Sir?\u2019 to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! It is cloth like that,\u201d he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. \u201cAh! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it is, officer\u2019s cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing, if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it\u2019s because I know, I should think.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, then;\u201d replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. \u201cKeep your hair on, old boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere, look, there\u2019s the Capstan coming along. No, but just look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he\u2019s hot stuff, he is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of myself \u2014 thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one\u2019s own absence \u2014 there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say \u201cHe\u2019s begun to age a good deal,\u201d for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: \u201cI will answer for her.\u201d And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person\u2019s nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with the actions which before our mind\u2019s eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the Elstirs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to have gone in and said how d\u2019ye do to him, on my return from Donci\u00e8res, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Fran\u00e7oise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a little time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my chimney \u2014 instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea \u2014 the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I realised this. Similarly, one New Year\u2019s afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter\u2019s brush. And when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity. After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. \u201cBut, after all, the streets are public.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking. Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening . . . to a fresh doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen \u2014 and quite useless \u2014 delicacy of perception to seize them all. Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn\u2019t,\u201d he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. \u201cShe\u2019s not my old Oriane any longer, they\u2019ve gone and changed her. I assure you, it\u2019s not worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too great a compliment. You wouldn\u2019t care to meet my cousin Poictiers?\u201d he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. \u201cQuite an intelligent young woman, she is; you\u2019d like her. She\u2019s married to my cousin, the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. I\u2019ve told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see her. She\u2019s much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too. Really a nice person, don\u2019t you know, really a good sort.\u201d These were expressions recently \u2014 and all the more ardently \u2014 taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. \u201cI don\u2019t go so far as to say she\u2019s a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: \u2018If he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil\u2019s Isle.\u2019 You see what I mean, don\u2019t you? And then she\u2019s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; she\u2019s given orders that they\u2019re never to be sent in by the servants\u2019 stair, when they come to the house. She\u2019s a very good sort, I assure you. The real reason why Oriane doesn\u2019t like her is that she feels she\u2019s the cleverer of the two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the Guermantes footmen \u2014 who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of Saint-Loup\u2019s visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way Fran\u00e7oise had of saying not: \u201cI have been to see my brother,\u201d or \u201cI have been to see my niece,\u201d but \u201cI have been to see the brother,\u201d \u201cI just looked in as I passed to bid good day to the niece\u201d (or \u201cto my niece the butcheress\u201d). As for her daughter, Fran\u00e7oise would have been glad to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of \u201cthe Intran.\u201d She was still less willing to go to Franchise\u2019s sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for \u201cmountains,\u201d said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, \u201caren\u2019t really interesting.\u201d She could not make Up her mind to go back to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, where \u201cthe people are so stupid,\u201d where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say \u201cWhy, it\u2019s never poor Bazireau\u2019s daughter?\u201d She would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had \u201ctasted the life of Paris,\u201d and Fran\u00e7oise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new Parisian when she said: \u201cVery well, mother, if you don\u2019t get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had turned chilly again. \u201cGo out? What for? To catch your death?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt L\u00e9onie \u2014 a natural philosopher \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: \u201cIt is the remnant of the wrath of God!\u201d But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A. J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I never knew anything about it. It seems she\u2019s a delightful person, a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnother thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only he\u2019s very proud of his name and his connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you\u2019re not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out quite a good career; it\u2019s not what I should have chosen for you, myself; but you\u2019ll be a man in no time now, we shan\u2019t always be here to look after you, and we mustn\u2019t prevent you from following your vocation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cHe tells me, she\u2019s his aunt; \u2018Viparisi,\u2019 he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she\u2019s an extraordinarily able woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit,\u201d my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the Marquise\u2019s intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed Fran\u00e7oise to lick the envelopes for her. As for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I eventually did\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the Ambassador\u2019s support would be worth many votes to him at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois\u2019s support, he was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father\u2019s candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to him all the more probable since the Ambassador\u2019s willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides, at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: \u201cMy dear, I really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she won\u2019t stay long;\u201d and even: \u201cListen, dear, I am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you.\u201d He would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met Mme. Sazerat in some one\u2019s house. She did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all one\u2019s relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat, alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a friend of M. M\u00e9line, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to take me to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, where I hoped, though I had not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which Aim\u00e9 had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec, to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of travel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the house early, with Fran\u00e7oise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. Fran\u00e7oise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching Saint-Loup\u2019s, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! So it\u2019s you,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201ca man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world, I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere \u2014 which I am unable to breathe \u2014 of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I can see it all, you frequent the \u2018light hearts,\u2019 the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet. Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de si\u00e8cle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: \u2018Do this and ye shall live.\u2019 Farewell, Friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor\u2019s office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the \u2018follies\u2019 of the stewards and favourites of the great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that I had seen, formed great quadrilaterals \u2014 separated by low walls \u2014 of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the Army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general affection called love must have forced him \u2014 as it forces all men \u2014 to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really \u2014 he thought) to leave him. \u201cIf she is nice to me to-day,\u201d he confided to me, \u201cI am going to give her something that she\u2019ll like. It\u2019s a necklace she saw at Boucheron\u2019s. It\u2019s rather too much for me just at present \u2014 thirty thousand francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I don t believe that is true, really, but I wasn\u2019t taking any risks, so I\u2019ve arranged with Boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you\u2019re going to meet her; she\u2019s nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know,\u201d (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her all the more) \u201cwhat she has got is a marvellous judgment; she\u2019ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the things she\u2019ll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; there\u2019s really something about her that\u2019s quite Pythian.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; I can see you\u2019d rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it,\u201d said Robert, \u201cso just wait for me here, will you; my friend\u2019s house is quite close, I will go and fetch her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann\u2019s park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun\u2019s face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun\u2019s rays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once \u2018Rachel when from the Lord,\u2019 her who, but a few years since \u2014 women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change \u2014 used to say to the procuress: \u201cTo-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when they had \u2018come round\u2019 for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the \u2018anyone,\u2019 she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent woman\u2019s precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one\u2019s chest, never stopping in the process unless the \u2018some one,\u2019 not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient\u2019s catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make \u2014 out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more \u2014 the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these two elements separately (because I had known \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he not given to learn them, without avail!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl\u2019s face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than one\u2019s family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one\u2019s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one\u2019s chances of Platonic love. And it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. As for Rachel\u2019s favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge \u2014 since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law \u2014 from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019\u2014 who seemed to me a small matter \u2014 it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the Magdalene\u2019s when, in another garden, she saw a human form and \u2018thought it was the gardener.\u2019 Treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress. We cut across the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew me a little way in front to explain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should have liked it if you and I could have been alone together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt\u2019s. But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, don\u2019t you know, I hadn\u2019t the heart to refuse her. You\u2019ll like her, however, she\u2019s literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides it\u2019s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little \u2018tarts\u2019 like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: \u201cHello, Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train, and there\u2019s room for one more. Come on. We\u2019re all going to the rink,\u201d and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. They were two poor little \u2018tarts\u2019 with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little \u2018tarts\u2019 in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own Rachel, the little \u2018tart\u2019 Rachel, the real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the \u2018tart\u2019 was more real than the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on Rachel\u2019s part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say \u2014 and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands \u2014 that this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one\u2019s own eyes and in other people\u2019s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two \u2018tarts\u2019 to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; Rachel\u2019s magnificent pearls reminded Robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto \u2014 save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle of an impressionist painter \u2014 and the train began to move\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, by the way, quite true that she was \u2018literary.\u2019 She never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! If you could live with me for a year, we\u2019d see a fine change. I should keep you on water and you\u2019d be ever so much better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight you are. Let\u2019s begin now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you know quite well I have to work all day!\u201d For she took her art very seriously. \u201cBesides, what would your people say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. Tears sprang to the young woman\u2019s eyes; I had been rash enough to refer to Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe poor martyr!\u201d she almost sobbed; \u201cit will be the death of him in that dreadful place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t upset yourself, Z\u00e9zette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit they\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut long before then he\u2019ll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony he must be going through; that\u2019s what makes my heart bleed. And would you believe that Robert\u2019s mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the Devil\u2019s Isle, even if he is innocent; isn\u2019t it appalling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, it\u2019s absolutely true, she does say that,\u201d Robert assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s my mother, I\u2019ve no fault to find with her, but it\u2019s quite clear she hasn\u2019t got a sensitive nature, like Z\u00e9zette.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be \u2018such a pleasure\u2019 always ended in trouble. For as soon as Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf\u00e9, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, Aim\u00e9, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aim\u00e9 having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. Aim\u00e9 inquired after my grandmother\u2019s health; I asked for news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. Robert\u2019s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. But Aim\u00e9\u2018s sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of Prince Eug\u00e8ne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most, some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. And yet Aim\u00e9 must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnything specially interesting about that waiter, Z\u00e9zette?\u201d he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aim\u00e9. \u201cOne would think you were studying the part.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken; I haven\u2019t said anything, I\u2019m sure. But I have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec (otherwise I shouldn\u2019t give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesn\u2019t walk the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, \u201cAh! That is good!\u201d one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: \u201cYes, as a sensation I call it distinctly good.\u201d But what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration \u2014 against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her \u2014 the defence of Berma, saying: \u201cOh, no, she\u2019s a wonderful person, really. Of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don\u2019t correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she\u2019s such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn\u2019t care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind.\u201d (Our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out one\u2019s thumb. But the \u2018charming quality of mind\u2019 is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because I believed \u2014 quite mistakenly, as it happened \u2014 that it was she who was inferior to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone\u2019s conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters\u2019 faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive Robert away so that she might be alone with Aim\u00e9, Rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cZ\u00e9zette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that,\u201d said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, \u201cif you must make a scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point a messenger came up to tell Aim\u00e9 that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; you see!\u201d he said to me in a low voice, \u201cmy family hunt me down even here. Will you, please \u2014 I can\u2019t very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and he\u2019s certain to give us away \u2014 ask him not to go to the carriage. He can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn\u2019t know me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I\u2019m not known here, he\u2019ll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. Really, it\u2019s pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, indeed! So it\u2019s the young man over there, now, is it? Thank you for telling me; it\u2019s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one\u2019s meals! Don\u2019t listen to him, please; he\u2019s rather cross to-day, and, you know,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201che just says it because he thinks it smart, that it\u2019s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Z\u00e9zette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine you\u2019re making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I think he\u2019s charming; for one thing, he\u2019s got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women \u2014 you can feel he must love them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can at least keep quiet until I\u2019ve left the room, if you have lost your senses,\u201d cried Robert. \u201cWaiter, my things.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know whether I was expected to follow him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, I want to be alone,\u201d he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aim\u00e9 and asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I thought of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAn amusing expression, hasn\u2019t he? Do you know what I should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s silly of Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it\u2019s only just what comes into my head, that\u2019s all; Robert has nothing to worry about.\u201d She was still gazing at Aim\u00e9. \u201cDo look, what dark eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They were drinking champagne. \u201cHallo, you!\u201d she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin\u2019s words had had no effect on me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: \u201cI have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young woman\u2019s company are not wasted, since I have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne.\u201d I told myself this because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication \u2014 and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart \u2014 lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I\u2019ve forgotten the story,\u201d and he watched her furtively\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, there\u2019s nothing more than what you\u2019ve just said.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a bore you are. Then tell her about Fran\u00e7oise in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. She\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do! Bobby is always talking about Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d And taking Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: \u201cHallo, you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself, pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian\u2019s face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us \u2014 like the dissolution of a dear friend \u2014 begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than I had paid to my grandmother\u2019s sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the opening scene of this afternoon\u2019s performance interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had one of those faces to which distance \u2014 and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre \u2014 gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of Rachel\u2019s attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not my case but it had been Saint-Loup\u2019s when he first saw her on the stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm \u2014 that in which she lived \u2014 from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in Robert\u2019s memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one\u2019s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI did come to say good-bye to you the day I left Donci\u00e8res; I\u2019ve not had an opportunity to mention it. I waved to you in the street.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t speak about it,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was so sorry. I passed you just outside the barracks, but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. On the other hand \u2014 as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold \u2014 on this face, so smooth a surface until now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by Goethe in Wilhelm Meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one\u2019s eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might look the other way,\u201d he warned her gloomily. \u201cYou know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and they\u2019re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you\u2019ve taken notice of them. Besides, you know very well you\u2019ve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. You\u2019ll be missing your call again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group of men \u2014 journalists \u2014 noticing the look of fury on Saint-Loup\u2019s face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but I know him; he\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d cried Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. \u201cLook how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, that\u2019s too lovely, the way he copies himself,\u201d she cried, clapping her hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI implore you, my dearest girl,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, \u201cdo not make a scene here, I can\u2019t stand it; I swear, if you say another word I won\u2019t go with you to your room, I shall walk straight out; come, don\u2019t be so naughty. . . . You oughtn\u2019t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it\u2019ll make you ill,\u201d he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our Balbec days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! What a good thing it would be if you did go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI warn you, if I do I shan\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s more than I should venture to hope.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Well, that doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. You gave me your promise; I ought to have known you\u2019d never keep it. You want the whole world to know you\u2019re made of money, but I\u2019m not a money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I know some one else who\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo one else can possibly give it to you; I\u2019ve told Boucheron he\u2019s to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone else have it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, trying to blackmail me, you\u2019ve arranged everything, I see. That\u2019s what they mean by Marsantes, Mater Semita, it smells of the race,\u201d retorted Rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for Semita means \u2018path\u2019 and not \u2018Semite,\u2019 but one which the Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word \u2018Jew\u2019 to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her connexion with the L\u00e9vy-Mirepoix family. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t the last of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn\u2019t binding. You have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of it and he\u2019ll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You\u2019ll hear from me before long; don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at Balbec: \u201cIn that way I keep a hold over her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean about the necklace. I made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, it\u2019s only natural, surely, that I shouldn\u2019t give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. You can\u2019t seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I\u2019m always telling you that I\u2019m only a poor devil without a cent to my name. It\u2019s foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well that my one interest in life is yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, yes, please go on,\u201d she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning to watch the dancer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIsn\u2019t he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me couldn\u2019t do the things he\u2019s doing now.\u201d She went closer to him and, pointing to Robert\u2019s furious face: \u201cLook, he\u2019s hurt,\u201d she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn\u2019t matter what you do \u2014 in a week you\u2019ll be giving anything to get me back \u2014 I shan\u2019t come; it\u2019s a clean cut, do you hear, it\u2019s irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy,\u201d he went on, to me, \u201cyou oughtn\u2019t to stand about here, I tell you, it will make you cough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands?\u201d she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. \u201cYou look just like one yourself, I\u2019m sure I could have a wonderful time with you and a girl I know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no rule against smoking that I know of; if people aren\u2019t well, they have only to stay at home,\u201d said the journalist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! Do stop! You\u2019ll make me quite mad,\u201d she cried to him. \u201cThen there will be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, sir, you are not very civil,\u201d observed Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed \u2014 without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante \u2014 after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another\u2019s blood. But what I could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: \u201cGood heavens, I believe the curtain\u2019s going up; we shan\u2019t get into our seats.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the \u2018play\u2019 necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. The journalist\u2019s friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker\u2019s brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend\u2019s not having shared their several emotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, didn\u2019t it strike you? You must be going blind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I say is that you\u2019re a pack of curs,\u201d growled the journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought \u2014 but they did not think of it \u2014 to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: \u201cWhat\u2019s all the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don\u2019t take the bit in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which Robert\u2019s love for \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 was based; I was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a \u2018gymnastic\u2019 pace to overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup\u2019s face and body, a flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They were merely, however, Saint-Loup\u2019s pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this \u2014 to all appearance ideal and decorative \u2014 arrangement. But this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend could not get over the audacity of this \u2018clique\u2019 who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris. And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup\u2019s arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be left alone for a while. After a moment\u2019s silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis. He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy \u2014 of more than twenty years\u2019 standing \u2014 between Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been responsible for the lady\u2019s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That \u2018sharp tongue\u2019 which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which \u2014 giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation \u2014 Mme. de Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word \u2018restraint\u2019 is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves \u2014 on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces \u2014 true artistic qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-Pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the Memoirs which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s Memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors\u2019 or solicitors\u2019 wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme. de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a \u2018complete woman.\u2019 It is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for one\u2019s own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one\u2019s social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women\u2019s lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme. Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was \u2014 to use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann \u2014\u2018cutting\u2019 the Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie had once said to her: \u201cYou are just like a daughter to me.\u201d But such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could remember the Queen\u2019s using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme. Leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s receptions were, as the readers of her Memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw those \u2014 gifts from the sitters themselves \u2014 of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist\u2019s counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the Memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly, a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians, the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena\u2019s, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound \u2018salaams,\u2019 completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually \u2018in\u2019 society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille\u2019s nose than of Solomon\u2019s. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one of Decamps\u2019s Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews, Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. We know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which \u2014 up to the present, at any rate \u2014 the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room taken photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the same image \u2014 so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity \u2014 which we find in spirit photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these words \u2014 the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch: \u201cTake care of my top hat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Ministers, my dear sir,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: \u201cnobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time, but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the Duchesse de Berry. \u2018It will give me pleasure, Florimond,\u2019 said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M. Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it \u2018Tea\u2019 or \u2018Dancing\u2019 or \u2018Music.\u2019 But if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M. Decazes at his ball. . . . Yes, sir, I remember M. Mole very well, he was a clever man \u2014 he shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the Academy \u2014 but he was very pompous, and I can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one\u2019s hat in one\u2019s hand in one\u2019s own house,\u201d observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: \u201cThere, you see what she\u2019s like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, she\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, \u201cit was a habit M. Mole had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the King came, because the King being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAristotle tells us in the second chapter of . . . \u201d ventured M. Pierre, the historian of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people\u2019s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the latter remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. \u201cDo you know, I never knew that,\u201d as though it were strange that he should not have known it always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTalking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the librarian. \u201cHe told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had called to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must have a nerve,\u201d exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have heard so soon,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her Memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was \u2018at home,\u2019 and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her Memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author\u2019s disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis felt the sting of Mme. Leroi\u2019s opinion. But hardly anyone to-day remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been by the Due d\u2019Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert, Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories \u2014 sometimes slightly \u2018touched up\u2019\u2014 by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. And then there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. \u201cLove?\u201d she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: \u201cWhat are your views on love?\u201d\u2014\u201cLove? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about it.\u201d When she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the Memoirs of Mme. de Villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille\u2019s tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis is the cause of the Lerois\u2019 disdain, the disdain of the Lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies had her own \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019 of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one another\u2019s society. Besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies\u2019 \u2018men about town\u2019 nephews \u2014 and Saint-Loup the foremost of them \u2014 when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once \u201cI will take you to see my aunt Villeparisis,\u201d (or whichever it was) \u201cyou meet interesting people there.\u201d They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one does not tabulate the sum of a person\u2019s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which is \u2018society,\u2019 the really light women, the true Messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has written \u2014 on the early days of Lamartine \u2014 an essay that has been crowned by the French Academy. \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, Alix?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais. Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades \u2014 and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances \u2014 just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cYou see, I\u2019m nowhere near him; please understand that I\u2019m not interested \u2014 in any sense of the word, you old cat \u2014 in little boys.\u201d But when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name \u2014 she had been born a Choiseul, moreover \u2014 had a prodigious effect on me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI understand, sir, that you are thinkin\u2019 of writin\u2019 somethin\u2019 about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen. \u201cWhat is rather amusin\u2019,\u201d said our hostess, \u201cis that in these Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted. They were very close corporations.\u201d \u201cNot admit the King\u2019s daughters,\u201d cried Bloch in amazement, \u201cwhy ever not?\u201d \u201cWhy, because the House of France had not enough quartering after that low marriage.\u201d Bloch\u2019s bewilderment increased. \u201cA low marriage? The House of France? When was that?\u201d \u201cWhy, when they married into the Medicis,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural manner. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine picture, ain\u2019t it, and in a perfect state of preservation,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018My dear,\u201d put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, \u201csurely you remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on painthe Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don\u2019t remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn\u2019t you that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix\u2019s shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, I see another fine portrait,\u201d began the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, how are you?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: \u201cThat is the portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme. la Marquise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you tell him I was at home?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe heard the voices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, very well then, shew him in. It\u2019s a man who was introduced to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe told me he was very anxious to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here he\u2019s taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn\u2019t do to hurt people\u2019s feelings. Sir,\u201d she went on to me, \u201cand you, Sir,\u201d to the historian of the Fronde, \u201clet me introduce my niece, the Duchesse de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you so very much for letting me come and see you,\u201d he began, laying stress on the word \u2018very.\u2019 \u201cIt is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; I assure you that its repercussion . . . \u201d He stopped short on catching sight of me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the Maxims; it\u2019s a family picture.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. \u201cI hear all about you from Madeleine,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe was at luncheon with me to-day,\u201d said the Marquise of the Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de Villeparisis could never say that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what I had been told of his father\u2019s change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. \u201cYes, I do lead a delightful existence,\u201d Bloch assured me with a beatified smile. \u201cI have three great friends; I do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity.\u201d I fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: \u201cOh, it was nothing, really,\u201d and so forth, when, to my question: \u201cWas it a good show?\u201d put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: \u201cWhy, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn\u2019t have been better. It was really charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat you have just told us interests me enormously,\u201d said Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cfor I was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from Joubert, friends of the memery. You have never read Joubert? Oh! he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a great deal of charm all the same.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse, who was married first of all to M. de Luynes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you weren\u2019t engaged I\u2019d have sent round to ask you to come. Mme. Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by Queen Carmen Sylva in the author\u2019s presence. It was too beautiful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat treachery!\u201d thought Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cOf course that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her great days, she\u2019s a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen Sylva\u2019s poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the Inferno, by Dante. In that sort of thing she\u2019s incomparable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter would level her with the dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of Mme, de Montmorency,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s M. Legrandin,\u201d murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201che has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! Oh, but I know her quite well!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. \u201cThat is to say, I don\u2019t know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can\u2019t tell you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house, I\u2019m going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. And don\u2019t for a moment suppose that it\u2019s an easy thing to do. On the pretence that she\u2019s dying of some disease she\u2019s always at home, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, she\u2019s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s an impossible person, she talks about \u2018plumitives\u2019 and things like that.\u201d \u201cWhat does \u2018plumitive\u2019 mean?\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea!\u201d cried the Duchess in mock indignation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t speak that sort of language.\u201d And seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, \u201ceverybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But it\u2019s a dreadful word. It\u2019s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the brother, is it? I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. But after all it\u2019s not inconceivable. She has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. She\u2019s just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. Yes, I\u2019m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, we\u2019re just going to take a dish of tea,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to her niece. \u201cHelp yourself; you don\u2019t want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: \u201cWell, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when I find you here too.\u201d M. Legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d\u2019ye do to me,\u201d he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNaturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere,\u201d he went on in lower tones, \u201calthough I am perfectly free to do what I choose, still I can\u2019t behave like an absolute boor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks \u2014 which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes \u2014 was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know many of the Duchess\u2019s peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the pastry-cook\u2019s in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the Marquise\u2019s \u2018days,\u2019 at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon\u2019s outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix. With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That admirable writer G\u2014\u2014-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme. de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctor\u2019s orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes\u2019 the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Fran\u00e7oise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, \u2018the Sagante\u2019), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the Due de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess\u2019s marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with Thiers, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. They sat down to luncheon. \u201cDo you like this way of doing eggs?\u201d she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from Guermantes: \u201cGive Monsieur some more eggs,\u201d she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without \u2014 whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness \u2014 the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her. Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied\u2019s wedding, I had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes,\u201d as though it were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on your husband for some days,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u2019 well, I have seen him once, perhaps \u2014 since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi\u2019s. You wouldn\u2019t know her now, she\u2019s positively enormous; I\u2019m sure she must have something the matter with her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now she\u2019s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn\u2019t quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, she\u2019s more like a frog in an interesting condition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, that is quite clever,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece\u2019s wit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is purely arbitrary, though,\u201d answered Mme. de Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann would have done, \u201cfor I must admit I never saw a frog in the family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she\u2019s been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. I promised I\u2019d let you know in good time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: \u201cI know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night before last. Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was there. He came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was a man there who\u2019s a great deal wittier than Babal,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih M. de Br\u00e9\u00e0ut\u00e9-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. \u201cI mean M. Bergotte.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the Duchess smile, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. But above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on the evening of Ph\u00e8dre, that I had not gone up and spoken to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de Villeparisis:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is the only person I have any wish to know,\u201d went on the Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. \u201cIt would be such a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather that he didn\u2019t behave very well, he was presented to M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. \u201cHe never once said \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 to him,\u201d she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go on his knees before his Holiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of appreciating Bergotte\u2019s originality, it was a fact which I was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. Thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Comte d\u2019Argencourt, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires at the Belgian Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de Guermantes and H. H. the Due de Ch\u00e2tellerault, whom Mme. de Guermantes greeted with: \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, young Ch\u00e2tellerault,\u201d in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young Duke\u2019s mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayor\u2019s office and not knowing what to do with his hat. Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t leave them on the floor, they\u2019ll be trodden on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is that person\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked by the Baron, who had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Pierre,\u201d I whispered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre: it\u2019s his name, he\u2019s a historian, a most distinguished man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally? You don\u2019t say so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, it\u2019s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis explained. \u201cI\u2019m like you, I can never get used to it. Still, it\u2019s better than my nephew Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him if he\u2019s come to wind the clocks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Mole\u2019s hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe really is astonishing, the little Duchess,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to G\u2014\u2014. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a famous man in the room you\u2019re sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. It can\u2019t always be M. de Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d\u2019Avenel. But then it\u2019s bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday evening at the Doudeauvilles\u2019, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasn\u2019t going to be war. Really, you\u2019d have said she was a Queen, holding her circle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThose flowers are a truly celestial pink,\u201d said Legrandin, \u201cI should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. But,\u201d he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, \u201cI think I shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we don\u2019t have now, but they did it with great skill.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious theory,\u201d exclaimed Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you\u2019re painting some fine cherry blossoms \u2014 or are they may-flowers?\u201d began the historian of the Fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re apple blossom,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, addressing her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I see you\u2019re a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple blossom was over now,\u201d said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, no; far from it, it\u2019s not out yet; the trees won\u2019t be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps,\u201d said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s estates, was better informed upon country matters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt least three weeks,\u201d put in the Duchess; \u201ceven round Paris, where they\u2019re very far forward. Down in Normandy, don\u2019t you know, at his father\u2019s place,\u201d she went on, pointing to the young Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault, \u201cwhere they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they\u2019re never really pink until after the twentieth of May.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never see them,\u201d said the young Duke, \u201cbecause they give me hay fever. Such a bore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHay fever? I never heard of that before,\u201d said the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the fashionable complaint just now,\u201d the librarian informed him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat all depends, you won\u2019t get it at all, probably, if it\u2019s a good year for apples. You know Le Normand\u2019s saying: \u2018When it\u2019s a good year for apples . . . \u2019,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to give himself a Parisian air\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece, \u201cthese are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. You\u2019re surprised, I dare say, Monsieur Valm\u00e8re,\u201d she turned to the librarian, \u201cthat a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be an old woman, but I\u2019m not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a few friends,\u201d she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de Villeparisis was painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind, Marquise,\u201d said the historian, sitting down again, \u201ceven though we should have another of those Revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood \u2014 and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,\u201d he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no \u2018disaffected\u2019 person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, \u201cwith a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right.\u201d The historian of the Fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally, you have the fingers of a fairy,\u201d went on (to the Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed Bloch\u2019s clumsiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: \u201cIt\u2019s not of the slightest importance; I\u2019m not wet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes, with the injunction:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember to tell Gis\u00e8le and Berthe\u201d (the Duchesses d\u2019Auberjon and de Portefin) \u201cto be here a little before two to help me,\u201d as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister \u2014 who needed and received tactful handling \u2014 of their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five o\u2019clock tea-parties as, later on, in her Memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme. de Villeparisis \u2014 failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her \u2014 the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: \u201cIf people can\u2019t train their servants to put flowers where they won\u2019t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, it\u2019s much better not to go in for such luxuries,\u201d he muttered angrily. He was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise\u2019s drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress \u2018with pure eyes, fair as Hera,\u2019 who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady\u2019s name Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have better news,\u201d she murmured in my ear. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s quite cooled off now, and that before very long they\u2019ll be parted \u2014 in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business,\u201d she added. For Robert\u2019s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser\u2019s instance, to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad of him,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the Guermantes, even the most depraved. \u201cToo, too bad,\u201d she repeated, giving the word a trio of t\u2019s. One felt that she had no doubt of the Prince\u2019s being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness of heart was the old lady\u2019s dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: \u201cThe Prince de Borodino!\u201d\u2014 speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cdirty dog as he is, because he\u2019s so extremely well-bred. I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, they\u2019re so rare,\u201d he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. \u201cI will give you an example which I consider most striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman\u2019s name; one never does catch people\u2019s names when one\u2019s introduced to them,\u201d he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father\u2019s witticisms. \u201cDe Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI learned this,\u201d Bloch informed us, \u201cfrom the person who holds Sir Rufus\u2019s power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful individual,\u201d he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me,\u201d Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, \u201chow much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, don\u2019t you. I\u2019m interested from the Balzacian point of view. You don\u2019t happen to know what it\u2019s in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s bad for you!\u201d Bloch was downcast. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not hot in here.\u201d And breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should say. I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m simply dripping. And I have not, like the sage Antenor, son of the river Aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils.\u201d And with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: \u201cWell, if you believe it\u2019s good for you! I must say, I think you\u2019re quite wrong. It\u2019s exactly what gives you your cold.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus case. \u201cThere\u2019s a mentality at work there which I don\u2019t altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat,\u201d he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: \u201cHaven\u2019t I read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat? He\u2019s fairly paralytic now, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the old boy I\u2019ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a minute,\u201d the Marquise went on, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he can be doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: \u201cGo and tell M. de Norpois to come in\u201d she ordered him, \u201che is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything you want to know,\u201d she said gruffly to Bloch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve much of the way things are going.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that evening she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear they\u2019ve been down here bothering you. I trust things are going better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not in a hurry?\u201d she now asked Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my biliary ducts,\u201d he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s where my nephew Ch\u00e2tellerault\u2019s got to go, you must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He\u2019s a nice boy, you know,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I dare say he wouldn\u2019t care about that \u2014 I don\u2019t really know him \u2014 at least I barely know him. He is sitting over there,\u201d stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler could not have delivered his mistress\u2019s message properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: \u201cWho is that old idiot?\u201d Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch\u2019s nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cI should like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le Marquis de Norpois.\u201d She made a point, despite her casual usage of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man \u2014 which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and murmured: \u201cI am delighted . . . \u201d whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: \u201cNot at all! On the contrary, it is I who am delighted.\u201d But this ceremony, which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if it\u2019s more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus case,\u201d she went on, no more considering whether this would suit M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the Duchesse de Montmorency\u2019s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou must speak loud,\u201d she warned Bloch, \u201che\u2019s a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn\u2019t it;\u201d she raised her voice, \u201cyou knew Bismarck well?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you got anything on the stocks?\u201d M. de Norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. \u201cYou shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not to say anything against Bergotte,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelist\u2019s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at our good friend A. J.\u2018s,\u201d he went on, turning again to myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to Mme. Swann\u2019s. \u201cAnother of my great favourites,\u201d I told him, \u201cis Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable Bunch of Radishes which I remember at the Exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!\u201d And indeed, if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture I liked best, I should have named this Bunch of Radishes. \u201cA masterpiece?\u201d cried M. de Norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. \u201cIt makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch.\u201d (He was right.) \u201cIf you label a clever little thing of that sort \u2018masterpiece,\u2019 what have you got to say about H\u00e9bert\u2019s Virgin or Dagnan-Bouveret?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard you refusing to let him bring Robert\u2019s woman,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the Ambassador aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss much, she\u2019s a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides she\u2019s grotesquely ugly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?\u201d asked M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, didn\u2019t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of Paris, not that that\u2019s anything for me to be proud of,\u201d explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. \u201cHallo, I suppose I ought to be going now,\u201d she added, without moving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze \u2014 dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun \u2014 of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the \u2018bulls\u2019 which \u2018the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies\u2019 skirts and interrupting conversations. A permanent smile \u2014 suggesting a \u2018Good King of Yvetot\u2019\u2014 slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a shark\u2019s fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: \u201cHow do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;\u201d and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: \u201cHow do, my young neighbour, how\u2019s your father? What a splendid fellow he is!\u201d He made no great demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter\u2019s self-sufficiency. One could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to tell me she performed in your house?\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt asked the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes shared her aunt\u2019s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her r\u2019s like Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father\u2019s Academic chair. He tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I was going to Balbec. \u201cWhat? Going again to Balbec? Why, you\u2019re a regular globe-trotter.\u201d He listened to what I had to say. At the name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M. Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist\u2019s having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said to me with emotion, \u201cyour father must not stand. In his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. Your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is nothing to be done. Later on, I don\u2019t say. But he must wait until the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far\u00e0 da s\u00e8 of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, Principis obsta. His friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed,\u201d he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, \u201cI am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply because I am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables \u2014Arcades ambo), simply because I know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him to understand that I should not.\u201d (I seemed to discern in his eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) \u201cSo that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part.\u201d M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther Academicians as old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: \u201cAh! If it only rested with me!\u201d than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. \u201cI may tell you,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat in the best interests of you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years\u2019 time.\u201d Words which I assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought of giving the Institute an address on the price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose,\u201d the historian of that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. \u201cYou could make a considerable success of a subject like that,\u201d (which was to say, \u201cyou would give me a colossal advertisement,\u201d) he added, smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cotterd\u2019s interest: \u201cNow this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the Academy of Medicine!\u201d He had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the Ambassador\u2019s reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her at work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know who\u2019 we\u2019re talking about, Basin?\u201d the Duchess asked her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can make a pretty good guess,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! As an actress she\u2019s not, I\u2019m afraid, in what one would call the great tradition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes to M. d\u2019Argencourt \u201canything more ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, it was drolatic,\u201d put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I fail to understand,\u201d resumed the Duchess, \u201cis how in the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of course I know one mustn\u2019t discuss that sort of thing,\u201d she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. \u201cI know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. And,\u201d she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, \u201cthat is the really nice thing about love, because it\u2019s what makes it so \u2018mysterious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that\u2019s a bit beyond me,\u201d said the Comte d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, yes, it\u2019s a very mysterious thing, love,\u201d declared the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something more than just noise in the Walk\u00fcre. \u201cAfter all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think,\u201d she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. \u201cAfter all, one never knows anything, does one?\u201d she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. \u201cBesides, one understands, doesn\u2019t one; one simply can\u2019t explain other people\u2019s choices in love.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup\u2019s choice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll the same, don\u2019t you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who\u2019s simply silly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup\u2019s name mentioned and gathering that he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La poulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019 a La Boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, though, what about Swann?\u201d objected M. d\u2019Argencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin\u2019s speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Swann\u2019s case was quite different,\u201d the Duchess protested. \u201cIt was a great surprise, I admit, because she\u2019s just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, oh!\u201d muttered Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she\u2019s horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so unnecessary.\u201d The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as M. d\u2019Argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words \u2014 either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh \u2014 and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. She went on: \u201cYes, really, it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and I can quite understand anybody\u2019s falling in love with her, but if you saw Robert\u2019s girl, I assure you, you\u2019d simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody\u2019s going to quote Augier at me: \u2018What matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk?\u2019 Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasn\u2019t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a mere nothing \u2014 what? \u2014 and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you\u2019d heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I\u2019m sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the Seven Princesses.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeven Princesses! Dear, dear, what a snob she must be!\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt. \u201cBut, wait a minute, why, I know the whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn\u2019t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?\u201d asked the historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you know the Seven Princesses, do you?\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI congratulate you! I only know one, but she\u2019s quite enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. If they are all like the one I\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a goose!\u201d I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. \u201cTo think that\u2019s the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really, I\u2019m too kind. Well, it\u2019s my turn now not to want to see her.\u201d Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it was like,\u201d the Duchess went on; \u201cyou simply couldn\u2019t help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the other way, I\u2019m sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and I don\u2019t quite see Marie-Aynard approving of that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the name given in the family to Robert\u2019s mother, Mme. de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, also a Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or Marie-Hedwige\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair!\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. \u201cJust imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didn\u2019t open her mouth \u2014 I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 for a good five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I say,\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said \u2014 I give you her actual words \u2014\u2018One ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself.\u2019 When you think of it, that really is monumental.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I understood she wasn\u2019t at all bad at reciting poetry,\u201d said one of the two young men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe hasn\u2019t the ghost of a notion what poetry is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t need to listen to her to tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. I knew at once that she couldn\u2019t have any talent when I saw those lilies!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everybody laughed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope, my dear aunt, you aren\u2019t angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I\u2019ve come to ask your forgiveness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at my table, if you\u2019re hungry. \u2014 Come along, M. Valm\u00e8re, you\u2019re the daughter of the house,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis gentleman makes you an admirable daughter,\u201d commented M. d\u2019Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s little joke in circulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou perform your functions admirably,\u201d said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, my dear aunt,\u201d M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cwho was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but I couldn\u2019t place him at all; you know I never can remember names, it\u2019s such a nuisance,\u201d he added, in a tone of satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Legrandin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a Grandin de l\u2019Epervier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cno relation at all. These are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they\u2019d be only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, Basin, you know quite well who\u2019 my aunt means,\u201d cried the Duchess indignantly. \u201cHe\u2019s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw a person I didn\u2019t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; I couldn\u2019t very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, she\u2019s not in the least like a cow,\u201d he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew that his wife\u2019s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI admit she doesn\u2019t look like a cow, she looks like a dozen,\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI assure you, I didn\u2019t know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half a mind to say: \u2018Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you can\u2019t possibly know me, because you\u2019re a herd of cattle,\u2019 but after racking my brains over her I came to the conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: \u2018Your Royal Highness\u2019 and using the third person to a herd of cattle. The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I don\u2019t know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn\u2019t think what they were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but \u2018Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer\u2019 with some address or other which I\u2019ve forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it\u2019s a great distinction to look like a Queen,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don\u2019t amount to much,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, sir,\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201chave you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit. Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing. As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador\u2019s geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered Bloch\u2019s vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch\u2019s literary work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not of your age,\u201d the former Ambassador told him, \u201cand I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a Government.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating M. de Norpois\u2019s own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day\u2019s proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. To Bloch\u2019s questions M. de Norpois replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly \u2014 I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut,\u201d exclaimed Bloch, \u201cthe divine Athena, daughter of Zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. And they are fighting against one another like two lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are those two palavering about over there?\u201d M. de Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois and Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Dreyfus case.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. And as he\u2019s coming up for election next week . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d broke in the Duchess, \u201cif they\u2019re all like Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent back to Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and Jerusalem? It\u2019s nothing to do with that. But,\u201d he went on in a gentler tone, \u201cyou will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What can you expect, my dear, it\u2019s got \u2019em on the raw, those fellows; they\u2019re all over it. I don\u2019t blame them, either; personally, you know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of \u2018Marquis de Saint-Loup\u2019 one isn\u2019t a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes uttered the words: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d with some emphasis. He knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Duc de Guermantes,\u201d whereas an educated man, a Swann, a Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet \u2018aristocratic\u2019 be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes had picked up \u2018when one goes by the name,\u2019 he had probably not the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say, referring to himself, that \u201cthe most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without \u2014 namely Bloch,\u201d and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so I was often to hear this \u2018when one goes by the name.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat can one expect,\u201d the Duke went on, \u201cwith the influence he\u2019s come under; it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill it is rather comic,\u201d suggested the Duchess, \u201cwhen you think of his mother\u2019s attitude, how she bores us to tears with her Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, morning, noon and night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, but there\u2019s not only his mother to be thought of, you can\u2019t humbug us like that. There\u2019s a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She has passed on her state of mind to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind,\u201d said the librarian, who was Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. \u201cThey say \u2018mentality.\u2019 It means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you\u2019re talking about. It is the very latest expression just now, the \u2018last word\u2019 as people say.\u201d Meanwhile, having heard Bloch\u2019s name, he was watching him question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to the \u2018Syndicate.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Duke, \u201c\u2018mentality,\u2019 you say; I must make a note of that; I shall use it some day.\u201d This was no figure of speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such \u2018references\u2019 which he used to consult before dinner-parties. \u201cI like \u2018mentality.\u2019 There are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read somewhere the other day that some writer was \u2018talentuous.\u2019 You may perhaps know what it means; I don\u2019t. And since then I\u2019ve never come across the word again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut \u2018mentality\u2019 is more widely used than \u2018talentuous,\u2019\u201d the historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. \u201cI am on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, \u201cI who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, \u201cnor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and the Jockey \u2014 you aren\u2019t in the Jockey, I think, sir?\u201d he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), \u201cI, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard \u2018mentality.\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the same boat, Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhy they can\u2019t produce the proofs of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt. Apparently it\u2019s because the War Minister\u2019s wife was his mistress, that\u2019s what people are saying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I thought it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wife,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019re all equally tiresome about this wretched case,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. \u201cIt can\u2019t make any difference to me, so far as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don\u2019t know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they\u2019re supposed to hold \u2018sound\u2019 views and don\u2019t deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have \u2018Down with the Jews\u2019 printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one\u2019s life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they\u2019re against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; it was the War Minister\u2019s wife; at least, that\u2019s the bedside rumour,\u201d went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. \u201cPersonally, of course, as everyone knows, I take just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine, and I shouldn\u2019t care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of Saint-Loup one doesn\u2019t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect she told him that he would be classed among the \u2018intellectuals.\u2019 The intellectuals, they\u2019re the very cream of those gentry. It\u2019s given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife\u2019s and M. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s benefit, \u201cMater Semita,\u201d which had already made its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us,\u201d he went on, indicating the historian. \u201cBut it is better not to repeat it, especially as there\u2019s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew\u2019s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances,\u201d concluded the Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed \u2018making nuisances\u2019 to mean \u2018making difficulties.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere can be no two opinions;\u201d replied M. de Norpois, \u201chis evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let the Colonel speak. One can\u2019t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does there\u2019s always the risk of falling into a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him, looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: \u2018On my honour as a soldier\u2019\u201d (here M. de Norpois\u2019s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) \u201c\u2018such is my conviction,\u2019 it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; he is a Dreyfusard, there\u2019s not the least doubt of it,\u201d thought Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make,\u201d (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) \u201cwhen one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: \u2018Colonel, sir, you know very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,\u2019 the wind changed; M. Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; evidently he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard; it\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d said Bloch to himself. \u201cBut if he considers Picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with Gribelin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent,\u201d the Duchess broke in, \u201che hasn\u2019t done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. I don\u2019t know whether M. Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can\u2019t be very pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them there\u2019s no way of exchanging innocents.\u201d Everybody laughed. \u201cYou heard what Oriane said?\u201d the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de Villeparisis. \u201cYes; I think it most amusing.\u201d This was not enough for the Duke. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t say that I thought it amusing; or rather it doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don\u2019t care about wit.\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt protested. \u201cIt is probably because I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there to value, more than anything, logic. That\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold.\u201d \u201cBasin, don\u2019t play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do.\u201d \u201cPlease let me finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that I am often struck by my wife\u2019s wit. For you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois\u2019s speaking in this way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that, finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient\u2019s disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctor\u2019s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as Henry\u2019s confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may be quite sure that the War Minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. There are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut those documents are obviously forged,\u201d put in Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince Henri d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBesides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bioch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf it is a conviction,\u201d he said, \u201cit will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince Henri\u2019s outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think Chartres is for Dreyfus?\u201d asked the Duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable Princesse Cl\u00e9mentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe would have preferred a private soldier,\u201d murmured Mme. de Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the Prince de Joinville\u2019s, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: \u201cYes, Sir, of your bracelets.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball this evening?\u201d M. de Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch\u2019s speech of the neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: \u201cHe is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with \u2018The Learned Sisters,\u2019 like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were inclined to be romantic.\u201d But however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t go to balls any more,\u201d she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going, all of you, I suppose? You\u2019re the right age for that sort of thing,\u201d she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, his friend and Bloch. \u201cStill, I was asked,\u201d she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. \u201cIn fact, they came specially to ask me.\u201d (\u2018They\u2019 being the Princesse de Sagan.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t had a card,\u201d said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme. de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these Sagans?\u201d he inquired in a tone of sarcasm\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all, they\u2019re the best we can do for you in that line,\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian society, assured him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen,\u201d said Bloch, still half in irony, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s no good asking me,\u201d answered the Duchess, \u201cI have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides, society isn\u2019t my strong point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; I thought it was just the other way,\u201d said Bloch, who supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the Devil\u2019s Isle. But I think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM. G\u00e9rault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, I don\u2019t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. That certain of your client\u2019s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things,\u201d he added, with a look of great subtlety. \u201cIt is essential that the Government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree, there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: \u2018Present!\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. \u201cShould you fail to disarm,\u201d M. de Norpois went on, without waiting for Bloch\u2019s collective answer, \u201cshould you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them pledges?\u201d Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave him no time. \u201cIf the negative be true, as I should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list \u2014 already too long \u2014 of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece,\u201d he added, looking Bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy\u2019s camp. \u201cGovernment action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under M. Clemenceau\u2019s. We must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou, sir,\u201d said Bloch, turning to M. d\u2019Argencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentleman\u2019s arrival, \u201cyou are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is a question that concerns only the French themselves, don\u2019t you think?\u201d replied M. d\u2019Argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch coloured; M. d\u2019Argencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch\u2019s expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured something to M. d\u2019Argencourt which I could not hear, but which must have referred to Bloch\u2019s religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which one\u2019s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault. \u201cYou, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. Anyhow, I know \u00cf can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so.\u201d But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus, replied: \u201cYou must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention except to Japhetics.\u201d Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to Bloch\u2019s lips something quite different. And we caught only: \u201cBut how on earth did you know? Who told you?\u201d as though he had been the son of a convict. Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet\u2019s article in the Petit Journal). She decided, therefore, to make it plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch\u2019s farewell, barely pencilling on the Marquise\u2019s face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI believe she\u2019s asleep,\u201d said Bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an indignant air. \u201cGood-bye madame,\u201d snouted Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to M. d\u2019Argencourt, while Bloch left the room, convinced that she must be \u2018soft\u2019 in the head. Full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. She received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now of the Seven Princesses, Duchess; you know (not that it\u2019s anything to be proud of) that the author of that \u2014 what shall I call it? \u2014 that production is a compatriot of mine,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a Belgian, by nationality,\u201d he went on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed! No, we don\u2019t accuse you of any responsibility for the Seven Princesses. Fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the Seven Princesses. Besides, if you want to know, it\u2019s not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may tell you that I\u2019m not in the least afraid of a little daring,\u201d she added in a serious tone, \u201cprovided that there is some idea in it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Borelli\u2019s piece. Some people seem to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it,\u201d she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, \u201cI found it immensely interesting. But theSeven Princesses! It\u2019s all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, I cannot carry family feeling quite . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert\u2019s mother. Mme. de Marsantes was regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de Guermantes and Mme. de Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes attended Bruneti\u00e8re\u2019s lectures. She fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone\u2019s sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me, both because I was Robert\u2019s friend and because I did not move in the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the Guermantes: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte,\u201d or \u201cof making the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir\u201d whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that Mme. de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently \u2018honoured.\u2019 Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme. de Marsantes said: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our,\u201d she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call \u2018manners,\u2019 and had given her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of my meeting her: \u201cYou saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman.\u201d But true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de Guermantes, \u201cI\u2019m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don\u2019t wish to know. I thought I\u2019d better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. But you needn\u2019t be afraid, I shall never have her here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It\u2019s Swann\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husband\u2019s racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner\u2019s innocence. When he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women\u2019s leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the Duchess, who held that she was not \u2018bound to\u2019 do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social \u2018free will,\u2019 which was extremely arbitrary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cIt would indeed be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to get away in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you been invited to Lady Israels\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, thank heaven, I don\u2019t know the woman,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cYou must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never could make out why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did indeed know her at one time,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes. \u201cI confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any more. It seems she\u2019s one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again. While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I\u2019ve no right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine,\u201d she went on, having caught some allusion by M. d\u2019Argencourt to Robert. \u201cBut, talking of Robert, haven\u2019t you seen him?\u201d she asked Mme. de Villeparisis; \u201cbeing Saturday, I thought he\u2019d be coming to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him since Balbec.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is so busy; he has so much to do,\u201d pleaded Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law\u2019s behalf. The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert\u2019s pranks. At this point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, talk of the Saint!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on Robert eyes big astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve come! How delightful! What a surprise!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Talk of the Saint! \u2014 I see,\u201d cried the Belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDelicious, ain\u2019t it?\u201d came tartly from the Duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon, Robert,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe he\u2019s forgotten his aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes turned to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon; how are you?\u201d was her greeting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she acted under the fire of Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for I can\u2019t help telling you that he admires you immensely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that\u2019s very nice of him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. \u201cI am most flattered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair,\u201d said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were both silent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you sometimes in the morning,\u201d she said, as though she were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part had never seen her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good for one, a walk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, \u201cyou said you were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at home now that I\u2019ve got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes. \u2018Corona,\u2019 they\u2019re called. I\u2019ve none in the house.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol?\u201d he inquired, in a sur \u2014 prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, you know quite well,\u201d said his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister. It was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, she\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister, I had no idea of that. Really, my family are amazing,\u201d he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch\u2019s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, \u201cthey know the most unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u201d (emphasising the final consonant of each word) \u201cand names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. It\u2019s prodigious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew\u2019s wit. A servant came in to say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBring him in, sir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said the Ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate Minister the favour that was in store for him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I know he\u2019s very sound,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes, \u201cand that is so rare among foreigners. But I\u2019ve found out all about him. He is anti-semitism personified.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince\u2019s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were \u2014 to borrow an expression from music \u2014 attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the \u2018heim\u2019 of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little German watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And so, scarcely had I heard the Prince\u2019s name spoken than, before I had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-o\u2019clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the \u2018Tuesdays\u2019 at the \u2018Fran\u00e7ais.\u2019 He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and \u201ctake the trouble to come so far out of his way,\u201d went himself to the Prince\u2019s residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched his: \u201cI should like immensely to be your colleague,\u201d replied in a tone of deep emotion: \u201cAh! I should be most happy!\u201d And no doubt a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: \u201cWell, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn\u2019t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn\u2019t occurred to him. He lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the support I want, and that is why he doesn\u2019t offer me his; but I have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: \u2018Very well, vote for me, will you?\u2019 and he will be obliged to do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr. Cottard would have called \u2018a fine diplomat\u2019 and he knew that M. de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted, on his country\u2019s behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M. de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: \u201cI realised that I had gone the wrong way to work.\u201d For as soon as he had returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had repeated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know, the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the word \u2018hidebound\u2019 escape me,\u201d he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. \u201cYou understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues\u2019 ideas linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, I should be the first to inform you of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Cordon was a mistake,\u201d thought the Prince; \u201cthe negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently had to deal. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word \u2018Peace,\u2019 nor by the word \u2018War\u2019 that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: \u2018War.\u2019 Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word \u2018War\u2019 or the word \u2018Peace\u2019 was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to \u2018kept\u2019 persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: \u201cDon\u2019t let\u2019s talk about money,\u201d the speech must be regarded as what is called in music \u2018a silent beat\u2019 and that if, later on, she declares: \u201cYou are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; I\u2019ve done with you,\u201d he must interpret this as: \u201cSome one else has been offering me more.\u201d And yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. The apache furnishes more striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word \u2018Perish. But inasmuch as all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his Norpois\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil!\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose any time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before they elect me. That really would be unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M. de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: \u201cStill not the right one!\u201d and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to the door, thought: \u201cDamn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. We must hurry up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear Ambassador,\u201d he began to him, \u201cyou told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince\u2019s tact than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two people to whom I am greatly attached \u2014 in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment \u2014 two people both of whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people \u2014\u2018happy few,\u2019 as Stendhal would say \u2014 but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes, and then (one never knows) if we don\u2019t bore her too much, to spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand Duchess John\u2019s. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuch an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,\u201d replied M. de Norpois; \u201cnothing is more in harmony with the Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu\u2019s, without whom nobody can be elected; I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,\u201d (here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) \u201cand he knows that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s; I will introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my conversation with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme. de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: \u201cAow to you too, Matame la Marquise,\u201d in the accent of an Alsatian porter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWon\u2019t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. \u201cI do the honours in this house just as if it was mine,\u201d she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, \u201cyou won\u2019t forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the Academy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGracious! I must fly at once if I\u2019m to get to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s, and I\u2019m dining with Mme. Leroi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus\u2019s innocence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,\u201d Saint-Loup said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s an ex-whore. Her husband\u2019s a Jew, and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here\u2019s Uncle Palam\u00e8de.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncle\u2019s old servant. This great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned from Fran\u00e7oise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle\u2019s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman\u2019s servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived from saying \u2018you\u2019 to me as often, and \u2018sir\u2019 as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: \u201cTo my best friend.\u201d One actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: \u201cTo the best of friends,\u201d which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some place in which I might keep them, \u201cHow is it,\u201d he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), \u201cthat I don\u2019t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room?\u201d I felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t believe I have such a thing.\u201d \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t one photograph of your uncle Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I\u2014 will send you one of my governor\u2019s \u2014 he has quantities of them \u2014 and I hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle.\u201d It is true that, as I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon discovered that this young man was extremely \u2018pushing.\u2019 Thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So\u2019s. This was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking offence, made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien\u2019s niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, \u201cbut not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople.\u201d Albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,\u2018dear friend,\u2019 I might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as \u201cnot dear master, of course,.. although . . . well, if you like, dear distinguished artist,\u201d once in the shop, I avoided \u2018qualifying\u2019 him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his \u2018you.\u2019 He picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her two \u2018apprentices,\u2019 but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own \u2018station\u2019 (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don\u2019t see at what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of M. Swann . . . \u201d \u201cWhy, if I wasn\u2019t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady\u2019s picture. As a matter of fact, she was \u2018lunching\u2019 with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again.\u201d He broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at Jupien\u2019s niece. She was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that I should have henceforth to identify her with the \u2018Lady in pink.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron\u2019s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious defects in his aunt\u2019s character, was genuinely fond of her. But every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. \u201cBut there was no mistake,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cthe money order cost six francs seventy-five.\u201d \u201cOh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI mentioned it only in case you didn\u2019t know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn\u2019t know you as well as I do, it might have led to unpleasantness.\u201d \u201cNo, no, there was no mistake.\u201d \u201cAfter all, you were quite right,\u201d M. de Charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunt\u2019s hand. And in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had \u2018worked up a regular conspiracy\u2019 against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. \u201cI shall not be satisfied with having my revenge,\u201d he added as a postscript; \u201cI shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly.\u201d Instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knowledge. With the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a dif \u2014 ferent order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!\u201d remarked Saint-Loup. \u201cAnd look at Mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the Baron\u2019s knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the \u2018tecs\u2019 to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus\u2019s face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M. de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow tired and worried you look,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed the expression in Robert\u2019s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind,\u201d his mother went on, stroking his cheek, \u201cnever mind; it\u2019s good to see my little boy again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital \u2018G\u2019 was surmounted by a ducal coronet. I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pleasant man M. de Norpois is,\u201d I said to Mme. Swann, looking at the Ambassador. \u201cIt is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says he\u2019s a pest, but . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is quite right,\u201d she replied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant,\u201d she began, \u201cbut you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an \u2018honest Injun,\u2019 don\u2019t you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s; I don\u2019t know how it was, but your name was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them \u2014 it\u2019s all too silly for words, don\u2019t go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it \u2014 that you were a hypocritical little flatterer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the \u2018world,\u2019 from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances \u2014 in the present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes \u2014 and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays. Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: \u201cDromedary resting.\u201d Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: \u201cThis is you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte. On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?\u201d I asked Mme. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t realise her,\u201d she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from England\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, I know who\u2019 you mean,\u201d she replied with an affectation of contempt, \u201cthe daughter of those rich timber people. I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s begun to go about quite a lot lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme. Lerol would be any addition to what I already have.\u201d Mme. de Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise, presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M. de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince\u2019s honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAm I not right, M. l\u2019Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite uninteresting, isn\u2019t she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, \u201cthere are some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Cr\u00e9billon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMany young women\u2019s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,\u201d said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,\u201d declared M. de Norpois; \u201cI consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I\u2019ve lived all my life among the fields,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly. \u201cBut,\u201d she added graciously, turning to the Prince, \u201cif I did, when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane\u2019s wife, don\u2019t you know?). I remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn\u2019t able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante published some of Mme. de Broglie\u2019s letters, charming and affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have been good to me,\u201d I said, \u201chow can I thank you? Can we dine together to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (At least, he didn\u2019t tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly to me that I simply can\u2019t disappoint him. Between ourselves, on his side at least, I can feel it\u2019s a life and death friendship.\u201d Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a week\u2019s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. \u201cAs for being good,\u201d went on Saint-Loup, \u201cyou say I have been to you, but I haven\u2019t been good at all, my aunt tells me that it\u2019s you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch\u2019s uncle, M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at Nice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our marriage,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo think that for once in his life he wasn\u2019t lying! It\u2019s incredible,\u201d would have been Bloch\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room, I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital \u2018G\u2019 and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs I see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. \u201cI am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019d better take care, sir,\u201d I warned him; \u201cyou have picked up the wrong hat by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to stop me taking my own hat?\u201d I assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say a few words to Saint-Loup. \u201cHe is still talking to that idiot the Duc de Guermantes,\u201d I added. \u201cThat really is charming; I shall tell my brother.\u201d \u201cOh! you think that would interest M. de Charlus?\u201d (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.) \u201cWho has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?\u201d replied the Baron in an arrogant tone. \u201cGo to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. You would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of the necklace,\u201d Robert said to me. \u201cOf course, I never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people don\u2019t look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and that\u2019s not true. And she\u2019s so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, I simply can\u2019t tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don\u2019t want to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron\u2019s and get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that she\u2019s been in the wrong. Don\u2019t you see, it\u2019s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I can\u2019t bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that\u2019s nothing. But with her \u2014 to say to oneself that she\u2019s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels \u2014 I think I shall go mad in a minute \u2014 I\u2019d much rather never see her again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she must; that\u2019s all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller\u2019s and then go and ask her to forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that might settle the whole business. Perhaps,\u201d he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, \u201cwe can all three dine together in the country. But we can\u2019t tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision may be irrevocable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert swept me back to his mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. I don\u2019t know when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall write as soon as I know myself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one\u2019s own family is the natural complement to one\u2019s ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which Rachel\u2019s absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, Robert, you\u2019re going away? Seriously? My little son! The one day I\u2019ve seen anything of you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not at all nice of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he grew angry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but, nice or not, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall leave you here,\u201d he said to me, \u201cbut you\u2019re not to keep him long, Mamma, because he\u2019s got to go somewhere else in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find some excuse for her son\u2019s conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoor boy,\u201d she began, \u201cI am sure I must have hurt him dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasn\u2019t many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris. Oh, dear, if he hadn\u2019t gone already I should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I\u2019m not vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse me if I go and look over the staircase?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I accompanied her there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert! Robert!\u201d she called. \u201cNo; he\u2019s gone; we are too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at an interval of a few hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: \u201cThere now, there\u2019s been trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert\u2019s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. \u201cAt this moment,\u201d Robert\u2019s friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on Rachel\u2019s part, \u201cat this moment she will be in the promenade at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. She\u2019s an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx.\u201d After all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: \u201cShe is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well die \u2014 and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps \u2014 but no, it can never possibly happen.\u201d And in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t know her? I congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don\u2019t know how many men. There isn\u2019t a worse girl in Paris. She\u2019s a common swindler. And cunning isn\u2019t the word!\u201d And perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: \u201cNo, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t had an adventure or two in her time, but she\u2019s not a woman one pays, she\u2019d be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With her it\u2019s fifty thousand francs or nothing.\u201d Well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI blame myself for one thing only,\u201d Mme. de Marsantes murmured in my ear, \u201cand that was my telling him that he wasn\u2019t nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there\u2019s no one else like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him he wasn\u2019t nice to me, I would far rather he\u2019d beaten me, because I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasn\u2019t many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. But, Sir, I mustn\u2019t keep you, since you\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I am in no hurry,\u201d I replied; \u201cbesides, I must wait for M. de Charlus; I am going with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme. de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke light-heartedly and at random\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going from here with my nephew Palam\u00e8de?\u201d she asked me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, \u201cHe has asked me to go home with him,\u201d I answered blithely. \u201cI am so glad. Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I\u2019ve quite made up my mind that we\u2019re going to be better friends still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for him,\u201d she said to me, with a preoccupied air. \u201cHe is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He\u2019s certain to have forgotten what he said to you. You\u2019d much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not, myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of Olympian Zeus which Phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo this is how you wait for me, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we go a little way on foot?\u201d he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. \u201cWe can walk until I find a cab that suits me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wished to speak to me about something, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat sort of politeness means nothing,\u201d he rebuked me coldly. \u201cThere is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one\u2019s while. For the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. Are you worth my trouble or not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of anxiety to you,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut so far as I am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the want of consideration common at your age,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus immediately dismissed them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not what I want,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cit\u2019s all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they\u2019re going in. I hope, Sir,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which I am going to make to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann\u2019s, closer now than at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard \u2014 it was alluded to in a leading article in The Times, which made a considerable impression \u2014 that the Emperor of Austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances.\u201d (This was a favourite expression with M. de Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) \u201cI could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future.\u201d M. de Charlus broke off to question me about Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunt\u2019s drawing-room. And with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for or against Drey, fus. \u201cIt is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life,\u201d went on M. de Charlus when he had finished questioning me, \u201cto include among your friends an occasional foreigner.\u201d I replied that Bloch was French. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI took him to be a Jew.\u201d His assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his protest took this form: \u201cI understand the newspapers to say that Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country \u2014 so I understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is non-existent, your friend\u2019s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with France?\u201d I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. \u201cPerhaps so, and I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his \u2018haggart\u2019) of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel.\u201d As he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose Moli\u00e8resque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de Charlus seemed annoyed. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a woman who made a great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports.\u201d At this point I caught sight of M. Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. \u201cIntroduce him to me! But you must have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might go so far as to express my satisfaction.\u201d As it happened, M. Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme. Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted M. Bloch to her feet. My father\u2019s friend had found Mme. Sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: \u201cM. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful promiscuity!\u201d \u201cBernard,\u201d he had said with pride, on reaching home, to M. Nissim Bernard, \u201cyou know, she has that prejudice!\u201d But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. \u201cAll this Dreyfus business,\u201d went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, \u201chas only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelfies and Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification.\u201d This frivolity in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet us return to yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cand my plans for you. There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You remember the story of the man who believed that he had the Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity. He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great. It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have young relatives who are not \u2014 I do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can tell I must see you often, very often, every day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on M. de Charlus\u2019s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of M. d\u2019Argencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d\u2019Argencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one\u2019s own with which Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d\u2019Argencourt had not recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. Nevertheless I observed that M. d\u2019Argencourt, albeit I had barely been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, and M. de Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry about that,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cThat fellow Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you will honour me by keeping it \u2014 as I shall \u2014 well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears that she is specially well informed on that subject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is nothing of the sort,\u201d replied M. de Charlus tartly. \u201cWomen, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac\u2019s novels, when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice that you must make for me \u2014 I shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts I bestow on you \u2014 is to give up going into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how invaluable I can be to you. The \u2018Open Sesame\u2019 to the Guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him instead what the Villeparisis family was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody family was,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cMy aunt married, for love, a M Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a \u2018Monsieur de Villeparisis,\u2019 a gentleman born at Villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can\u2019t tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. But I had never any impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom I should have applied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt present,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, \u201cby going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesn\u2019t concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving,\u201d he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. \u201cBut the choice of your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really when all\u2019s said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows.\u201d I did not know the meaning of this slang word \u2018renter\u2019; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. \u201cHe is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not help smiling at this epithet \u2018serious,\u2019 to which the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of \u2018virtuous,\u2019 of \u2018steady,\u2019 as one says of a little shop-girl that she is \u2018serious.\u2019 At this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped him. The driver began to argue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYours.\u201d This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to get up on the box. D\u2019you mind if I stay down here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my proposal,\u201d said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, \u201cI give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them again. Damn it, it\u2019s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass. Very well, bear in mind what I\u2019m offering you; you are like Hercules\u2019 (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!\u201d he turned to the cabman, \u201chaven\u2019t you put the hood down? I\u2019ll do it myself. I think, too, I\u2019d better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes\u2019, who was an anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival Leagues, the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise and the Droits de l\u2019Homme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M. Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against France, according to some) that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. The case of the Guermantes\u2019 butler and our own was peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the Guermantes\u2019 butler that he was innocent. This was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the Duke\u2019s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. The Duke\u2019s butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the Devil\u2019s Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the Guermantes household\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My grandmother\u2019s attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: \u201cIll? You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not what they call a diplomatic illness?\u201d He tried to soothe his patient\u2019s restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years\u2019 time. So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother\u2019s mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother\u2019s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient\u2019s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother\u2019s lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: \u201cVery well; I have nothing to say; if it\u2019s like that you may pass,\u201d this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly she seemed to be saying: \u201cWhat use will that be to you? Since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won\u2019t last for ever. And then you\u2019ll be a lot better off.\u201d Thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earth\u2019s first inhabitant \u2014 long anterior to the creation of thinking man \u2014 she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men\u2019s perceives the truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. \u201cAh! I don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s quite possible,\u201d put in Fran\u00e7oise, who was in the room and heard Charcot\u2019s name, as she heard du Boulbon\u2019s, for the first time But this in no way prevented her from saying \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Her \u2018possibles,\u2019 her \u2018perhapses,\u2019 her \u2018I don\u2019t knows\u2019 were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. One wanted to say to her: \u201cNaturally you don\u2019t know, since you haven\u2019t the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether it\u2019s possible or not; you know nothing about it. Anyhow, you can\u2019t say now that you don\u2019t know what Charcot said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you, and your \u2018perhapses\u2019 and \u2018possibles\u2019 don\u2019t come in, because it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s letter on Mme. de la Fayette: \u201cEveryone said she was mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: \u2018Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!\u2019 and I stuck to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out.\u201d Du Boulbon when he came decided against \u2014 if not Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, whom we did not quote to him \u2014 my grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about Bergotte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think so, indeed, he\u2019s magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer? Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother\u2019s memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will be quite well, Madame, on the day \u2014 when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day \u2014 on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I have a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He laid a finger on her wrist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don\u2019t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I have a little albumen as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou ought not to know anything about that. You have what I have had occasion to call \u2018mental albumen.\u2019 We have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you?\u201d \u201cYour grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,\u201d said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: \u201cGo to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add \u2014 what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value \u2014 the most beautiful of antiseptics.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: \u201cProbably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows I can never sleep at all.\u201d But doctors are touchy people. \u201cAch!\u201d muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother\u2019s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a \u2018superior\u2019 person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from Bergotte\u2019S friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou see, Madame, I didn\u2019t know that, and yet I could have told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed,\u201d said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor\u2019s theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms of \u2014 if you\u2019ll excuse my saying so \u2014 mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: \u2018You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.\u2019 Which he would, in fact, have done. \u2018You\u2019re a fine specimen of neurasthenia, that\u2019s what you are,\u2019 I told him. And do you know what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, Madame,\u201d he added with a smile at my grandmother, \u201cfor confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken; they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? No, no; you mustn\u2019t think I\u2019m making fun of your sufferings. I should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them thoroughly. And, well, they say there\u2019s no good confession unless it\u2019s mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. What is more,\u201d he added, raising a solemn forefinger, \u201cthere can be no great scientist either. I will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, I won\u2019t say a good doctor, but I do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a doctor who doesn\u2019t say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I, Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I had gone to secure a room, for \u2014 this is between ourselves \u2014 I spend my holidays there looking after myself when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?\u201d came to a frightened voice from my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards. That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there one of Bergotte\u2019s books. Cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No; I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. You needn\u2019t tell me that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadn\u2019t it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called \u2018imaginary health.\u2019 See, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. Fran\u00e7oise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal \u2018place\u2019 if only she didn\u2019t listen to \u2018stories.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother\u2019s illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup had written to me: \u201cI do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal.\u201d But some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon\u2019s orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. It would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with them to Ville d\u2019Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du Boulbon\u2019s instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. As Fran\u00e7oise had not had time to send a \u2018tube\u2019 to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly consented, however, to call first at Jupien\u2019s, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her into the shop. \u201cIs it your young master who brings you here,\u201d Jupien asked Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cis it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?\u201d For all his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. With Fran\u00e7oise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d\u2019Avray. In my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, if you\u2019re going to meet your friends I ought to have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel, in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for Fran\u00e7oise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s \u2018Marquise\u2019 when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re still here?\u201d he was saying. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of retiring?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there\u2019s all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that\u2019s going on. Just to give you an example, there\u2019s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; he\u2019s a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. Very well, Sir,\u201d she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, \u201cfor the last eight years, do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke of three he\u2019s been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There was one day he didn\u2019t come. I never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: \u2018Why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he\u2019s dead!\u2019 And that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: \u2018I hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?\u2019 Then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and he\u2019d been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn\u2019t been able to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when they\u2019ve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I could to make him feel at home. I said to him: \u2018Y\u2019 mustn\u2019t let go of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018Marquise\u2019 resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd besides,\u201d she went on, \u201cI choose my customers, I don\u2019t let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn\u2019t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such friendly customers I have; there\u2019s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape \u2014 or of being condemned only by default \u2014 from an adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 thinking that I was bored, turned to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me to open a little place for you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, on my declining:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo? You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t?\u201d she persisted, smiling. \u201cWell, just as you please. You\u2019re welcome to it, but I know quite well, not having to pay for a thing won\u2019t make you want to do it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she did not belong to the \u2018Marquise\u2019s\u2019 world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve nothing disengaged, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWill they be long?\u201d asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Ma\u2019am, if you\u2019ll take my advice, you\u2019ll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and I\u2019ve only one closet; the others are out of order.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot much money there,\u201d she explained when the other had gone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort we want here, either; they\u2019re not clean, don\u2019t treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. I\u2019m not sorry to lose her penny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the \u2018Marquise\u2019 would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: \u201cI am afraid I\u2019ve kept you waiting; I hope you\u2019ll still be in time for your friends,\u201d but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you feeling better now?\u201d I asked her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper,\u201d she told me. \u201cCould anything have been more typical of the Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens, what fine language she put it all in!\u201d And she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special Marquise, Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cAs I listened to them I thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, \u201csince your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? I don\u2019t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t like to suggest it, because of your friends,\u201d she replied. \u201cPoor boy! But if you don\u2019t mind, I think it would be wiser.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said to her sharply, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, it\u2019s silly; wait till we get home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We made our way back along the Avenue Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, I was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, I don\u2019t like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. It\u2019s a question of professional etiquette . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of the famous Professor E\u2014 \u2014 almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour\u2019s time, when I have taken her home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCall at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I have torn my coat and my\u2019 other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. You don\u2019t know how the lift works; one can\u2019t be too careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which Professor E\u2014\u2014-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death \u2014 or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again \u2014 may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month\u2019s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes\u2019 time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death \u2014 in this kind of first contact with death \u2014 because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six o\u2019clock, as we came home from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: \u201cWhat does it matter? It is not of the least importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue \u2014 for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium \u2014 has no need of energy. But in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a \u2018sociable\u2019 neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. Or rather it is not the mistress\u2019s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I helped my grandmother into Professor E\u2014\u2014\u2018s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. I then remembered that M. Falli\u00e8res, the President of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother\u2019s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was recalling the example of M. Falli\u00e8res, I was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the Professor\u2019s jokes. After which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is not the slightest hope,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt is a stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard, you\u2019re in excellent hands. Excuse me,\u201d he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother\u2019s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when Fran\u00e7oise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer\u2019s face. Perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother\u2019s altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Fran\u00e7oise. Not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother\u2019s arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Fran\u00e7oise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, my child,\u201d she began, taking my mother\u2019s hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. \u201cSo this is all the pity you shew your mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then for the first time my mother\u2019s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused Fran\u00e7oise unjustly of not \u2018doing\u2019 her bed properly). By a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of Fran\u00e7oise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that Andr\u00e9e was too sorry for Al-bertine to be really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still Fran\u00e7oise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone\u2019s duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should \u2018fail\u2019 us. This doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing \u2014 however little they might previously have sought to oblige \u2014 to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Fran\u00e7oise had contracted also \u2014 and had brought with her to Paris \u2014 the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when my grandmother was so ill Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butler\u2019s example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from Lamartine, just as he might have said \u201cWho laughs last, laughs longest!\u201d or merely \u201cHow are you keeping?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moment\u2019s reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: \u201cAdvance eastwards.\u201d Medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: \u201cOh, it\u2019s dreadful!\u201d but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or \u2014 an alternative stratagem \u2014 repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! My dear, it\u2019s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; I am crying with rage at your orders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is nothing wrong. I\u2019m complaining because I\u2019m not lying very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I knocked myself against the wall.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, Mamma dear, we won\u2019t let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling \u2014 no, you\u2019re not to move.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma\u2019s. It was so altered that probably\u2019 had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her features, like the clay in a sculptor\u2019s hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmother\u2019s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist X \u2014\u2014-he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as Fran\u00e7oise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus\u2019s bottle. My grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. According to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To each of us he said: \u201cI should like to have another look at that little cornea. Don\u2019t put it off too long. I can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle.\u201d We were, of course, thinking of something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother\u2019s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother\u2019s room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalid\u2019s bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the \u2018man with the little beard\u2019 whom I had seen so alert, not very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. A man\u2019s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He would say, for instance: \u201cThe hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads\u201d (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly along those roads) \u201cwhich started every five minutes from Briand and Claudel.\u201d At that point I ceased to understand, because I had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the \u2018bridge-ladder.\u2019 I felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was Renoir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. When it is at an end the operator says to us: \u201cNow look!\u201d And, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages, too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This writer who had taken Bergotte\u2019s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations \u2014 perfectly coherent \u2014 which my mind was not trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover, when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in Homer\u2019s day, and science with its continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years\u2019 time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From that moment my friend\u2019s features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf\u00e9, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might \u2014 very rarely \u2014 talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: \u201cSee that you don\u2019t forget to thank him nicely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had also \u2014 a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painter\u2019s mistress \u2014 a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme. Cottard. She came to offer us her \u2018waiting-woman,\u2019 or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would \u2018scour the country\u2019 for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a \u2018put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride\u2019s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother\u2019s illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mother\u2019s expressions: \u201cS\u00e9vign\u00e9 would not have put it better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother\u2019s entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) Fran\u00e7oise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien. This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother\u2019s illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. But Franchise\u2019s code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmother\u2019s condition ceased at once to matter. When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. Fran\u00e7oise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which Fran\u00e7oise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over Fran\u00e7oise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the \u2018poor Russians,\u2019 \u201csince,\u201d she reminded us, \u201cwe\u2019re allianced to them.\u201d She felt this abstention to be not quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always \u201csaid such nice things about us\u201d; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien, knowing that it would \u2018upset\u2019 her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at death\u2019s door, the same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the family of an invalid: \u201cYou haven\u2019t tried taking him away for a little . . . the change of air, you know . . . pick up an appetite . . . etc?\u201d she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people\u2019s heads: \u201cShe ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first.\u201d She did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were \u2018radical.\u2019 As for Fran\u00e7oise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of France, some cousins \u2014 relatively well-to-do \u2014 whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all this seemed to Fran\u00e7oise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. Fran\u00e7oise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother\u2019s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother\u2019s eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with one\u2019s eyes. Finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think. Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery \u2014 so obscure, for all that \u2014 of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman. . . \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, Fran\u00e7oise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt Madame Am\u00e9d\u00e9e,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cif I just comb her; nobody\u2019s ever too ill for a good combing.\u201d In other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel hands of Fran\u00e7oise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Fran\u00e7oise would have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: \u201cThat is enough,\u201d for fear of her disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, Fran\u00e7oise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in some way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard was in two minds. Fran\u00e7oise hoped at first that they were going to apply \u2018clarified cups.\u2019 She looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. Even if she had said \u2018scarified\u2019 instead of \u2018clarified\u2019 she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under \u2018S\u2019 than under \u2018C\u2019; she did indeed say \u2018clarified\u2019 but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) \u2018esclarified.\u2019 Cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother\u2019s room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Fran\u00e7oise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: \u201cOh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame.\u201d This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, Fran\u00e7oise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of \u2018trying-on.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForgive me for disturbing your sleep,\u201d she said to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was not asleep,\u201d I answered as I awoke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said this in good faith. The great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: \u201cI was asleep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? Yes, I could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother\u2019s forehead. It was the only thing that refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those \u2018extra helps\u2019 whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: I could not escape him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father.\u201d I made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake. And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,\u201d he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were \u2018quite the best\u2019 in their respective lines. And the old Duchesse de Mortemart n\u00e9eGuermantes (I never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess, one almost invariably says: \u201cThe old Duchess of So-and-so\u201d or, alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young: \u201cThe little Duchess of So-and-so,\u201d) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: \u201cDieulafoy, Dieulafoy!\u201d as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: \u2018Poir\u00e9 Blanche,\u2019 or for small pastry \u2018Rebattet, Rebattet.\u2019 But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for Dieulafoy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of \u201cSir, Sir, Sir,\u201d dragged me across to Mamma, saying: \u201cWill you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother?\u201d letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. \u201cI say, this is a piece of luck!\u201d cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the house, carried off by his uncle who \u2014 having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to Donci\u00e8res on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. \u201cUpon my soul, if anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend M. Bloch would say, it\u2019s a regular farce.\u201d And as he disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the shoulder: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s quite clear I must have touched the hangman\u2019s rope or something; I do have the most astounding luck.\u201d Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: \u201cThis is a very painful occasion,\u201d after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a \u2018lift\u2019 in their carriage when it is time to go home. The Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the \u2018good wind\u2019 that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception \u2014 natural as it was \u2014 that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had \u2018absent fits\u2019 during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite \u2018all there.\u2019 At the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly \u2018affected\u2019 by the sad event. But he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of Mamma\u2019s sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid\u2019s face. At one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this cleric\u2019s grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly. He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me. In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother\u2019s breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art \u2014 as simple as that need was futile \u2014 of giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother\u2019s case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to repeat: \u201cIt makes me feel all queer,\u201d in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: \u201cIt\u2019s like a load on my stomach,\u201d sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as \u2018the Cambrousse\u2019 and where she felt herself growing \u2018p\u00e9trousse,\u2019 in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, Fran\u00e7oise felt, to be a superb spectacle. Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. She was determined at least to \u2018go over it all\u2019 with him on his return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. He was always \u2018sent for\u2019 in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t come \u2018to-morrow.\u2019 Please, for \u2018her sake.\u2019 At any rate, you won\u2019t go \u2018all the way.\u2019 It\u2019s what she would have wished.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive \u2018at the house,\u2019 by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of \u2018No flowers by request.\u2019 And before attending everything he had always \u2018attended to everything,\u2019 which entitled him to the formula: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing,\u201d answered the cousin. \u201cI was just saying that I\u2019d heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down there, and here we\u2019ve got too much sun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYet the barometer is very low,\u201d put in my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you say the weather was bad?\u201d asked my grandfather\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt Combray.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I\u2019m not surprised; whenever it\u2019s bad here it\u2019s fine at Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having \u2018remembered\u2019 it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: \u201cM. Dieulafoy,\u201d one imagined oneself at a play by Moli\u00e8re. To the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: \u201cProfessor Dieulafoy.\u201d But already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurer\u2019s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity \u2014 which was increased rather \u2014 of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the \u2018capacity\u2019 in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: \u201cOld Norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, he\u2019ll be so gratified if you do,\u201d my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. A couple of days earlier \u2014 to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying \u2014 while they were watching by the body, Fran\u00e7oise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: \u201cI believe that\u2019s her.\u201d But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return now to those last hours, \u201cYou heard about the telegram her sisters sent us?\u201d my grandfather asked the cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it\u2019s worth framing; still, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor wife, who was so fond of them, too,\u201d said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re stark mad, both of them, as I\u2019ve always said. What\u2019s the matter now; aren\u2019t you going on with the oxygen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother spoke: \u201cOh, but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor reassured her: \u201cOh, no! The effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother\u2019s pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my grandmother\u2019s being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I thought she couldn\u2019t see anything now?\u201d said my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne can never be sure,\u201d replied the doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my lips touched her face, my grandmother\u2019s hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Fran\u00e7oise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room. At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself hurriedly in front of Fran\u00e7oise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My grandmother was dead\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour or two later Fran\u00e7oise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. Life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. A smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmother\u2019s lips.

Take control of your mind and make you jump in a pond\nGo \"quack quack\" and flap your arms, leave you confused, but completely unharmed\n\nCareful with that mic, Weezy\nDo you really think it's that

seductions of violence\nPeople walking around with ugly auras\nAt times I'm even tempted to seek the advice of Dr. Laura\nBut I ignore her\n\nSo I take a deep breath and count to ten\nAin't gonna let it get under my skin\nTake a deep breath and count to ten\nThink of all the nice places that I\u2019ve been\n\nLike back when I was waging peace against the Visigoths\nI was tutored in the ancient mysteries by a wizened philosophe\nLearned the polyrhythm of celestial time\nAnd wait for the one to come and get it done to finish the rhyme\n\nCareful with that mic, Weezy\nDo you really think it's
